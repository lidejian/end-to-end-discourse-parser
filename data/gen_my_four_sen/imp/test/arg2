The 49 stock specialist firms on the Big Board floor -- the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the 1987 crash -- once again could n't handle the selling pressure . 
Heavy selling of Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index futures in Chicago relentlessly beat stocks downward . 
`` The equity market was illiquid . Once again -LCB- the specialists -RCB- were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange , '' said Christopher Pedersen , senior vice president at Twenty-First Securities Corp . 
Once again -LCB- the specialists -RCB- were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange , '' said Christopher Pedersen , senior vice president at Twenty-First Securities Corp . 
When the dollar is in a free-fall , even central banks ca n't stop it . 
Final-hour trading accelerated to 108.1 million shares , a record for the Big Board . 
At the end of the day , 251.2 million shares were traded . 
The Dow Jones industrials closed at 2569.26 . 
The Dow fell 22.6 % on Black Monday . 
Wall Street 's takeover-stock speculators , or `` risk arbitragers , '' had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and UAL stock would rise . 
On the exchange floor , `` as soon as UAL stopped trading , we braced for a panic , '' said one top floor trader . 
Several traders could be seen shaking their heads when the news flashed . 
Arbitragers could n't dump their UAL stock -- but they rid themselves of nearly every `` rumor '' stock they had . 
When trading was halted in Philip Morris , the stock was trading at 41 , down 3 3\/8 , while IBM closed 5 5\/8 lower at 102 . 
Most of the stock selling pressure came from Wall Street professionals , including computer-guided program traders . 
Under an agreement signed by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , trading was temporarily halted in Chicago . 
Without the guidepost of stock-index futures -- the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed -- many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the Big Board . 
The futures halt was even assailed by Big Board floor traders . 
`` It screwed things up , '' said one major specialist . 
`` We did n't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do . '' 
The Dow industrials were down 55 points at 3 p.m. before the futures-trading halt . 
At 3:30 p.m. , at the end of the `` cooling off '' period , the average was down 114.76 points . 
I just think it 's nonproductive at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things . '' 
Buyers stepped in to the futures pit . 
Futures traders say the S&P was signaling that the Dow could fall as much as 200 points . 
It would be my inclination to advise clients not to sell , to look for an opportunity to buy , '' Mr. Ball told the brokers . 
The release cautioned that `` there are significant differences between the current environment and that of October 1987 '' and that there are still `` attractive investment opportunities '' in the stock market . 
It 's going to bring the debate right back to the forefront . '' 
Jeffrey Yass of program trader Susquehanna Investment Group said 2,000 S&P contracts were for sale on the close , the equivalent of $ 330 million in stock . 
Stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself . 
At those levels , stocks are set up to be hammered by index arbitragers , who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall , and simultaneously sell off stocks . 
Obviously we 'll take a close look at any situation in which we think the dealer-community obligations were n't met , '' he said . 
Mr. Phelan said , `` It will take another day or two '' to analyze who was buying and selling Friday . 
It 's now the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , comprising Wales , Northern Ireland , Scotland , and ... oh yes , England , too . 
We want to build and hold . '' 
Its parent company , Hooker Corp. of Sydney , Australia , is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator . 
Not included in the bid are Bonwit Teller or B. Altman & Co. , L.J. Hooker 's department-store chains . 
The company grew modestly until 1986 , when a majority position in Hooker Corp. was acquired by Australian developer George Herscu , currently Hooker 's chairman . 
Since then , Hooker Corp. has sold its interest in the Parisian chain back to Parisian 's management and is currently attempting to sell the B. Altman & Co. chain . 
The Merksamer chain is currently being offered for sale by First Boston Corp . 
`` These are n't mature assets , but they have the potential to be so , '' said Mr. Shidler . `` Managed properly , and with a long-term outlook , these can become investment-grade quality properties . 
`` Managed properly , and with a long-term outlook , these can become investment-grade quality properties . 
They will be available in minimum denominations of $ 10,000 . 
The Boston firm said stock-fund redemptions were running at less than one-third the level two years ago . 
As of yesterday afternoon , the redemptions represented less than 15 % of the total cash position of about $ 2 billion of Fidelity 's stock funds . 
`` This feels more like a one-shot deal . 
People are n't panicking . '' 
Friday 's stock market sell-off came too late for many investors to act . 
Some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after Friday 's close would take place at today 's closing prices . 
Stock fund redemptions during the 1987 debacle did n't begin to snowball until after the market opened on Black Monday . 
Many have raised cash levels , which act as a buffer against steep market declines . 
Windsor Fund 's John Neff and Mutual Series ' Michael Price said they had raised their cash levels to more than 20 % and 30 % , respectively , this year . 
One reason is that after two years of monthly net redemptions , the fund posted net inflows of money from investors in August and September . 
That was modestly higher than the 8.8 % and 9.2 % levels in August and September of 1987 . 
A major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since Black Monday . 
Stock-fund sales have rebounded in recent months , but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half 1987 levels . 
Vincent Bajakian , manager of the $ 1.8 billion Wellington Fund , added to his positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb , Woolworth and Dun & Bradstreet Friday . 
If the market drops further today , he said he 'll be buying blue chips such as Bristol-Myers and Kellogg . 
`` If they croak stocks like that , '' he said , it presents an opportunity that is `` the kind of thing you dream about . '' 
Trading volume was only modestly higher than normal . 
They hope to avoid the jammed phone lines and other snags that infuriated some fund investors in October 1987 . 
The centers normally are closed through the weekend . 
`` We view -LCB- Friday 's -RCB- market decline as offering us a buying opportunity as long-term investors , '' a recording at Gabelli & Co. funds said over the weekend . 
The Janus Group had a similar recording for investors . 
Some early selling is likely to stem from investors and portfolio managers who want to lock in this year 's fat profits . 
Stock funds have averaged a staggering gain of 25 % through September , according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc . 
`` This is not a major crash , '' she said . 
She added , `` If they all were bullish , I 'd really be upset . '' 
Two years ago , unlike today , the dollar was weak , interest rates were rising and the market was very overvalued , they say . 
This time , `` I do n't think we 'll get a panic reaction . 
Now , those routes are n't expected to begin until Jan . 
Those , too , are almost certain to arrive late . 
`` I do n't think their customers would like it very much . '' 
`` I figure that American and United probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets , they might not miss one at all , '' Mr. Otradovec said . 
Southwest Airlines has a Boeing 737-300 set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time . 
`` It 's so close to completion , Boeing 's told us there wo n't be a problem , '' said a Southwest spokesman . 
American is preparing to take delivery of another 757 in early December and 20 more next year and is n't anticipating any changes in that timetable . 
`` We want to make sure they know what they want before they come back , '' said Doug Hammond , the federal mediator who has been in contact with both sides since the strike began . 
Though Boeing 's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market Friday , it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders . 
`` The market has taken two views : that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very rosy for Boeing in the long term , '' said Howard Rubel , an analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc . 
Boeing 's shares fell $ 4 Friday to close at $ 57.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange . 
`` I would n't expect an immediate resolution to anything . '' 
He added that the company miscalculated the union 's resolve and the workers ' disgust with being forced to work many hours overtime . 
It had planned a strike vote for next Sunday , but that has been pushed back indefinitely . 
They can be C$ 1 billion plus , '' Mr. Richardson said . 
`` Ideally , we 'd like to be the operator -LCB- of the project -RCB- and a modest equity investor . 
The planned electric utility sale , scheduled for next year , is alone expected to raise # 13 billion , making it the world 's largest public offering . 
`` This is a real thrust on our utility side , '' he said , adding that Canadian Utilities is also mulling projects in underdeveloped countries , though he would be specific . 
`` We 're certainly looking at some power generating projects in England , '' said Bruce Stram , vice president , corporate strategy and corporate planning , with Enron Corp. , Houston , a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator . 
In a Centennial Journal article Oct. 5 , the fares were reversed . 
Typically , developers option property , and then once they get the administrative approvals , they buy it , '' said Mr. Karatz , adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind . 
`` We usually operate in that conservative manner . '' 
The company is putting up only 10 % of the capital , although it is responsible for providing management , planning and processing services to the joint venture . 
The company outpaced much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew fivefold in two years . 
Some securities analysts are looking for no better than break-even results from the company for the third quarter , compared with year-earlier profit of $ 99.8 million , or $ 3.92 a share , on sales of $ 724.4 million . 
Having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history , these producers now see their prices eroding . 
`` We were all wonderful heroes last year , '' says an executive at one of Quantum 's competitors . `` Now we 're at the bottom of the heap . '' 
`` Now we 're at the bottom of the heap . '' 
Once known as National Distillers & Chemical Corp. , the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics after Mr. Stookey took the chief executive 's job in 1986 . 
Benchmark grades , which still sold for as much as 50 cents a pound last spring , have skidded to between 35 cents and 40 cents . 
China , which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene , abruptly halted them . 
`` People were even hoarding bags , '' he says . 
Noting others ' estimates of when price increases can be sustained , he remarks , `` Some say October . Some say November . I say 1992 . '' 
Some say November . 
I say 1992 . '' 
He argues that efforts to firm up prices will be undermined by producers ' plans to expand production capacity . 
The company is trying to carry out a three-year , $ 1.3 billion plant-expansion program started this year . 
Some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to dispel takeover speculation . 
Then a second explosion occurred . Two workers died and six remain in the hospital . After an explosion idled the plant in June , the company progressed in September to within 12 hours of completing the drawn-out process of restarting it . 
Two workers died and six remain in the hospital . 
Until this year , the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up trade-group safety awards . 
When a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand , calculating lost profit and thus claims under business-interruption insurance is straightforward . But the numbers become trickier -- and subject to dickering between insured and insurer -- when demand is shifting . 
The plant expansion should strengthen the company 's sway in the polyethylene business , where market share is often taken through sheer capacity . 
By lifting ethylene production , the expansion will also lower the company 's raw material costs . 
Through a venture with its investment banker , First Boston Corp. , Quantum completed in August an acquisition of Petrolane Inc. in a transaction valued at $ 1.18 billion . 
The largest , Suburban Propane , was already owned by Quantum . 
Some analysts speculate the weakening stock may yet attract a suitor . 
The name surfacing in rumors is British Petroleum Co. , which is looking to expand its polyethylene business in the U.S. . 
The spokesman said RJR is discussing its network-buying plans with its two main advertising firms , FCB\/Leber Katz and McCann Erickson . 
One employee with the group said RJR moved 11 employees of the group back to New York in September because `` there was supposed to be a future . '' 
He said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks , wooing them from jobs with advertising agencies . 
`` The studies -LCB- on closing the unit -RCB- could n't be completed until now , '' he said . 
Brazil and Venezuela are the only two countries that have n't completed steel talks with the U.S. for the year ending Oct. 1 , 1990 . 
Of the remaining 20 % needed , the steel-quota negotiations allocate about 15 % to foreign suppliers , with the difference supplied mainly by Canada -- which is n't included in the quota program . 
Other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the U.S. , such as Taiwan , Sweden and Argentina , also have supplied steel . 
The U.S. termed its plan , a `` trade liberalization program , '' despite the fact that it is merely an extension . 
South Korea , which had 1.9 % under the previous quotas , is set to get a small increase to about 1.95 % . 
That increase rises to slightly more than 2 % of the U.S. market if a joint Korean-U.S. steel project is included . 
The EC steel industry , which has been coping with strong European demand , has been supplying about 5 % of the U.S. market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7 % . 
Japan has been shipping steel to total about 4.5 % of the U.S. market compared with a quota of 5.9 % . 
The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters , such as Australia and Venezuela . 
That was essentially made up of a 1 % increase in the overall quota program and 1 % from cutting Japan 's allowance . 
Revenue totaled $ 5 million . 
George Pierce , chairman and chief executive officer , said in an interview that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $ 4 million . 
Although Mr. Pierce expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year , he said Elcotel will also benefit from moving into other areas . 
Within the next year , Elcotel expects to place 10,000 fax machines , made by Minolta in Japan , in hotels , municipal buildings , drugstores and other public settings around the country . 
Elcotel will provide a credit-card reader for the machines to collect , store and forward billing data . 
Automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone , Mr. Pierce said , not just phones produced by Elcotel . 
`` They do n't want to get caught again , '' says one industry watcher . 
She said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others . 
The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after watching the success of Attack . 
When Attack hit the shelves in 1987 , P&G 's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 % . 
With the help of Lemon Cheer , P&G 's share is now estimated to be 12 % . 
; many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine , believing that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry . 
`` When shelf space was cheap , bigger was better , '' says Hugh Zurkuhlen , an analyst at Salomon Bros . 
If the new Cheer sells well , the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own superconcentrates . 
To be sure , Kao would n't have an easy time taking U.S. market share away from the mighty P&G , which has about 23 % of the market . 
`` This is something P&G would do with or without Kao , '' says Mr. Zurkuhlen . 
They expected a new barrage of demands that Japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S. . 
Mrs. Hills ' first trip to Japan as America 's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month 's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher . 
He said such results should be `` measurable in dollars and cents '' in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan . 
She added that she expected `` perhaps to have a down payment ... some small step to convince the American people and the Japanese people that we 're moving in earnest . '' 
Many called it simply a contrast in styles . 
Others said the Bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand . 
`` I am painted sometimes as ferocious , perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes to implement . 
I do n't feel very ferocious . 
I do n't feel either hard or soft . 
I feel committed to the program of opening markets and expanding trade . '' 
She highlighted exclusionary business practices that the U.S. government has identified . 
She said the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and should n't be tackled by setting quantitative targets . 
`` My impression was that you would be a scary old lady , '' he said , drawing a few nervous chuckles from his colleagues . 
Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as assuring U.S. companies a 20 % share by 1991 , but the Japanese have denied making any such promise . 
I will not enter into an agreement that stipulates to a percentage of the market . 
In the latest nine months net income was $ 4.7 million , or $ 1.31 a share , on revenue of $ 44.3 million . 
It said the delay resulted from difficulties in resolving its accounting of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission . 
The gasoline picture may improve this quarter , but chemicals are likely to remain weak , industry executives and analysts say , reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance . 
`` That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings '' for the industry in general , he added . 
It has plunged 13 % since July to around 26 cents a pound . 
A year ago ethylene sold for 33 cents , peaking at about 34 cents last December . 
Companies added capacity furiously . 
Now , greatly increased supplies are on the market , while the dollar is stronger , and domestic economic growth is slower . 
`` Refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year , '' said William Randol , a securities analyst at First Boston Corp . 
The excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period . 
During the 1988 second half , many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits . 
Prices -- averaging roughly $ 2 a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier -- have stayed well above most companies ' expectations . 
Demand has been much stronger than anticipated , and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter . 
`` We could see higher oil prices this year , '' said Bryan Jacoboski , an analyst at PaineWebber Inc . 
In the third quarter , they averaged about 5 % less than they were in 1988 . 
The main reason remains weather . 
Last summer was notable for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to burn more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air conditioning use . 
To make its point , it is challenging the Italian government to explain reports that Olivetti may have supplied the Soviet Union with sophisticated computer-driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft . 
Olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in 1984 . 
Italian President Francesco Cossiga promised a quick investigation into whether Olivetti broke Cocom rules . 
`` It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important Cocom meeting , '' said a Washington lobbyist for a number of U.S. computer companies . 
Last summer , Mr. Bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the Cocom embargo of strategic goods . But more recently , the Pentagon and the Commerce Department openly feuded over the extent to which Cocom should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc . 
`` There 's no evidence that the Soviet program to -LRB- illegally -RRB- acquire Western technology has diminished , '' said a State Department spokesman . 
At this price , the shares would have to rise above HK$ 6.05 for subscribers to Salomon 's issue to profitably convert their warrants . 
Financial Corp. purchased the bonds , the suit alleged , after Mr. Boesky and Drexel negotiated an agreement for Vagabond Hotels to purchase a 51 % stake in the thrift for about $ 34 million . 
Ideal 's directors rejected that offer , although they said they endorsed the merger proposal . 
The government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about 66 million bushels . 
It now estimates production for next year at just under 2.6 billion bushels , compared with this year 's estimated 2.04 billion and a drought-stunted 1.81 billion in 1988 . 
Until then , limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $ 4-a-bushel level , analysts say . 
On the Chicago Board of Trade Friday , wheat for December delivery settled at $ 4.0675 a bushel , unchanged . 
The exchange said it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the Italian conglomerate , which had refused requests to reduce its holdings . 
Ferruzzi has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market . 
That figure climbs to about 47 % in wheat-growing portions of Kansas , he said . 
`` Wheat prices will increasingly pivot off of Soviet demand '' in coming weeks , predicted Richard Feltes , vice president , research , for Refco Inc. in Chicago . 
It was near the low range of estimates , at 130 million 90-pound boxes , compared with 146.6 million boxes last season . 
Friday 's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the U.S. report might have had and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time . 
It settled with a loss of 4.95 cents at $ 1.3210 a pound . 
Brazil wants to stimulate demand for its product , which is going to be in plentiful supply . 
It 's a dollar-priced product , and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in Europe , the analyst said . 
Barring a cold snap or other crop problems in the growing areas , downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into January , when harvesting and processing of oranges in Florida reach their peak , the analyst said . 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange , West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery finished at $ 20.89 a barrel , up 42 cents on the day . 
He predicted that the November contract will reach $ 21.50 a barrel or more on the New York Mercantile Exchange . 
Analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and crudes . 
Many traders foresee a tightening of near-term supplies , particularly of high-quality crudes such as those produced in the North Sea and in Nigeria . 
Mr. Spielvogel said he would n't launch a hostile bid . 
The executive said any buy-out would be led by the current board , whose chairman is Maurice Saatchi and whose strategic guiding force is believed to be Charles Saatchi . 
That speculation abounded Friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive , Robert Louis-Dreyfus , who joins Saatchi and becomes a member of its board on Jan. 1 . 
Mr. Louis-Dreyfus , formerly chief executive of the pharmaceutical research firm IMS International Inc. , has a reputation as a savvy financial manager , and will be charged largely with repairing Saatchi 's poor financial state . 
He was brought in to turn around the company . '' 
John Lampe , director of advertising at PaineWebber Inc. , a Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising client , said : `` We have no problem with the announcement , because we do n't know what change it 's going to bring about . 
We are n't going to change agencies because of a change in London . '' 
Executives at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , a Backer Spielvogel client that is reviewing its account , declined comment . 
Mr. Spielvogel had said that Prudential-Bache was prepared to finance either a management buy-out and restructuring , or a buy-out of Backer Spielvogel alone , led by him . 
Bozell Cheil Corp. , as the new agency will be called , will be based in Seoul and is 70 % owned by Samsung and 30 % owned by Bozell . 
Revenue soared to $ 117 million from $ 81.5 million . 
Maxtor said effects from discontinuing the line may have a positive effect on future earnings and revenue . 
A spokeswoman would n't elaborate , but the company said the discontinued product has never been a major source of revenue or profit . 
Revenue rose to $ 225.5 million from $ 161.8 million . 
The company asked for a 15-day extension Sept. 30 , when the financial reports were due . 
It said it is considering `` all of its options in light of the decision , including a possible appeal . '' 
The medical-products company added that it plans to `` assert its other defenses '' against Pharmacia 's lawsuit , including the claim that it has n't infringed on Pharmacia 's patent . 
In New York , the Bonwit Teller and B. Altman & Co. department stores have filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code , while the R.H. Macy & Co. , Bloomingdale 's and Saks Fifth Avenue department-store chains are for sale . 
All bets are off , analysts say , because of the shifting ownership of the retail chains . 
`` Retailers are just in disarray . '' 
Gannett 's 83 daily and 35 non-daily newspapers reported a 3 % increase in advertising and circulation revenue . 
Total advertising linage was `` modestly '' lower as classified-ad volume increased , while there was `` softer demand '' for retail and national ad linage , said John Curley , Gannett 's chief executive officer . 
In the nine months , Gannett 's net rose 9.5 % to $ 270 million , or $ 1.68 a share , from $ 247 million , or $ 1.52 a share . 
Revenue gained 6 % to $ 2.55 billion from $ 2.4 billion . 
Net fell to $ 28.8 million , or 29 cents a share , from $ 32 million , or 33 cents a share . 
The year-earlier period included a one-time gain of $ 3.5 million , or four cents a share . 
Ad linage at the Journal fell 6.1 % in the third quarter . 
The publisher of the Boston Globe reported net of $ 8.5 million , or 12 cents a share , compared with a loss of $ 26.5 million , or 38 cents a share , for the third quarter in 1988 . 
After a supply crunch caused prices to rise 14 % since 1986 to $ 650 a metric ton , analysts are encouraged , because they do n't expect a price increase for the rest of this year . 
Mr. Atorino at Salomon Brothers said he estimates that Times Mirror Co. 's earnings were down for the third quarter , because of soft advertising levels at its Long Island Newsday and Hartford Courant newspapers . 
Trouble on the East Coast was likely offset by improved ad linage at the Los Angeles Times , which this week also unveiled a redesign . 
The company , currently using about 80 % of its North American vehicle capacity , has vowed it will run at 100 % of capacity by 1992 . 
Just a month ago , GM announced it would make an aging assembly plant in Lakewood , Ga. , the eighth U.S. assembly facility to close since 1987 . 
One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U.S. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than GM can match . 
Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no-layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that will be negotiated next year . 
GM officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin . 
Against that backdrop , UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich , who recently became head of the union 's GM department , issued a statement Friday blasting GM 's `` flagrant insensitivity '' toward union members . 
The auto maker 's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed `` disarray '' and an `` inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information , '' Mr. Yokich said . 
That means two plants -- one in Scarborough , Ontario , and the other in Lordstown , Ohio -- probably will be shut down after the end of 1991 . 
Robert White , Canadian Auto Workers union president , used the impending Scarborough shutdown to criticize the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement and its champion , Prime Minister Brian Mulroney . 
GM is studying whether it can build the new Camaro-Firebird profitably at a plant in St. Therese , Quebec , company and union officials said . 
The Van Nuys plant , which employs about 3,000 workers , does n't have a product to build after 1993 . 
Jerry Shrieves , UAW local president , said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a `` flex plant , '' which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand . 
He said he believes GM has plans to keep building A-body cars into the mid-1990s . 
Dissident UAW members have used the Fiero plant as a symbol of labor-management cooperation 's failure . 
Canadian investment rules require that big foreign takeovers meet that standard . 
Alan Nymark , executive vice president of Investment Canada , which oversees foreign takeovers , said it marked the first time in its four-year history that the agency has made an adverse net-benefit decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded company . 
He said it has reached the same conclusions about some attempts to buy closely held concerns , but eventually allowed those acquisitions to proceed . 
; this provision has been used before , '' said Jodi Redmond , press secretary for Harvie Andre , Canada 's minister of industry , science and technology . 
The University is seeking to block the acquisition of Connaught by foreign interests , citing concerns about the amount of research that would be done in Canada . 
The exchange ratio was never established . 
Weatherford suspended its preferred-dividend payment in October 1985 and said it has n't any plans to catch up on dividends in arrears about $ 6 million , but will do so some time in the future . 
Less robust earnings at Pfizer Inc. and Upjohn Co. were attributed to those companies ' older products , many of which face stiffening competition from generic drugs and other medicines . 
While that 's not spectacular , Neil Sweig , an analyst with Prudential Bache , said that the rate of growth will `` look especially good as compared to other companies if the economy turns downward . '' 
Profit climbed even though Merck 's sales were reduced by `` one to three percentage points '' as a result of the strong dollar , Mr. Sweig said . 
In the third quarter of 1988 , Merck earned $ 311.8 million , or 79 cents a share . 
The drug , introduced last year , is expected to generate sales of about $ 300 million this year . 
`` It 's turning out to be a real blockbuster , '' Mr. Sweig said . 
The company 's lean operation , analysts said , allowed sharp-rising sales from its cholesterol drug , Lopid , to power earnings growth . 
Lopid sales are expected to be about $ 300 million this year , up from $ 190 million in 1988 . 
In Morris Plains , N.J. , a spokesman for the company said the analysts ' projections are `` in the ballpark . '' 
The company expects to achieve the 20 % increase in full-year earnings per share , as it projected in the spring , the spokesman said . 
Sales of Pfizer 's important drugs , Feldene for treating arthritis , and Procardia , a heart medicine , have shrunk because of increased competition . 
`` The -LRB- strong -RRB- dollar hurt Pfizer a lot , too , '' Mr. Sweig said . 
It said analysts had been expecting a small profit for the period . 
Relational Technology reported net income of $ 1.5 million , or 12 cents a share , in the year-earlier period . 
A spokesman said the company 's first quarter is historically soft , and computer companies in general are experiencing slower sales . 
The company said Mr. Wilson 's resignation was n't related to the sales shortfall . 
Its high for the past year was $ 16.375 a share . 
In a lovely , novelistic memoir , `` Sleeping Arrangements '' -LRB- Knopf , 195 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- , she remembers an exotic playground , peopled mainly by Jewish eccentrics and the occasional Catholic -LRB- real oddballs like her sexpot friend , the hell-kitten Diana , age five -RRB- . 
She transforms her `` Bronx of the emotions , a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria '' into the `` Babylonian Bronx , '' a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue . 
In the Babylonian Bronx , Jewish working-class people lived in drab , Soviet-style buildings `` glamorized '' with names like AnaMor Towers -LRB- after owners Anna and Morris Snezak -RRB- , whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient Syrians and Greeks , friezes of Pompeii . 
She was raised , for the first eight years , by her mother , Rosie , whom she remembers as a loving liar , who realigned history to explain why Lily 's father did n't live with them . 
Rosie reinvented this man , who may or may not have known about his child , as a war hero for Lily 's benefit . 
`` Without official knowledge of sex or death , we flirted with both , '' she writes . 
Her friend Susan , whose parents kept reminding her she was unwanted , slept on a narrow bed wedged into her parents ' bedroom , as though she were a temporary visitor . 
Her friend Diana 's father was a professional thief ; they did n't seem to have any bedrooms at all . 
When Rosie died , her uncles moved in -- and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements . 
They painted the apartment orange , pink and white , according to her instructions . 
Lily 's grandmother , no cookie baker , excised the heads of disliked relatives from the family album , and lugged around her perennial work-in-progress , `` Philosophy for Women . ''

The company said that as part of its agreement with the EPA , it `` made certain voluntary undertakings with respect to intercorporate transactions entered into after the reorganization . '' 
The company , which issued a statement on the agreement late Friday , said that $ 1 million of the payment was previously provided for in its financial statements and that $ 500,000 will be recognized in its 1989 third-quarter statement . 
The agreement and consent decree are subject to court approval , the company said . 
The company 's net worth can not fall below $ 185 million after the dividends are issued . 
`` The terms of that agreement only become effective the date of Gulf 's reorganization , which we anticipate will occur sometime in early 1990 , '' said Lawrence R. Mehl , Gulf 's general counsel . 
Gulf 's net worth after those transaction must be at least $ 150 million . 
`` This is a reaction to artificial LBO valuations , rather than to any fundamentals , '' said John Young , chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co. , whose shares dropped $ 3.125 to $ 48.125 . 
`` People wish the government would do something about leveraged buy-outs , do something about takeovers , do something about Donald Trump , '' said Rand Araskog , chairman of ITT Corp. , whose stock dropped $ 3.375 .

Asked whether Friday 's action could help him avoid being Trumped by the New York real estate magnate , Mr. Crandall smiled broadly and said : `` No comment . '' 
Of the 19 economists who worked on the Business Council forecast , only two projected periods of decline in the nation 's output over the next two years , and in `` both instances the declines are too modest to warrant the phrase recession , '' said Lewis Preston , chairman of J.P. Morgan & Co. and vice chairman of the Business Council . 
Retail real estate brokers say tenants are reluctant to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy , turmoil in their own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom . 
There are about 2,000 stores for rent , up from a more typical range of 1,200 to 1,500 . 
`` This further confuses retailers , '' she says . 
`` They wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down ? 
Is this the wrong time to open a store ? 
Who is going to be in the space next door ? '' 
That follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months , after Manhattan rents had run up rapidly since 1986 . 
`` As businesses contract or depart , the number of employees who might use retail services shrinks , '' says Edward A. Friedman , senior vice president of Helmsley Spear Inc . 
Hardest hit are what he calls `` secondary '' sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents . 
In these locations , Mr. Friedman says , `` Retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined . '' 
Weakness in the restaurant industry , which is leaving retail space vacant , exacerbates the problem for landlords . 
Hooker Corp. , parent of Bonwit Teller and B. Altman 's , is mired in bankruptcy proceedings and Bloomingdale 's is for sale by its owner , Campeau Corp . 
New York retail rents still run well above the going rate in other U.S. cities . 
Madison and Fifth Avenues and East 57th Street can command rents of up to $ 500 a square foot , and $ 250 is not uncommon . 
The thriving 34th Street area offers rents of about $ 100 a square foot , as do up-and-coming locations along lower Fifth Avenue .

This role reversal holds true , as well , for his three liberal and moderate allies , Justices Thurgood Marshall , Harry Blackmun and John Stevens . 
Justices Brennan and Stevens appear philosophical about it ; Justices Marshall and Blackmun appear fighting mad . 
; Justices Marshall and Blackmun appear fighting mad . 
In the seven Supreme Court terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967 , the height of the Warren Court 's power , Justice Brennan cast only 25 dissenting votes in 555 cases decided by the court . 
Last term alone he cast 52 dissenting votes in 133 decisions , with the contentious flag-burning ruling as his only big victory . 
`` Each time the court revisits an issue , the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result , '' he said . 
He has said that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt , a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent dissenter from the Warren Court 's opinions . 
`` We could sweep it under the rug and hide it , but I 'm not going to do it , '' he said in a speech last month . 
Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe says there is a `` generation-skipping '' flavor to current dissents . 
The dissenters in the Warren Court , he says , appeared to be writing for the short-term , suggesting that the court 's direction might change soon . `` Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future , '' he says .

`` The dissenters of the Warren Court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited , '' says Prof. A.E. Dick Howard of the University of Virginia Law School , `` but the dissenters today are defending a legacy that they created . 
A Canadian bank bought another thrift , in the first RTC transaction with a foreign bank . 
These `` clean-bank '' transactions leave the bulk of bad assets , mostly real estate , with the government , to be sold later . 
After that , the buyers may repudiate the rates paid by the former thrifts . 
`` These thrifts are beached whales , '' said Bert Ely , an industry consultant based in Alexandria , Va .

; cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000 , to four million ; and increase the cost of its annual subscription rate by about $ 4 to $ 55 . 
In recent years , Reader 's Digest , New York Times Co. 's McCall 's , and most recently News Corp. 's TV Guide , have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers . 
`` Giveaways just give people the wrong image , '' said Mr. Heinemann . 
`` That perception takes the focus off the magazine . '' 
`` What we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and do n't really read it , '' said Mr. Heinemann . 
`` We are trying to create quality and involvement . '' 
`` It 's terrific for advertisers to know the reader will be paying more , '' said Michael Drexler , national media director at Bozell Inc. ad agency . 
`` A few drops in circulation are of no consequence . 
It 's not a show of weakness ; they are improving the quality of circulation while insuring their profits . ''

`` The question is how much are we getting from each reader , '' said Mr. Heinemann . 
`` They said , ` follow CNN , ' '' he told reporters . 
It is bigger , faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks . 
Its niche as the `` network of record '' during major crises draws elite audiences around the world . 
Although viewership soars when big news breaks , it ebbs during periods of calm . 
CNN executives worry that the network 's punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and wo n't keep viewers coming back as the alternatives multiply for news and information on cable-TV . 
`` You ca n't live on that . '' 
Tonight , to kick off the effort , CNN will premiere its first prime-time newscast in years , an hourlong show at 6 p.m . Eastern time to air head-to-head against the network newscasts . 
To distinguish itself , CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program . 
It is paying higher salaries -- after years of scrimping -- to lure and keep experienced staffers . 
Networks , like other consumer products , develop images in peoples ' minds that are n't easy to change . 
Already , CNN is facing stronger competition from Financial News Network Inc. and General Electric Co. 's Consumer News and Business Channel , both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future . 
Its watchers are , on the whole , a disloyal group of channel-zapping `` grazers '' and news junkies , who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN , according to audience research . 
That 's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks . 
The brief attention viewers give CNN could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to cable-TV channels . 
It focused on building up its news bureaus around the world , so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks . 
It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called `` Daybreak , '' `` Daywatch , '' `` Newsday , '' and `` Newsnight , '' but the shows varied little in content , personality or look . 
`` Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity , '' says Paul Amos , CNN executive vice president for programming . 
`` I find it hard to conceive of people switching over to CNN for what , at least in the public 's mind , is the same news , '' says Reuven Frank , the former two-time president of NBC News and creator of the Huntley-Brinkley Report . 
In August , the network hired award-winning producer Pamela Hill , the former head of news specials at ABC . 
CNN executives hope the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its `` branded '' programs , in the way `` 60 Minutes '' did so well for CBS . 
`` They 've never shown any inclination to spend money on production , '' says Michael Mosettig , a senior producer with MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour , who notes that CNN is indispensable to his job . 
CNN recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15 % , but they 're still drastically underpaid compared with the networks . 
; they 're on top of everything . 
They market cable-TV on the very grazing opportunities CNN seeks to discourage . 
`` We would obviously be upset if those kinds of services evolved into more general-interest , long-format programming , '' says Robert Stengel , senior vice president , programming , of Continental Cablevision Inc. , which holds a 2 % stake in Turner Broadcasting .

The franchisees , owners or operators of 1,000 of the 1,900 franchised Arby 's in the U.S. , said : `` We have concluded that continued control of Arby 's by Victor Posner is totally unacceptable to us , because it is extremely likely to cause irreparable damage to the Arby 's system . 
We support all efforts to remove Victor Posner from control of Arby 's Inc. and the Arby 's system . '' 
Analysts immediately viewed the price data , the grimmest inflation news in months , as evidence that the Federal Reserve was unlikely to allow interest rates to fall as many investors had hoped . 
That rise came on top of a 0.7 % gain in August , and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy . 
`` I would say this is not bad news ; this is a blip , '' he said . 
; this is a blip , '' he said . 
`` The core rate is not really out of line . '' 
While far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year , that is still a steeper rise than the 4.0 % increase for all of 1988 . 
Some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead , leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain . 
`` I think the resurgence -LCB- in inflation -RCB- is going to continue for a few months , '' said John Mueller , chief economist at Bell Mueller Cannon , a Washington economic forecasting firm . 
He predicted that inflation will moderate next year , saying that credit conditions are fairly tight world-wide . 
`` If you examine the data carefully , the increase is concentrated in energy and motor vehicle prices , rather than being a broad-based advance in the prices of consumer and industrial goods , '' he explained . 
Many analysts said the September increase was a one-time event , coming as dealers introduced their 1990 models . 
Although all the price data were adjusted for normal seasonal fluctuations , car prices rose beyond the customary autumn increase . 
Food prices declined 0.6 % , after climbing 0.3 % in August .

Approximately 85 % of the total consisted of nonperforming commercial real estate assets . 
That action , CityFed said , will result in a charge against third-quarter results of approximately $ 30 million . 
He said the thrift will try to get regulators to reverse the decision . 
In the same month , the Office of Thrift Supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track . 
Since April , it has pared its high-yield bond holdings to about $ 890 million from $ 1.35 billion . 
Mr. Paul said only about $ 150 million of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission . 
The remainder , he said , are commercial loan participations , or private placements , that are n't filed with the SEC and do n't have a ready market . 
The Office of Thrift Supervision has been hounding CenTrust to provide current market values for its holdings , but CenTrust has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market . 
The legislation requires thrifts to divest themselves of junk bonds in the new , somber regulatory climate . 
Most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction , which was announced in July , long before now . 
Many interpret the delay as an indication that regulators are skeptical about the proposal . 
It said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $ 82 million , or about 1.2 % of assets , from a negative $ 33 million as of Sept. 30 , thus bringing CenTrust close to regulatory standards . 
So far , the French have failed to win enough broad-based support to prevail . 
While there are some popular action and drama series , few boast the high culture and classy production values one might expect . 
More European air time is filled with low-budget game shows , variety hours , movies and talk shows , many of which are authorized knock-offs of their American counterparts . 
A Flemish game show has as its host a Belgian pretending to be Italian . 
One of Italy 's favorite shows , `` Fantastico , '' a tepid variety show , is so popular that viewers clamored to buy a chocolate product , `` Cacao Fantastico , '' whose praises were sung each week by dancing showgirls -- even though the product did n't exist . 
European programs usually target only their own local audience , and often only a small portion of that . 
Mega-hits in Germany or Italy rarely make it even to France or Great Britain , and almost never show up on U.S. screens . 
One annual co-production , the three-hour-long `` Eurovision Song Contest , '' featuring soft-rock songs from each of 20 European countries , has been described as the world 's most boring TV show . 
Another , `` Jeux Sans Frontieres , '' where villagers from assorted European countries make fools of themselves performing pointless tasks , is a hit in France . 
A U.S.-made imitation under the title `` Almost Anything Goes '' flopped fast . 
The cream of the British crop , the literary dramas that are shown on U.S. public television as `` Masterpiece Theater , '' make up a relatively small part of British air time . 
Most British programming is more of an acquired taste . 
A French knock-off of `` Dallas , '' called `` Chateauvallon '' and set in a French vineyard , had a good run in France , which ended after the female lead was injured in a real-life auto accident . 
`` Schwarzwaldklinik , '' -LRB- Black Forest Clinic -RRB- , a kind of German `` St . Elsewhere '' set in a health spa , is popular in Germany , and has spread into France . 
It was front-page news in Italy earlier this year when the fictional inspector was gunned down in the series . 
Spain 's most popular mini-series this year was `` Juncal , '' the story of an aging bullfighter . 
`` Given a choice , everybody will watch a home-produced show . '' 
`` We 've basically got to start from scratch , to train writers and producers to make shows that other people will want to see , '' concedes Colin Young , head of Britain 's National Film Theatre School . 
Since production costs were guaranteed , it did n't matter that a program could n't be sold abroad or put into syndication , as most American programs are . 
Just last week , Greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time ; Spain earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels . 
The result is a new and huge appetite for programming . 
The financially struggling station offers programs obviously made available cheaply from its boss 's other ventures . 
In a Madrid hotel room recently , a viewer caught the end of a badly acted series about a fishing boat on Australia 's Great Barrier Reef , only to be urged by the British announcer to `` stay tuned for the further adventures of Skippy the Kangaroo . '' 
The companies hope for a final agreement by year-end . 
In recent months , a string of cross-border mergers and joint ventures have reshaped the once-balkanized world of European arms manufacture . 
Just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy Ferranti International Signal PLC , a smaller British defense contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a U.S. unit . 
GEC plans first to study Ferranti 's financial accounts , which auditors recently said included # 215 million in fictitious contracts at a U.S. unit , International Signal & Control Group , with which Ferranti merged last year . 
; Ferranti is GEC 's main competitor on several key defense-electronics contracts , and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country 's defense industry . 
`` We have nothing to say about this affair , which does n't concern us , '' a Matra official said Sunday . 
For both Thomson and British Aerospace , earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries ; and Middle East sales , a traditional mainstay for both companies ' exports , have been hurt by five years of weak oil prices . 
Thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans . 
The European defense industry is consolidating ; for instance , West Germany 's Siemens AG recently joined GEC in a takeover of Britain 's Plessey Co. , and Daimler-Benz agreed to buy Messerschmitt-Boelkow Blohm G.m.b . H . 
S.A. ; to better compete , Thomson officials say , they need a partnership . 
Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989 's first half , about 1 % below the 1988 level . 
Mr. Watkins said volume on Interprovincial 's system is down about 2 % since January and is expected to fall further , making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s . 
The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30 % from a year ago , and the number of completed oil wells is `` down more than that , due to the increasing focus on gas exploration , '' said Robert Feick , manager of crude oil with Calgary 's Independent Petroleum Association of Canada , an industry group . 
That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude , behind Saudi Arabia , Nigeria and Mexico . 
The system currently has a capacity of 1.55 million barrels a day . 
The service-center business was hurt by reduced margins and start-up costs associated with its Joseph T. Ryerson & Son unit . 
The announcement caused the company 's stock to surge $ 6.50 to close at $ 75.50 a share . 
`` It 's hard to know what to expect at this point , '' said Peter Rogers , an analyst at Robertson Stephens & Co . 
`` The industry defies characterization . '' 
This month , however , Businessland warned investors that results for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 had n't met expectations . In July , the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from Apple and IBM had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended June 30 to $ 7.4 million , or 23 cents a share . 
The company said it expects earnings of 14 to 17 cents a share , down from 25 cents a share in the year-earlier period . 
In computer publishing , a battle over typefaces is hurting Adobe Systems Inc. , which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays . 
Until recently , Adobe had a lock on the market for image software , but last month Apple , Adobe 's biggest customer , and Microsoft rebelled . 
The company is beginning to ship a new software program that 's being heralded as a boon for owners of low-end printers sold by Apple . 
`` It creates uncertainty and usually slows down sales , '' said Russ Crabs , an analyst at Soundview Financial Group . 
In personal computers , Apple , Compaq and IBM are expected to tighten their hold on their business . At the same time , second-tier firms will continue to lose ground . 
`` Wyse has done well establishing a distribution business , but they have n't delivered products that sell , '' said Kimball Brown , an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities . 
Mr. Brown estimates Wyse , whose terminals business is strong , will report a loss of 12 cents a share for its quarter ended Sept . 
Ever-more powerful desk-top computers , designed with one or more microprocessors as their `` brains , '' are expected to increasingly take on functions carried out by more expensive minicomputers and mainframes . 
Mr. Benton expects Compaq to unveil a family of high-end personal computers later this year that are powerful enough to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of desk-top machines . 
So are Indiana , Ohio and Michigan . 
The population of all four states is on the upswing , according to new Census Bureau estimates , following declines throughout the early 1980s . 
Six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since 1980 -- Illinois , Kansas , Minnesota , Missouri , South Dakota and Wisconsin . 
Seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980 , including New York , which lost 4 % of its population during the 1970s . 
Seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population -- West Virginia , Mississippi , Louisiana , Oklahoma , Montana , Wyoming and Alaska . 
That share has remained at about 24 % since 1970 . 
What has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives , such as children . 
In 1988 , 10 % of those aged 65 to 74 lived with relatives other than spouses , down from 15 % in 1970 . 
Only 17 % of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouses in 1988 , down from 26 % in 1970 . 
Two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs , while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families . 
Being successful in careers and spending the money they make are top priorities for this group . 
Average household income for the sample was $ 194,000 , and average net assets were reported as $ 775,000 . 
Although they represent only 2 % of the population , they control nearly one-third of discretionary income . 
Twenty percent do n't even feel they are financially well off . 
About 40 % do n't feel they 're more able than others . 
While twothirds feel some guilt about being affluent , only 25 % give $ 2,500 or more to charity each year . 
The American Bankers Association says that women make up 47 % of officials and managers in the top 50 banks , up from 33 % in 1978 . The share of minorities in those positions has risen to 16 % from 12 % ... . 
The share of minorities in those positions has risen to 16 % from 12 % ... . 
The amount of income divvied up for each man , woman and child was $ 16,489 in 1988 , up 6.6 % from $ 15,472 in 1987 . 
About 54 % are women , and 44 % are part-time students . 
Trouble with a capital T and that rhymes with P and that stands for pool . 
`` Obviously they 're not in touch with what 's going on , '' says Tom Manske , vice president of the National Pocket Billiards Association . 
Pool is hot in New York and Chicago , he insists , where `` upscale , suit-and-tie places '' are adding tables . 
With today 's tougher drunk driving laws , he adds , `` people do n't want to just sit around and drink . '' 
At the lounge , manager Elizabeth Dyer wo n't admit patrons in jeans , T-shirts or tennis shoes . 
Introducing pool , argued Councilwoman Riley Reinker , would be `` dangerous . 
It would open a can of worms . '' 
After its previous mayor committed suicide last year , an investigation disclosed that town officials regularly voted on their own projects , gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into the town 's coffers for trips and retreats . 
Now comes the pool flap . 
`` I thought this was all taken care of in ` The Music Man . 
; `` Mainland haole '' is . 
Sorry , the show does not even have the one redeeming quality of genuine local color . 
A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New York City . 
Not only is Mr. Mason the star of `` Chicken Soup , '' he 's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to `` Duck Soup , '' and he 's currently a man in hot water . 
Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks , so they support black candidates uncritically . 
He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination , so they , too , support black candidates uncritically . 
He said that Jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice versa . 
As a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the Borscht Belt , live television and the nightclub circuit , Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular . 
He said Jews were `` sick with complexes '' ; and he called David Dinkins , Mr. Giuliani 's black opponent , `` a fancy shvartze with a mustache . '' 
People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck . '' 
Why constructive ? 
: Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict . 
That 's why it 's dangerous to have well-intentioned thought police , on college campuses and elsewhere , taboo all critical mention of group differences . 
The question is , if group conflicts still exist -LRB- as undeniably they do -RRB- , and if Mr. Mason 's type of ethnic humor is passe , then what other means do we have for letting off steam ? 
It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in `` Cheers '' ; children vs. adults in `` The Cosby Show . '' 
At least , they both speak with strong accents , as do Jackie and Maddie . 
It could n't be more obvious that `` Chicken Soup '' is being made from an old recipe . 
So far , the bubbles have been few and far between . 
Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms , ever since the didactic days of Norman Lear , to preach about social issues . 
To some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them . 
Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona . 
The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end -LRB- and occasionally in the middle -RRB- , when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself . 
That issue , like racial tensions in New York City , will have to cool down , not heat up , before it can simmer .

Lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax breaks and spending increases . 
`` We do n't need this as a way to get capital gains , '' he said . 
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- said he was `` confident '' that any House-Senate agreement on the deficit-reduction legislation would n't include a capital-gains tax cut . 
Because the legislation has n't been completed , President Bush has until midnight tonight to enact across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law . 
The House appears reluctant to join the senators . 
A key is whether House Republicans are willing to acquiesce to their Senate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions . 
These include a child-care initiative and extensions of soon-to-expire tax breaks for low-income housing and research-and-development expenditures . 
To the detriment of many low-income people , efforts to boost Medicaid funding , especially in rural areas , also were stricken . 
Things had just gone too far . '' 
It worked , others said , because there were no exceptions : all revenue-losing provisions were stricken . 
It no longer includes a plan that would have repealed what remains of the completed-contract method of accounting , which is used by military contractors to reduce their tax burden . 
A provision that would have made the Social Security Administration an independent agency was excised . 
Mr. Mitchell 's relations with Budget Director Darman , who pushed for a capital-gains cut to be added to the measure , have been strained since Mr. Darman chose to bypass the Maine Democrat and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal 1989 supplemental spending bill . 
The revenue-raising provisions , which affect mostly corporations , would : -- Prevent companies that have made leveraged buy-outs from getting federal tax refunds resulting from losses caused by interest payments on debt issued to finance the buy-outs , effective Aug. 2 , 1989 . -- Require mutual funds to include in their taxable income dividends paid to them on the date that the dividends are declared rather than received , effective the day after the tax bill is enacted . -- Close a loophole regarding employee stock ownership plans , effective June 6 , 1989 , that has been exploited by investment bankers in corporate takeovers . The measure repeals a 50 % exclusion given to banks on the interest from loans used to acquire securities for an ESOP , if the ESOP owns less than 30 % of the employer 's stock . -- Curb junk bonds by ending tax benefits for certain securities , such as zero-coupon bonds , that postpone cash interest payments . -- Raise $ 851 million by suspending for one year an automatic reduction in airport and airway taxes . -- Speed up the collection of the payroll tax from large companies , effective August 1990 . -- Impose a tax on ozone-depleting chemicals , such as those used in air conditioners and in Styrofoam , beginning at $ 1.10 a pound starting next year . -- Withhold income taxes from the paychecks of certain farm workers currently exempt from withholding . -- Change the collection of gasoline excise taxes to weekly from semimonthly , effective next year . -- Restrict the ability of real estate owners to escape taxes by swapping one piece of property for another instead of selling it for cash . -- Increase to $ 6 a person from $ 3 the international air-passenger departure tax , and impose a $ 3-a-person tax on international departures by commercial ships .

The agency said it reduced its rating on the thrift 's subordinated debt to B-2 from Ba-2 and will keep the debt under review for possible further downgrade . 
New federal legislation requires that all thrifts divest themselves of such speculative securities over a period of years . 
The rating concern said Franklin 's `` troubled diversification record in the securities business '' was one reason for the downgrade , citing the troubles at its L.F. Rothschild subsidiary and the possible sale of other subsidiaries . 
`` They perhaps had concern that we were getting out of all these , '' said Franklin President Duane H. Hall . 
`` I think it was a little premature on their part . 
`` Well , in some ways it is different , but technically it is just the same .

In 1987 , such selling contributed to a snowball effect . 
`` We will probably have a year-end rally , and then go down again . 
Sort of a two-step bear market . '' 
`` That would be a normal bear market , '' he says . 
`` I guess that 's my forecast . '' 
I do n't think that 's the case at all , '' says Mr. Cooperman , a partner at Goldman , Sachs & Co. and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management . 
`` I expect the market to open weaker Monday , but then it should find some stability . '' 
Unlike 1987 , interest rates have been falling this year . 
Unlike 1987 , the dollar has been strong . 
`` If I had come into Friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios , I would not do any buying . 
We 're going to look for some of the better-known companies that got clocked '' Friday . 
`` The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity . 
This has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable . '' 
`` There is more resiliency in the economy at large than we commonly suppose , '' he says . 
`` It takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the Thirties -- much as the financial community and the government may try . '' 
Examples are `` Ford looking at Jaguar , BellSouth looking at LIN Broadcasting . '' 
These sorts of takeovers do n't require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them , so Mr. Gabelli figures they will continue . 
He thinks another crash is `` unlikely , '' and says he was `` nibbling at '' selected stocks during Friday 's plunge . 
`` Friday you could n't sell dollars , '' he says . 
Dealers `` would give you a quote , but then refuse to make the trade . '' 
He recommends that investors sell takeover-related stocks , but hang on to some other stocks -- especially utilities , which often do well during periods of economic weakness . 
Queens newsletter writer Francis X. Curzio actually did it : He stated in writing in September 1987 that the Dow Jones Industrial Average was likely to decline about 500 points the following month . 
If it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks , he says , `` That could quiet things down . '' If not , `` We could go to 2200 very soon . ''

`` T-bills probably are the right place to be , '' he says . 
As I watched him on C-Span , I heard him speak those lovely words about the Bill of Rights , which he quotes from the transcript of the hearings . 
He used about 56 words defending the witnesses ' constitutional rights . 
He sandwiched his praise of constitutional meat between large loaves of bilious commentary . 
As your editorial rightly pointed out , Samuel Pierce , former HUD secretary , and Lance Wilson , Mr. Pierce 's former aide , `` are currently being held up to scorn for taking the Fifth Amendment . 
'' That certainly is not the supposed `` distorted reading '' indicated by Mr. Lantos . 
My colleagues and I fully realize we are not a court ... etc . '' 
Right now they 're pursuing evidence . 
That 's not a bad way to proceed , just somewhat different from standard American practice . 
No doubt that 's partially true . 
Everything that Mr. Lantos says in his letter is partially true . 
He 's right about his subcommittee 's responsibilities when it comes to obtaining information from prior HUD officials . 
No , Mr. Lantos 's complaints simply wo n't wash . 
it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense . 
Individuals can always have their hands slapped . 
It 's when such slapping does n't occur that we 've got trouble . 
The last time I saw a similar congressional hearing was when `` Tail Gunner Joe '' McCarthy did his work . 
This privilege against self-incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify . 
He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution . 
Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . 
Absent the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify . 
The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime . 
Drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the Fifth Amendment shield against self-incrimination . 
In a similar vein , he adds that the anniversary of the 1987 crash and Saturday 's full moon could have played a part , too , in Friday 's market activity . 
`` It was -LCB- like -RCB- the Friday before Black Monday '' two years ago . 
Ten points of the drop occurred during the last 45 minutes of trading . 
Mr. King of Robinson-Humphrey and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability to handle the volume of calls , rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades . 
There were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots . 
It was n't intentional , we were all busy . '' 
Everybody was trying to do the same thing at the same time . '' 
On days like Friday , that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to . 
When selling is so frenzied , prices fall steeply and fast . 
Two years ago , faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories , market makers themselves began dumping shares , exacerbating the slide in OTC stock prices . 
`` Everyone was hitting everyone else 's bid , '' he said . 
`` Two years ago we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big culprit . I do n't know of anyone carrying big inventories now , '' said Mr. King of Robinson-Humphrey . 
I do n't know of anyone carrying big inventories now , '' said Mr. King of Robinson-Humphrey . 
It helped that his inventory is a third smaller now than it was two years ago , he said . 
Nasdaq 's Small Order Execution System `` worked beautifully , '' as did the automated system for larger trades , according to Mr. Hardiman . 
Because Nasdaq 's trading volume has n't returned to pre-crash levels , traders and OTC market officials hope the damage wo n't be permanent . 
`` We were just starting to get the public 's confidence back , '' lamented Mr. Mullins of Dean Witter . 
It wo n't take much more to `` scare the hell out of retail investors , '' he says . 
Institutional investors , which had been selling stock throughout last week to lock in handsome gains made through the third quarter , were calmer . 
`` If they could n't sell , some of them put the shares back on the shelf . '' 
The Nasdaq 100 Index of the largest nonfinancial issues , including the big OTC technology issues , tumbled 4.2 % , or 19.76 , to 449.33 .

`` I waited to make sure all the program trades had kicked through , '' he said . Then he jumped into the market : `` I spent $ 30 million in the last half-hour . '' 
`` I was buying at the close -LRB- Friday -RRB- and I 'll be buying again because I know we 're getting good value , '' said Frederick A. Moran , president of Moran Asset Management Inc. , Greenwich , Conn . 
`` There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash . '' 
Most often , they do just that , because stocks have proved to be the best-performing long-term investment , attracting about $ 1 trillion from pension funds alone . 
`` Those that pulled out -LRB- of stocks -RRB- regretted it , '' he said , `` so I doubt you 'll see any significant changes '' in institutional portfolios as a result of Friday 's decline . 
Even Friday 's slump leaves investors ahead more than 20 % , well above the annual average for stocks over several decades . 
It can happen before you can turn around . '' 
He said he discerns many parallels with 1987 , including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading . 
`` The only thing you do n't have , '' he said , `` is the ` portfolio insurance ' phenomenon overlaid on the rest . '' 
In its severest test , the $ 60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash did n't work , as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected . 
Neil Weisman , whose New York-based Chilmark Capital Partners had converted 85 % of its $ 220 million investment pool to cash in recent months , said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands . 
`` I think it will be a rigor mortis rally , '' he said . 
Especially gleeful were the short sellers , who have been pounded by this year 's market climb . 
`` We 're ahead for the year because of Friday , '' said the firm 's Kurt Feshbach . 
`` We 're not making a killing , but we had a good day . 
Bolar has denied that it switched the brand-name product for its own in such testing . 
ASKO says the Dutch-based international food retailer had n't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of ASKO and other shareholders . 
He termed ASKO 's legal actions as `` unproductive '' to international cooperation among European retailers . 
`` I 'd like to see that initiative , and I have n't . 
There is n't a big shot , an agenda . '' 
The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit-cutting bill . 
`` We simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices , '' House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- said yesterday on NBC News 's `` Meet the Press . '' 
The administration has been trying to push the dollar lower ; the Fed has been resisting . 
; the Fed has been resisting . 
`` One of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary warfare between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board , '' said Lawrence Kudlow , a Bear , Stearns & Co. economist , on ABC 's `` This Week . '' 
Some analysts say uncertainty about Washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through -- the event that triggered the market drop . 
Then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold . The Treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy , although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the Federal Reserve . And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee rather than the Transportation Department -- were making markets nervous . 
The Treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy , although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the Federal Reserve . 
Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday 's drop , by itself , is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring 's gimmick-ridden plan , which still is n't fully implemented . 
`` Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of 1929 , that we were looking at a recession , '' Rep. Panetta said yesterday in an interview . `` That did not happen . 
`` That did not happen . 
They learned they could survive it without much problem . '' 
`` There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people -- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , '' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- . 
At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it . 
Asked if the administration agreed , he curtly replied : `` The adminstration will have to speak for itself . '' 
Rep. Panetta said that OMB 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : `` We 're getting very close to the margins here . '' 
Before the sun had set on Friday , Richard Rahn , the supply-side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains . 
`` Investors , who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell , were spooked , '' he said .

`` Oh , I bet it 'll be up 50 points on Monday , '' said Lucy Crump , a 78-year-old retired housewife in Lexington , Ky . 
Mrs. Crump said her Ashwood Investment Club 's portfolio lost about one-third of its value following the Black Monday crash , `` but no one got discouraged , and we gained that back -- and more . '' 
`` We hope to take advantage of it , '' said John Snyder , a member of a Los Angeles investors ' club . 
He has four stocks in mind to buy if the prices drop to the level he wants . 
There 's no question that there 's a general distaste for leverage among lenders . 
`` I have this feeling that it 's built on sand , '' she says , that the market rises `` but there 's no foundation to it . ''

When it comes to money : Once bitten , 2,000 times shy . 
One manufacturer already has produced a clipboard-sized computer called a notepad , and two others have introduced even smaller `` palmtops . '' 
Analysts say they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market -- and they 're priced aggressively at $ 2,400 to $ 5,000 . 
All of this comes in a machine that weighs only six pounds and fits comfortably into most briefcases . 
One analyst , noting that most such machines are about two inches thick , takes exception to the name . 
`` This is n't quite a notebook -- I call it a phonebook , '' he says . 
Instead of a keyboard , it features a writing surface , an electronic pen and the ability to `` read '' block printing . 
At 4 1\/2 pounds , it may be too ambitiously named , but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts froth . 
Atari Corp. 's Portfolio , introduced in Europe two months ago and in the U.S. in early September , weighs less than a pound , costs a mere $ 400 and runs on three AA batteries , yet has the power to run some spreadsheets and word processing programs . 
The market is so new , nobody knows yet how big it can be . 
`` I 've had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is , '' says Tom Humphries , director of marketing for GRiD . 
`` Whether it 's $ 5 billion or $ 3.5 billion , it does n't matter . 
It 's huge . '' 
Laptops -- generally anything under 15 pounds -- have become the fastest-growing personal computer segment , with sales doubling this year . 
Making computers smaller often means sacrificing memory . 
Both palmtops are dismissed by notebook makers , who argue that they 're too small -- a problem Poquet also encountered in focus groups , admits Gerry Purdy , director of marketing . 
Poquet , trying to avoid the `` gadget '' label , responded with the tag line , `` The Poquet PC -- a Very Big Computer . '' 
Toward that end , experts say the real battle will take place between center-stage players like Toshiba , Zenith and now Compaq . 
Rod Canion , Compaq 's president and chief executive officer , notes pointedly that Zenith 's $ 2,000 MinisPort uses an `` unconventional '' two-inch floppy disk , whereas Compaq 's new machines use the more common 3 1\/2-inch disk . 
John P. Frank , president of Zenith Data Systems , simply shrugs off such criticism , noting that 3 1\/2-inch floppies were also `` unconventional '' when they first replaced five-inch disks . 
`` We do n't look at it as not being a standard , we look at it as a new standard , '' he argues . 
`` I ca n't imagine that you 'll talk to anyone who wo n't tell you this is dynamite for Compaq and a stopper for everyone else , '' says Gene Talsky , president of Professional Marketing Management Inc . 
Adds Bill Lempesis , senior industry analyst for DataQuest , a high-technology market research firm : `` We basically think that these are very hot products . 
The problem Compaq is going to have is that they wo n't be able to make enough of them . '' 
A third model , marketed in Japan , may hit the U.S. by the end of the first quarter of 1990 , but by then , analysts say , Compaq will have established itself as one of three major players . 
Other major issues hitting highs included American Telephone & Telegraph Co. , Westinghouse Electric Corp. , Exxon Corp. and Cigna Corp. , the big insurer . 
These included International Business Machines Corp. , which during Friday 's session traded below $ 100 a share for the first time since June 1984 . 
IBM closed at $ 102 , down $ 5.625 .

The stock market 's swoon may turn out to be good news for the economy . 
It is forcing the Federal Reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously irrepressible dollar . 
The resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could reinvigorate American business -- indeed , the entire economy . 
After all , until a few years ago , the stock market was viewed as a barometer of the national economy . 
When it went down , by all tradition , the economy followed . 
The 1987 crash was `` a false alarm however you view it , '' says University of Chicago economist Victor Zarnowitz . 
Its spasms ca n't be traced to fundamental business conditions , nor do they appear to presage major shifts in the economy . 
`` The market today has a life of its own , '' John Akers , chairman of International Business Machines Corp. , said Saturday . 
Sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth , damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the U.S. now relies for financial sustenance . 
The financial-services industry was battered by the 1987 crash . 
Growth is slower . 
Profits are softer . 
Debt burdens are heavier . 
The Fed , which until Friday had been resisting moves to ease credit , is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets . 
Fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies . 
Treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar 's strength was out of whack with economic fundamentals , threatening to extinguish the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for several years . 
The market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the Treasury was right about the overpriced dollar . 
That was n't the case in 1987 , when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse , producing panic among foreign investors and diminishing the flow of foreign capital to the U.S. . 
In the third quarter of 1987 , the economy spurted at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 5.3 % . The consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish 2.3 % in the third quarter of 1989 , which ended two weeks ago .
