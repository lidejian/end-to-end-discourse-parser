Some `` circuit breakers '' installed after the October 1987 crash failed their first test , traders say , unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures . 
Some `` circuit breakers '' installed after the October 1987 crash failed their first test , traders say , unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures . The 49 stock specialist firms on the Big Board floor -- the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the 1987 crash -- once again could n't handle the selling pressure . Big investment banks refused to step up to the plate to support the beleaguered floor traders by buying big blocks of stock , traders say . 
The finger-pointing has already begun . 
`` The equity market was illiquid . 
Countered James Maguire , chairman of specialists Henderson Brothers Inc. : `` It is easy to say the specialist is n't doing his job . 
Then in a lightning plunge , the Dow Jones industrials in barely an hour surrendered about a third of their gains this year , chalking up a 190.58-point , or 6.9 % , loss on the day in gargantuan trading volume . 
Final-hour trading accelerated to 108.1 million shares , a record for the Big Board . 
At the end of the day , 251.2 million shares were traded . 
In percentage terms , however , the Dow 's dive was the 12th-worst ever and the sharpest since the market fell 156.83 , or 8 % , a week after Black Monday . 
Shares of UAL , the parent of United Airlines , were extremely active all day Friday , reacting to news and rumors about the proposed $ 6.79 billion buy-out of the airline by an employee-management group . 
At 2:43 p.m. EDT , came the sickening news : The Big Board was halting trading in UAL , `` pending news . '' 
On the exchange floor , `` as soon as UAL stopped trading , we braced for a panic , '' said one top floor trader . 
The market crumbled . 
But as panic spread , speculators began to sell blue-chip stocks such as Philip Morris and International Business Machines to offset their losses . 
Selling snowballed because of waves of automatic `` stop-loss '' orders , which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels . 
Now , at 3:07 , one of the market 's post-crash `` reforms '' took hold as the S&P 500 futures contract had plunged 12 points , equivalent to around a 100-point drop in the Dow industrials . 
As a result , the link between the futures and stock markets ripped apart . 
Without the guidepost of stock-index futures -- the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed -- many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the Big Board . 
The futures halt was even assailed by Big Board floor traders . 
`` When the airline information came through , it cracked every model we had for the marketplace , '' said a managing director at one of the largest program-trading firms . 
But stocks kept falling . 
The Dow industrials were down 55 points at 3 p.m. before the futures-trading halt . 
Big Board Chairman John J. Phelan said yesterday the circuit breaker `` worked well mechanically . 
At about 3:30 p.m. EDT , S&P futures resumed trading , and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line . 
At about 3:45 , the S&P market careened to still another limit , of 30 points down , and trading was locked again . 
`` I have a hunch that this particular decline today is something ` more ado about less . ' 
At Merrill Lynch & Co. , the nation 's biggest brokerage firm , a news release was prepared headlined `` Merrill Lynch Comments on Market Drop . '' 
And I think a lot of people will harp on program trading . 
As the Dow average ground to its final 190.58 loss Friday , the S&P pit stayed locked at its 30-point trading limit . 
While Friday 's debacle involved mainly professional traders rather than investors , it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning , traders said . 
Stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself . 
But the exchange will `` look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks . 
But specialists complain privately that just as in the 1987 crash , the `` upstairs '' firms -- big investment banks that support the market by trading big blocks of stock -- stayed on the sidelines during Friday 's blood-letting .

Hooker 's philosophy was to build and sell . 
L.J. Hooker , based in Atlanta , is operating with protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code . 
The $ 409 million bid is estimated by Mr. Simpson as representing 75 % of the value of all Hooker real-estate holdings in the U.S. . 
L.J. Hooker was a small home-building company based in Atlanta in 1979 when Mr. Simpson was hired to push it into commercial development . 
Eventually Mr. Simpson and Mr. Herscu had a falling out over the direction of the company , and Mr. Simpson said he resigned in 1988 . 
In addition , Robert Sakowitz , chief executive of the Sakowitz chain , is seeking funds to buy out the Hooker interest in his company . 
Reached in Honolulu , Mr. Shidler said that he believes the various Hooker malls can become profitable with new management . 
`` These are n't mature assets , but they have the potential to be so , '' said Mr. Shidler . 
The bills will be dated Oct. 26 and will mature Oct. 25 , 1990 . 
At Fidelity Investments , the nation 's largest fund company , telephone volume was up sharply , but it was still at just half the level of the weekend preceding Black Monday in 1987 . 
The Boston firm said stock-fund redemptions were running at less than one-third the level two years ago . 
`` Two years ago there were massive redemption levels over the weekend and a lot of fear around , '' said C. Bruce Johnstone , who runs Fidelity Investments ' $ 5 billion Equity-Income Fund . 
`` This feels more like a one-shot deal . 
The test may come today . 
Friday 's stock market sell-off came too late for many investors to act . 
Some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after Friday 's close would take place at today 's closing prices . 
But fund managers say they 're ready . 
Mario Gabelli , for instance , holds cash positions well above 20 % in several of his funds . 
Even Peter Lynch , manager of Fidelity 's $ 12.7 billion Magellan Fund , the nation 's largest stock fund , built up cash to 7 % or $ 850 million . 
As a group , stock funds held 10.2 % of assets in cash as of August , the latest figures available from the Investment Company Institute . 
But a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around , fund managers said . 
A major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since Black Monday . 
Many fund managers argue that now 's the time to buy . 
Fidelity 's Mr. Lynch , for his part , snapped up Southern Co. shares Friday after the stock got hammered . 
If the market drops further today , he said he 'll be buying blue chips such as Bristol-Myers and Kellogg . 
But most investors were seeking share prices and other information . 
Still , fund groups are n't taking any chances . 
Fidelity on Saturday opened its 54 walk-in investor centers across the country . 
In an unusual move , several funds moved to calm investors with recordings on their toll-free phone lines . 
`` We view -LCB- Friday 's -RCB- market decline as offering us a buying opportunity as long-term investors , '' a recording at Gabelli & Co. funds said over the weekend . 
Several fund managers expect a rough market this morning before prices stabilize . 
Some early selling is likely to stem from investors and portfolio managers who want to lock in this year 's fat profits . 
But she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling investors she expects the stock market wo n't decline more than 10 % to 15 % from recent highs . 
`` Half of them are really scared and want to sell , '' she said , `` but I 'm trying to talk them out of it . '' 
The backdrop to Friday 's slide was markedly different from that of the October 1987 crash , fund managers argue . 
`` From the investors ' standpoint , institutions and individuals learned a painful lesson ... by selling at the lows '' on Black Monday , said Stephen Boesel , manager of the $ 580 million T. Rowe Price Growth and Income Fund . 
Mr. Otradovec said Boeing told America West that the 757 it was supposed to get this Thursday would n't be delivered until Nov. 7 -- the day after the airline had been planning to initiate service at Houston with four daily flights , including three nonstops to Phoenix and one nonstop to Las Vegas . 
Boeing is also supposed to send to America West another 757 twin-engine aircraft as well as a 737 by year 's end . 
`` I just do n't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged walkout , '' Tom Baker , president of Machinists ' District 751 , said in an interview yesterday . 
America West , though , is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be . 
Indeed , a random check Friday did n't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations . 
Southwest Airlines has a Boeing 737-300 set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time . 
A spokesman for AMR Corp. said Boeing has assured American Airlines it will deliver a 757 on time later this month . 
No date has yet been set to get back to the bargaining table . 
The investment community , for one , has been anticipating a speedy resolution . 
Though Boeing 's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market Friday , it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders . 
`` The market has taken two views : that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very rosy for Boeing in the long term , '' said Howard Rubel , an analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc . 
Still , he said , it 's possible that the strike could last considerably longer . 
But Mr. Baker called the letter -- and the company 's offer of a 10 % wage increase over the life of the pact , plus bonuses -- `` very weak . '' 
The union is continuing to work through its expired contract , however . 
`` The projects are big . 
`` But we would n't go into them alone , '' and Canadian Utilities ' equity stake would be small , he said . 
Britain 's government plans to raise about # 20 billion -LRB- $ 31.05 billion -RRB- from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities , beginning next month . 
`` There seems to be a move around the world to deregulate the generation of electricity , '' Mr. Richardson said , and Canadian Utilities hopes to capitalize on it . 
Canadian Utilities is n't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in Britain , in anticipation of the privatization program . 
CONCORDE trans-Atlantic flights are $ 2,400 to Paris and $ 3,200 to London . 
`` There are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash . 
Typically , developers option property , and then once they get the administrative approvals , they buy it , '' said Mr. Karatz , adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind . 
By setting up the joint venture , Kaufman & Broad can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land , while avoiding the negative impacts to its own balance sheet , Mr. Karatz said . 
The timing of Quantum 's chief executive officer , John Hoyt Stookey , appeared to be nothing less than inspired , because he had just increased Quantum 's reliance on plastics . 
But now prices have nose-dived and Quantum 's profit is plummeting . 
To a degree , Quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so-called commodity plastics that pervade modern life . 
And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them . 
`` We were all wonderful heroes last year , '' says an executive at one of Quantum 's competitors . 
At Quantum , which is based in New York , the trouble is magnified by the company 's heavy dependence on plastics . 
In recent months the price of polyethylene , even more than that of other commodity plastics , has taken a dive . 
By many accounts , an early hint of a price rout in the making came at the start of this year . 
Kenneth Mitchell , director of Dow 's polyethylene business , says producers were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices spiraled up . 
One doubter is George Krug , a chemical-industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. and a bear on plastics stocks . 
Noting others ' estimates of when price increases can be sustained , he remarks , `` Some say October . 
Some say November . 
I say 1992 . '' 
A quick turnaround is crucial to Quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy . 
Quantum described the payout at the time as a way for it to share the bonanza with its holders , because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases . 
On top of everything else , Quantum confronts a disaster at its plant in Morris , Ill . 
Then a second explosion occurred . 
This human toll adds the most painful dimension yet to the sudden change in Quantum 's fortunes . 
A prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another imponderable into Quantum 's financial future . 
Not everything looks grim for Quantum . 
The plant expansion should strengthen the company 's sway in the polyethylene business , where market share is often taken through sheer capacity . 
Quantum is also tightening its grip on its one large business outside chemicals , propane marketing . 
Petrolane is the second-largest propane distributor in the U.S. . 
Still , Quantum has a crisis to get past right now . 
Some analysts speculate the weakening stock may yet attract a suitor . 
A spokesman for the New York-based food and tobacco giant , taken private earlier this year in a $ 25 billion leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. , confirmed that it is shutting down the RJR Nabisco Broadcast unit , and dismissing its 14 employees , in a move to save money . 
The broadcast group had been based in New York until a year ago , when RJR 's previous management moved it to Atlanta , the company 's headquarters before this summer . 
One employee with the group said RJR moved 11 employees of the group back to New York in September because `` there was supposed to be a future . '' 
The RJR spokesman said the company moved the 11 employees to New York last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks ' upcoming season . 
Brazil , similar to Mexico and South Korea , is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U.S. market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas , which expired Sept. 30 . 
In recent years , U.S. steelmakers have supplied about 80 % of the 100 million tons of steel used annually by the nation . 
Of the remaining 20 % needed , the steel-quota negotiations allocate about 15 % to foreign suppliers , with the difference supplied mainly by Canada -- which is n't included in the quota program . 
It also said it would use that two-and-a-half year period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade , which has been notoriously managed , subsidized and protected by governments . 
Mexico , which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the U.S. , virtually doubled its quota to 0.95 % of the U.S. steel market from 0.48 % under the previous quotas . 
South Korea , which had 1.9 % under the previous quotas , is set to get a small increase to about 1.95 % . 
The EC and Japan -- the U.S. 's largest steel suppliers -- have n't been filling their quotas to the full extent . 
The EC steel industry , which has been coping with strong European demand , has been supplying about 5 % of the U.S. market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7 % . 
Japan , the EC , Brazil , Mexico and South Korea provide about 80 % of the steel imported to the U.S. under the quota program . 
The U.S. had about an extra 2 % of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks . 
Elcotel , a telecommunications company , had net income of $ 272,000 , or five cents a share , in its year-earlier second quarter , ended Sept. 30 . 
Elcotel , a telecommunications company , had net income of $ 272,000 , or five cents a share , in its year-earlier second quarter , ended Sept. 30 . Revenue totaled $ 5 million . 
The lower results , Mr. Pierce said , reflect a 12-month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones , Elcotel 's primary business . 
Foremost among those is the company 's entrance into the public facsimile business , Mr. Pierce said . 
Within the next year , Elcotel expects to place 10,000 fax machines , made by Minolta in Japan , in hotels , municipal buildings , drugstores and other public settings around the country . 
Elcotel has also developed an automatic call processor that will make further use of the company 's system for automating and handling credit-card calls and collect calls . 
The Cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in Japan when Kao introduced a powerful detergent , called Attack , which quickly won a 30 % stake in the Japanese markets . 
A P&G spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to Phoenix started late last month . 
Superconcentrates are n't entirely new for P&G . 
The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after watching the success of Attack . 
When Attack hit the shelves in 1987 , P&G 's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 % . 
With superconcentrates , however , it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more 
And retailers are expected to embrace the product , in part because it will take up less shelf space . 
But with so many brands vying for space , that 's no longer the case . 
Competition is bound to get tougher if Kao introduces a product like Attack in the U.S. . 
Some believe P&G 's interest in a superconcentrated detergent goes beyond the concern for the Japanese . 
With economic tension between the U.S. and Japan worsening , many Japanese had feared last week 's visit from U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills . 
Instead , they got a discussion of the need for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view . 
Mr. Mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental Japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade . 
But Mrs. Hills , speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday , stressed that the objective `` is not to get definitive action by spring or summer , it is rather to have a blueprint for action . '' 
American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills . 
But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic . 
`` I think my line has been very consistent , '' Mrs. Hills said at a news conference Saturday afternoon . 
`` I am painted sometimes as ferocious , perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes to implement . 
I do n't feel very ferocious . 
I do n't feel either hard or soft . 
When she met the local press for the first time on Friday , Mrs. Hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products , satellites and supercomputers , three areas targeted under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill . 
But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition . 
At her news conference for Japanese reporters , one economics journalist summed up the Japanese sense of relief . 
The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck around 10 % for years . 
But she stressed , `` I am against managed trade . 
The company did n't break out its fourth-quarter results . 
Separately , the company said it would file a delayed fiscal-year report with the Securities and Exchange Commission `` within approximately 45 days . '' 
Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago , largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability . 
The industry is `` seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals , '' Glenn Cox , president of Phillips Petroleum Co. , said in an interview . 
Typical is what happened to the price of ethylene , a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies . 
It has plunged 13 % since July to around 26 cents a pound . 
Beginning in mid-1987 , prices began accelerating as a growing U.S. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand . 
Companies added capacity furiously . 
Third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker . 
Oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in July and August that did n't materialize . 
Refiners say margins picked up in September , and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter , though still not to the level of 1988 's fourth quarter . 
Crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies ' earnings this year . 
Prices -- averaging roughly $ 2 a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier -- have stayed well above most companies ' expectations . 
Demand has been much stronger than anticipated , and it typically accelerates in the fourth quarter . 
While oil prices have been better than expected , natural gas prices have been worse . 
In the third quarter , they averaged about 5 % less than they were in 1988 . 
The main reason remains weather . 
But the Bush administration says it wants to see evidence that all Cocom members are complying fully with existing export-control procedures before it will support further liberalization . 
The London Sunday Times , which first reported the U.S. concerns , cited a U.S. intelligence report as the source of the allegations that Olivetti exported $ 25 million in `` embargoed , state-of-the-art , flexible manufacturing systems to the Soviet aviation industry . '' 
A State Department spokesman acknowledged that the U.S. is discussing the allegations with the Italian government and Cocom , but declined to confirm any details . 
Although the legality of these sales is still an open question , the disclosure could n't be better timed to support the position of export-control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community . 
The Bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export-control policies , reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies . 
However , these agencies generally agree that the West should be cautious about any further liberalization . 
The 50 million warrants will be priced at HK$ 1.25 each and are expected to carry a premium to the share price of about 26 % . In trading on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong , the shares closed Wednesday at HK$ 4.80 each . 
In a suit filed in federal court Thursday , the S&L alleged that a `` disproportionate number '' of the bonds it purchased in 1984 declined in value . 
But HOFI 's first offer would have given Ideal 's other shareholders about 10 % of the combined company . 
In response to dwindling domestic supplies , Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter last month said the U.S. government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments . 
The government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about 66 million bushels . 
But the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted wo n't be felt until the second half of next year . 
Until then , limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $ 4-a-bushel level , analysts say . 
In July , the CBOT ordered Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p . A. to liquidate futures positions equal to about 23 million bushels of soybeans . 
The exchange said it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the Italian conglomerate , which had refused requests to reduce its holdings . 
For example , in the Oklahoma panhandle , 40 % or more of the topsoil is short of moisture . 
The Soviet Union has n't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans , but many analysts expect Moscow to place sizable orders for U.S. wheat in the next few months , further supporting prices . 
Late Thursday , after the close of trading , the market received what would normally have been a bullish U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of the 1989-90 Florida orange crop . 
However , as expected , Brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about $ 1.34 a pound from around $ 1.55 . 
Friday 's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the U.S. report might have had and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time . 
Brazilian juice , after a delay caused by drought at the start of its crop season , is beginning to arrive in the U.S. in large quantities . 
The price cut , one analyst said , appeared to be aimed even more at Europe , where consumption of Brazilian juice has fallen . 
New York futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $ 2 a pound at midyear . 
Friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets . 
`` This market still wants to go higher , '' said Nauman Barakat , a first vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . 
There has been little news to account for such buoyancy in the oil markets . 
There also are recurring reports that the Soviet Union is having difficulties with its oil exports and that Nigeria has about reached its production limit and ca n't produce as much as it could sell . 
And Carl Spielvogel , chief executive officer of Saatchi 's big Backer Spielvogel Bates advertising unit , said he had offered to lead a management buy-out of the company , but was rebuffed by Charles Saatchi . 
But -LCB- otherwise -RCB- it would undoubtedly come back '' with an offer by management . 
The executive denied speculation that Saatchi was bringing in the new chief executive officer only to clean up the company financially so that the brothers could lead a buy-back . 
That speculation abounded Friday as industry executives analyzed the appointment of the new chief executive , Robert Louis-Dreyfus , who joins Saatchi and becomes a member of its board on Jan. 1 . 
Asked about the speculation that Mr. Louis-Dreyfus has been hired to pave the way for a buy-out by the brothers , the executive replied , `` That is n't the reason Dreyfus has been brought in . 
`` It has n't had any impact on us , nor do we expect it to , '' said a spokeswoman for Miller Brewing Co. , a major client of Backer Spielvogel . 
John Lampe , director of advertising at PaineWebber Inc. , a Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising client , said : `` We have no problem with the announcement , because we do n't know what change it 's going to bring about . 
Executives at Backer Spielvogel client Avis Inc. , as well as at Saatchi client Philips Lighting Co. , also said they saw no effect . 
Executives at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. , a Backer Spielvogel client that is reviewing its account , declined comment . 
The Samsung Group and Bozell Inc. agreed to establish a joint venture advertising agency in South Korea . 
The maker of computer-data-storage products said net income rose to $ 4.8 million , or 23 cents a share , from year-earlier net of $ 1.1 million , or five cents a share . 
Maxtor said its results were boosted by $ 2 million in payments received from a supplier , for a certain line of products that Maxtor is n't going to sell anymore . 
Maxtor said effects from discontinuing the line may have a positive effect on future earnings and revenue . 
In the fiscal first half , net was $ 7 million , or 34 cents a share , up from the year-earlier $ 3.1 million , or 15 cents a share . 
The real estate and thrift concern , operating under bankruptcy-law proceedings , said it told the SEC it could n't provide financial statements by the end of its first extension `` without unreasonable burden or expense . '' 
MedChem said the court 's ruling was issued as part of a `` first-phase trial '' in the patent-infringement proceedings and concerns only one of its defenses in the case . 
It said it is considering `` all of its options in light of the decision , including a possible appeal . '' 
Adding to unsteadiness in the industry , seasonal retail ad spending patterns in newspapers have been upset by shifts in ownership and general hardships within the retail industry . 
Until recently , industry analysts believed decreases in retail ad spending had bottomed out and would in fact increase in this year 's third and fourth quarters . 
`` Improved paper prices will help offset weakness in linage , but the retailers ' problems have affected the amount of ad linage they usually run , '' said Edward J. Atorino , industry analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc . 
For instance , Gannett Co. posted an 11 % gain in net income , as total ad pages dropped at USA Today , but advertising revenue rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates . 
Gannett 's 83 daily and 35 non-daily newspapers reported a 3 % increase in advertising and circulation revenue . 
While USA Today 's total paid ad pages for the year to date totaled 2,735 , a decrease of 4 % from last year , the paper 's ad revenue increased 8 % in the quarter and 13 % in the nine months . 
In the nine months , Gannett 's net rose 9.5 % to $ 270 million , or $ 1.68 a share , from $ 247 million , or $ 1.52 a share . 
At Dow Jones & Co. , third-quarter net income fell 9.9 % from the year-earlier period . 
Net fell to $ 28.8 million , or 29 cents a share , from $ 32 million , or 33 cents a share . 
The drop in profit reflected , in part , continued softness in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and Barron 's magazine . 
Affiliated Publications Inc. reversed a year-earlier third quarter net loss . 
Third-quarter profit estimates for several companies are being strongly affected by the price of newsprint , which in the last two years has had several price increases . 
Companies with daily newspapers in the Northeast will need the stable newsprint prices to ease damage from weak ad linage . 
Mr. Atorino at Salomon Brothers said he estimates that Times Mirror Co. 's earnings were down for the third quarter , because of soft advertising levels at its Long Island Newsday and Hartford Courant newspapers . 
GM is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker 's U.S. market share skidded during the past decade . 
The company , currently using about 80 % of its North American vehicle capacity , has vowed it will run at 100 % of capacity by 1992 . 
Now , GM appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s . 
One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U.S. that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than GM can match . 
Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no-layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that will be negotiated next year . 
The problem , however , is that GM 's moves are coming at a time when UAW leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs . 
Against that backdrop , UAW Vice President Stephen P. Yokich , who recently became head of the union 's GM department , issued a statement Friday blasting GM 's `` flagrant insensitivity '' toward union members . 
GM officials told workers late last week of the following moves : Production of full-sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in Flint , Mich . 
The shutdowns will idle about 3,000 Canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in Ohio . 
Workers at plants in Van Nuys , Calif. , Oklahoma City and Pontiac , Mich. , were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars . 
That announcement left union officials in Van Nuys and Oklahoma City uncertain about their futures . 
The Van Nuys plant , which employs about 3,000 workers , does n't have a product to build after 1993 . 
At the Oklahoma City plant , which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight-year-old A-body mid-sized cars , Steve Featherston , UAW local vice president , said the plant has no new product lined up , and `` none of us knows '' when the A-body cars will die . 
Union officials have taken a beating politically as a result . 
Merieux said the government 's minister of industry , science and technology told it that he was n't convinced that the purchase is likely to be of `` net benefit '' to Canada . 
The government 's action was unusual . 
Alan Nymark , executive vice president of Investment Canada , which oversees foreign takeovers , said it marked the first time in its four-year history that the agency has made an adverse net-benefit decision about the acquisition of a publicly traded company . 
`` This is n't a change in government policy 
Mr. Mehta said the move that could allow the transaction to go ahead as planned could be an out-of-court settlement of Connaught 's dispute with the University of Toronto . 
The company said it planned to offer an undetermined number of common shares in exchange for the 585,000 shares of its preferred stock outstanding . 
The energy-services concern said , however , that in January 1990 , it may resume payments of dividends on the preferred stock . 
Analysts said that Merck & Co. , Eli Lilly & Co. , Warner-Lambert Co. and the Squibb Corp. unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. all benefited from strong sales of relatively new , higher-priced medicines that provide wide profit margins . 
Analysts said profit for the dozen or so big drug makers , as a group , is estimated to have climbed between 11 % and 14 % . 
Mr. Sweig estimated that Merck 's profit for the quarter rose by about 22 % , propelled by sales of its line-up of fast-growing prescription drugs , including its anti-cholesterol drug , Mevacor ; a high blood pressure medicine , Vasotec ; Primaxin , an antibiotic , and Pepcid , an anti-ulcer medication . 
Profit climbed even though Merck 's sales were reduced by `` one to three percentage points '' as a result of the strong dollar , Mr. Sweig said . 
Mr. Sweig said he estimated that Lilly 's earnings for the quarter jumped about 20 % , largely because of the performance of its new anti-depressant Prozac . 
The drug , introduced last year , is expected to generate sales of about $ 300 million this year . 
The company is praised by analysts for sharply lowering its costs in recent years and shedding numerous companies with low profit margins . 
The company 's lean operation , analysts said , allowed sharp-rising sales from its cholesterol drug , Lopid , to power earnings growth . 
Lopid sales are expected to be about $ 300 million this year , up from $ 190 million in 1988 . 
In Madison , N.J. , a spokesman for Schering-Plough said the company has `` no problems '' with the average estimate by a analysts that third-quarter earnings per share rose by about 19 % , to $ 1 . 
Meanwhile , analysts said Pfizer 's recent string of lackluster quarterly performances continued , as earnings in the quarter were expected to decline by about 5 % . 
Sales of Pfizer 's important drugs , Feldene for treating arthritis , and Procardia , a heart medicine , have shrunk because of increased competition . 
The database software company said it expects a $ 2 million net loss for the fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30 . 
Revenue is expected to be `` up modestly '' from the $ 26.5 million reported a year ago . 
`` While our international operations showed strong growth , our domestic business was substantially below expectations , '' said Paul Newton , president and chief executive officer . 
Mr. Newton said he accepted the resignation of Thomas Wilson , vice president of corporate sales , and that his marketing responsibilities have been reassigned . 
It fell $ 1.875 a share Friday , to $ 6.25 , a new low , in over-the-counter trading . 
But Laura Cunningham 's Bronx , her childhood Bronx of the '50s , is something else altogether . 
Ms. Cunningham , a novelist and playwright , has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall . 
She transforms her `` Bronx of the emotions , a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria '' into the `` Babylonian Bronx , '' a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue . 
Little Lily , as Ms. Cunningham calls herself in the book , really was n't ordinary . 
She was raised , for the first eight years , by her mother , Rosie , whom she remembers as a loving liar , who realigned history to explain why Lily 's father did n't live with them . 
The games Bronx children played -LRB- holding kids down and stripping them , for example -RRB- seem tame by today 's crack standards , but Ms. Cunningham makes it all sound like a great adventure . 
She analyzed families by their sleeping arrangements . 
Her friend Susan , whose parents kept reminding her she was unwanted , slept on a narrow bed wedged into her parents ' bedroom , as though she were a temporary visitor . 
Maybe Lily became so obsessed with where people slept and how because her own arrangements kept shifting . 
When Rosie died , her uncles moved in -- and let her make the sleeping and other household arrangements . 
They came by their strangeness honestly . 
Harry is now a 57-year-old writer , whose continuing flirtation with drugs and marginal types in Hollywood and New York seems quaintly out-of-synch . 
Harry fondly remembers the `` old '' days of the early '70s , when people like his friend Travis would take a psychiatrist on a date to analyze what Travis was doing wrong . 
But it does n't take too many lines to figure Harry out . 
Gulf Resources earlier this year proposed a reorganization plan that would make it a unit of a Bermuda concern , potentially exempting it from liability for the smelter 's cleanup costs . 
The company said that as part of its agreement with the EPA , it `` made certain voluntary undertakings with respect to intercorporate transactions entered into after the reorganization . '' 
The company , which issued a statement on the agreement late Friday , said that $ 1 million of the payment was previously provided for in its financial statements and that $ 500,000 will be recognized in its 1989 third-quarter statement . 
Under the agreement , Gulf must give the U.S. government 45 days ' advance written notice before issuing any dividends on common stock . 
Under the agreement , Gulf must give the U.S. government 45 days ' advance written notice before issuing any dividends on common stock . The company 's net worth can not fall below $ 185 million after the dividends are issued . 
In addition , Gulf must give the government 20 days ' advance written notice of any loans exceeding $ 50 million that are made to the Bermuda-based holding company . 
Assuming that the market does n't head into a bottomless free fall , some executives think Friday 's action could prove a harbinger of good news -- as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be abating . 
A few of the executives here for the fall meeting of the Business Council , a group that meets to discuss national issues , were only too happy to personalize their criticism . 
`` People wish the government would do something about leveraged buy-outs , do something about takeovers , do something about Donald Trump , '' said Rand Araskog , chairman of ITT Corp. , whose stock dropped $ 3.375 . 
`` Where 's the leadership ? 
`` I 'm not going to worry about one day 's decline , '' said Kenneth Olsen , Digital Equipment Corp. president , who was leisurely strolling through the bright orange and yellow leaves of the mountains here after his company 's shares plunged $ 5.75 to close at $ 86.50 . 
`` I did n't bother calling anybody 
`` There has n't been any fundamental change in the economy , '' added John Smale , whose Procter & Gamble Co. took an $ 8.75 slide to close at $ 120.75 . 
Indeed , one chief executive who was downright delighted by Friday 's events was Robert Crandall , chairman of AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines and the target of a takeover offer by Mr. Trump . 
On Friday morning , before the market 's sell-off , the business leaders issued a report predicting the economy would grow at roughly an inflation-adjusted 2 % annual rate , through next year , then accelerate anew in 1991 . 
In Manhattan , once-desirable store sites sit vacant and newly constructed space has been slow to fill . 
`` There is an unbelievable amount of space available , '' says Faith Consolo , senior vice president at Garrick-Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc . 
There are about 2,000 stores for rent , up from a more typical range of 1,200 to 1,500 . 
`` This further confuses retailers , '' she says . 
`` They wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down ? 
`` They wonder should they sign a lease if prices are still coming down ? Is this the wrong time to open a store ? 
But on average , Manhattan retail rents have dropped 10 % to 15 % in the past six months alone , experts say . 
The same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing . 
He says financial problems plaguing electronics , fur and furniture companies -- key categories in the local retail economy -- have further deflated the market . 
Hardest hit are what he calls `` secondary '' sites that primarily serve neighborhood residents . 
In these locations , Mr. Friedman says , `` Retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined . '' 
It is also no comfort to landlords and small New York retailers when the future of larger department stores , which anchor retail neighborhoods , are in doubt . 
Certainly , the recent drop in prices does n't mean Manhattan comes cheap . 
New York retail rents still run well above the going rate in other U.S. cities . 
Madison and Fifth Avenues and East 57th Street can command rents of up to $ 500 a square foot , and $ 250 is not uncommon .

For the first time , the 83-year-old justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent , rather than as a force in the high court 's majority . 
Every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role , and the frustrations that go with it , but in different ways . 
Justices Brennan and Stevens appear philosophical about it 
The change is most dramatic for Justice Brennan , the last survivor of the mid-1960s liberal majority under Chief Justice Earl Warren . 
In the seven Supreme Court terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967 , the height of the Warren Court 's power , Justice Brennan cast only 25 dissenting votes in 555 cases decided by the court . 
But Justice Brennan foresaw his new role , strongly defending the importance of dissents in a 1985 speech . 
Moreover , in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s , he knew that the tables might turn in the future . 
Associates of 81-year-old Justice Marshall say he was `` depressed '' about the court 's direction last spring , but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights . 
He , like Justice Brennan , considers dissents highly important for the future , a point that has n't escaped legal scholars . 
Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe says there is a `` generation-skipping '' flavor to current dissents . 
The dissenters in the Warren Court , he says , appeared to be writing for the short-term , suggesting that the court 's direction might change soon . 
Justice Blackmun , who will turn 81 next month , also seems feisty about his new role . 
But his level of frustration showed in a recent , impassioned speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in Chicago . 
If the role these four dissenters are assuming is a familiar one in modern Supreme Court history , it also differs in an important way from recent history , court watchers say . 
Two of the four big thrifts were sold to NCNB Corp. , Charlotte , N.C. , which has aggressively expanded its markets , particularly in Texas and Florida . 
Under these deals , the RTC sells just the deposits and the healthy assets . 
The buyers will also be locked into deposit rates for just two weeks , as has been the case with previous deals . 
The RTC had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales in order to spend cash by certain budgetary deadlines , but the delays illustrate the tough chore facing the agency . 
NCNB continued its foray into the Florida and Texas markets . 
NCNB will acquire University Federal Savings Association , Houston , which had assets of $ 2.8 billion . 
NCNB also acquired Freedom Savings & Loan Association , Tampa , Fla. , which had total assets of $ 900 million . 
Meridian Bancorp Inc. , Reading , Pa. , will acquire Hill Financial Savings Association , Red Hill , Pa. , which had $ 2.3 billion in assets . 
In the first RTC transaction with a foreign buyer , Royal Trustco Ltd. , Toronto , will acquire Pacific Savings Bank , Costa Mesa , Calif. , which had $ 949 million in assets . 
In an announcement to its staff last week , executives at Time Warner Inc. 's weekly magazine said Time will `` dramatically de-emphasize '' its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives 
Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high , and expensive , circulations is the way to draw advertisers . 
Besides , Time executives think selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tacky . 
`` Giveaways just give people the wrong image , '' said Mr. Heinemann . 
Time magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers . 
`` What we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and do n't really read it , '' said Mr. Heinemann . 
Still , Time 's move is being received well , once again . 
`` It 's terrific for advertisers to know the reader will be paying more , '' said Michael Drexler , national media director at Bozell Inc. ad agency . 
`` A few drops in circulation are of no consequence . 
It 's not a show of weakness 
Mr. Heinemann said the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry : a magazine 's net revenue per subscriber , or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away . 
When the news broke of an attempted coup in Panama two weeks ago , Sen. Christopher Dodd called the State Department for a briefing . 
That shows how far Ted Turner 's Cable News Network has come since its birth nine years ago , when it was considered the laughingstock of television news . 
It is bigger , faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks . 
But for all its success , CNN has hit a plateau . 
Although viewership soars when big news breaks , it ebbs during periods of calm . 
`` Just the fact we 're on 24 hours is no longer bulletin , '' says Ed Turner , CNN 's executive vice president , news gathering -LRB- and no relation to Ted Turner -RRB- . 
So CNN , a unit of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc. , is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel , or what people in the television industry call a `` top of mind '' network . 
The new show is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more full-length `` signature '' programming with recognizable stars . 
To distinguish itself , CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program . 
But that wo n't be easy . 
The repositioning bid is aimed at CNN 's unsteady viewership -- and what may happen to it as the cable-TV news market grows more competitive . 
CNN wants to change its viewers ' habits . 
Its watchers are , on the whole , a disloyal group of channel-zapping `` grazers '' and news junkies , who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN , according to audience research . 
That 's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks . 
Its strategy in the past has been to serve as a TV wire service . 
It focused on building up its news bureaus around the world , so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks . 
Now , the push is on for more-distinctive shows . 
Some in the industry are skeptical . 
The evening news is also slated as CNN 's stage for its big push into investigative journalism . 
She 's assembling a staff of about 35 investigative reporters who will produce weekly , in-depth segments , with an eye toward breaking big stories . 
That 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical CNN will follow through with its investigative commitment , especially after it sees the cost of producing in-depth pieces . 
The network 's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards , resulting in a less-experienced work force . 
Says Mr. Mosettig : `` CNN is my wire service 
In any case , cable-TV-system operators have reason to fear any tinkering with CNN 's format . 
They market cable-TV on the very grazing opportunities CNN seeks to discourage . 
The fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound . 
In the Pennzoil\/Texaco litigation , the courts found Pennzoil and Getty Oil intended to be bound 
The S&L lawyers were encouraged last month by an appellate-court ruling in two cases brought against defunct Sunbelt Savings & Loan Association of Dallas by the developers of the Valley Ranch , best known as the training center for the Dallas Cowboys football team . 
`` We 're asking the court for a number of things he can grant in addition to the thrill of victory , '' he says .

Friday , 42 franchisees announced the formation of an association -- called A.P. Association Inc. -- to `` preserve the integrity of the Arby 's system . '' 
The franchisees , owners or operators of 1,000 of the 1,900 franchised Arby 's in the U.S. , said : `` We have concluded that continued control of Arby 's by Victor Posner is totally unacceptable to us , because it is extremely likely to cause irreparable damage to the Arby 's system . 
Although the report , which was released before the stock market opened , did n't trigger the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , analysts said it did play a role in the market 's decline . 
Further fueling the belief that pressures in the economy were sufficient to keep the Fed from easing credit , the Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales grew 0.5 % in September , to $ 145.21 billion . 
But Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis , blamed rising energy prices and the annual autumn increase in car prices for most of the September jump . 
`` I would say this is not bad news 
`` I would say this is not bad news ; this is a blip , '' he said . 
Overall , the index has climbed at a 5.1 % compound annual rate since the start of the year , the Labor Department said . 
Moreover , this year 's good inflation news may have ended last month , when energy prices zoomed up 6.5 % after plunging 7.3 % in August . 
Analysts had expected that the climb in oil prices last month would lead to a substantial rise in the producer price index , but the 0.9 % climb was higher than most anticipated . 
`` I think the resurgence -LCB- in inflation -RCB- is going to continue for a few months , '' said John Mueller , chief economist at Bell Mueller Cannon , a Washington economic forecasting firm . 
But Dirk Van Dongen , president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors , said that last month 's rise `` is n't as bad an omen '' as the 0.9 % figure suggests . 
Passenger car prices jumped 3.8 % in September , after climbing 0.5 % in August and declining in the late spring and summer . 
Many analysts said the September increase was a one-time event , coming as dealers introduced their 1990 models . 
Prices for capital equipment rose a hefty 1.1 % in September , while prices for home electronic equipment fell 1.1 % . 
Producer prices for intermediate goods grew 0.4 % in September , after dropping for three consecutive months . 
CityFed 's president and chief executive officer , John Atherton , said the loss stems from several factors . 
He said nonperforming assets rose to slightly more than $ 700 million from $ 516 million between June and September . 
Mr. Atherton said CityFed will also mark its portfolio of high-yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings institutions divest themselves of such bonds . 
David L. Paul , chairman and chief executive officer , criticized the federal Office of Thrift Supervision , which issued the directive , saying it was `` inappropriate '' and based on `` insufficient '' reasons . 
In March , regulators labeled CenTrust a `` troubled institution , '' largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses . 
CenTrust , which is Florida 's largest thrift , holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation . 
Since April , it has pared its high-yield bond holdings to about $ 890 million from $ 1.35 billion . 
Mr. Paul said only about $ 150 million of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission . 
CenTrust and regulators have been in a dispute over market valuations for the junk bonds . 
Regulators have become increasingly antsy about CenTrust 's and other thrifts ' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market . 
The branch sale is the centerpiece of CenTrust 's strategy to transform itself into a traditional S&L from a high-flying institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits , according to Mr. Paul . 
Most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction , which was announced in July , long before now . 
CenTrust , however , touts the branch sale , saying it would bring in $ 150 million and reduce the thrift 's assets to $ 6.7 billion from $ 9 billion . 
The most militant opposition to American TV imports has come from French television and movie producers , who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full 60 % of Europe 's TV shows be produced in Europe . 
A glance through the television listings and a few twists of the European television dial suggest one reason why . 
While there are some popular action and drama series , few boast the high culture and classy production values one might expect . 
One of France 's most popular Saturday night programs features semi-celebrities seeking out their grammar-school classmates for on-air reunions . 
One of France 's most popular Saturday night programs features semi-celebrities seeking out their grammar-school classmates for on-air reunions . A Flemish game show has as its host a Belgian pretending to be Italian . 
If this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the protectionist barriers , it may be because these shows need all the protection they can get . 
European programs usually target only their own local audience , and often only a small portion of that . 
Attempts to produce `` pan-European '' programs have generally resulted in disappointment . 
One annual co-production , the three-hour-long `` Eurovision Song Contest , '' featuring soft-rock songs from each of 20 European countries , has been described as the world 's most boring TV show . 
Another , `` Jeux Sans Frontieres , '' where villagers from assorted European countries make fools of themselves performing pointless tasks , is a hit in France . 
For the most part , what 's made here stays here , and for good reason . 
The cream of the British crop , the literary dramas that are shown on U.S. public television as `` Masterpiece Theater , '' make up a relatively small part of British air time . 
The most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns . 
A French knock-off of `` Dallas , '' called `` Chateauvallon '' and set in a French vineyard , had a good run in France , which ended after the female lead was injured in a real-life auto accident . 
Italy 's most popular series is a drama called `` La Piovra , '' or `` The Octopus , '' which chronicles the fight of an idealistic young investigator in Palermo against the Mafia . 
Italy 's most popular series is a drama called `` La Piovra , '' or `` The Octopus , '' which chronicles the fight of an idealistic young investigator in Palermo against the Mafia . It was front-page news in Italy earlier this year when the fictional inspector was gunned down in the series . 
`` The trend is pretty well established now that local programs are the most popular , with American programs second , '' says Brian Wenham , a former director of programs for the British Broadcasting Corp . 
Thus , Europe has begun the recent crusade to produce more worthy shows of its own , programs with broader appeal . 
Until recently , national governments in Europe controlled most of the air time and allowed little or no advertising . 
Now , however , commercial channels are coming to most European countries , and at the same time , satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly . 
Now , however , commercial channels are coming to most European countries , and at the same time , satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly . Just last week , Greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time ; Spain earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels . 
Sky Channel , a British-based venture of Australian-American press tycoon Rupert Murdoch , offers what must be a baffling cultural mix to most of its audience . 
The financially struggling station offers programs obviously made available cheaply from its boss 's other ventures . 
After two years of talks , plans for the venture are sufficiently advanced for the companies to seek French and British government clearance . 
The venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies , and help make them a leading force in European defense contracting . 
Already , British Aerospace and French government-controlled Thomson-CSF collaborate on a British missile contract and on an air-traffic control radar system . 
But it may be weeks before GEC and its potential partners decide whether to bid , the source indicated . 
Also , any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators 
At least one potential GEC partner , Matra , insists it is n't interested in Ferranti . 
The missile venture , the British Aerospace spokeswoman said , is a needed response to the `` new environment '' in defense contracting . 
The venture 's importance for Thomson is great . 
Thomson feels the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans . 
In missiles , Thomson is already overshadowed by British Aerospace and by its home rival , France 's Aerospatiale 
Interprovincial , Canada 's biggest oil pipeline operator and a major transporter of crude to the U.S. , said revised industry forecasts indicate that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991 , 8 % lower than a previous estimate . 
`` The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping , '' and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically , as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas , said Ronald Watkins , vice president for government and industry relations with Interprovincial 's parent , Interhome Energy Inc . 
Many of Canada 's oil and gas producers say the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil , and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly . 
Canada 's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day , or about 9.1 % of net U.S. crude imports , said John Lichtblau , president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation . 
Under terms of its proposed two-step expansion , which would have required regulatory approval , Interprovincial intended to add 200,000 barrels a day of additional capacity to its system , beginning with a modest expansion by 1991 . 
At the same time , the integrated-steel business was hurt by continued increases in materials costs and repair and maintenance expenses , as well as higher labor costs under its new contract . 
Last week , Microsoft said it expects revenue for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 to increase 34 % . 
Microsoft 's surprising strength is one example of the difficulty facing investors looking for reassurances about the financial health of the computer firms . 
`` It 's hard to know what to expect at this point , '' said Peter Rogers , an analyst at Robertson Stephens & Co . 
Another contradictory message comes from Businessland Inc. , a computer retailer . 
This month , however , Businessland warned investors that results for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 had n't met expectations . 
Companies will continue to war over standards . 
In computer publishing , a battle over typefaces is hurting Adobe Systems Inc. , which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays . 
The short-term outlook for Adobe 's business , however , appears strong . 
Meanwhile , competition between various operating systems , which control the basic functions of a computer , spells trouble for software firms generally . 
The gap between winners and laggards will grow . 
Wyse Technology , for instance , is considered a candidate to sell its troubled operation . 
`` Wyse has done well establishing a distribution business , but they have n't delivered products that sell , '' said Kimball Brown , an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities . 
Personal-computer makers will continue to eat away at the business of more traditional computer firms . 
But they will have to act quickly .

At least that 's what a survey by Ernst & Young and Yankelovich , Clancy , Shulman indicates . 
Two-thirds of respondents said they strongly felt the need to be successful in their jobs , while fewer than half said they strongly felt the need to spend more time with their families . 
Unlike most studies of the affluent market , this survey excluded the super-rich . 
The goal was to learn about one of today 's fastest-growing income groups , the upper-middle class . 
Despite their considerable incomes and assets , 40 % of the respondents in the study do n't feel financially secure , and one-fourth do n't feel that they have made it . 
Many of the affluent are n't comfortable with themselves , either . 
About 40 % do n't feel they 're more able than others . 
THE NUMBER of women and minorities who hold jobs in top management in the nation 's largest banks has more than doubled since 1978 .

The council 's action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been maligned unjustly for years . 
`` Obviously they 're not in touch with what 's going on , '' says Tom Manske , vice president of the National Pocket Billiards Association . 
Pool is hot in New York and Chicago , he insists , where `` upscale , suit-and-tie places '' are adding tables . 
Besides , rowdy behavior seems unlikely at the Grand Kempinski , where rooms average $ 200 a night and the cheap mixed drinks go for $ 3.50 a pop . 
But a majority of the Addison council did n't buy those arguments . 
Introducing pool , argued Councilwoman Riley Reinker , would be `` dangerous . 
Addison is no stranger to cans of worms , either . 
The revelations embarrassed town officials , although they argued that the problems were n't as severe as the media suggested . 
`` I think there 's some people worried about something pretty ridiculous , '' Councilman John Nolan says .

Here , in neutral language , is the gist of Mr. Mason 's remarks , quoted first in the Village Voice while he was a paid spokesman for the Rudolph Giuliani mayoral campaign , and then in Newsweek after he and the campaign parted company . 
Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks , so they support black candidates uncritically . 
He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination , so they , too , support black candidates uncritically . 
Of course , Mr. Mason did not use neutral language . 
As a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the Borscht Belt , live television and the nightclub circuit , Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular . 
For example , the New York state counsel for the NAACP said that Mr. Mason is `` like a dinosaur . 
But wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason , it is a constructive form of mischief . 
Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing , they are similar in one respect 
Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing , they are similar in one respect : Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict . 
As Elizabeth Kristol wrote in the New York Times just before the Mason donnybrook , `` Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer . '' 
Do n't say the TV sitcom , because that happens to be a genre that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody , resembles politics more than it does comedy . 
It 's worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants . 
At least , they both speak with strong accents , as do Jackie and Maddie . 
Clearly , the question with `` Chicken Soup '' is not whether the pot will boil over , but whether it will simmer at all . 
So far , the bubbles have been few and far between . 
Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms , ever since the didactic days of Norman Lear , to preach about social issues . 
For instance , Michael dislikes Jackie not because he 's a shrewd Jewish businessman , but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker . 
Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason 's comic persona . 
I 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic-Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz . 
But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about `` caring for other people '' that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America . 
Here 's what Ronald Reagan said after the 1987 crash : `` The underlying economy remains sound . 
There is nothing wrong with the economy 
Late Friday night , the Senate voted 87-7 to approve an estimated $ 13.5 billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened , rather than narrowed , the federal budget deficit . 
White House Budget Director Richard Darman told reporters yesterday that the administration would n't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill . 
Opponents of the cut are playing hardball . 
The Senate bill was pared back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through Congress . 
Senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the House to agree to the streamlined bill . 
The House appears reluctant to join the senators . 
The Senate bill was stripped of many popular , though revenue-losing , provisions , a number of which are included in the House-passed bill . 
To the delight of some doctors , the bill dropped a plan passed by the Finance Committee that would have overhauled the entire physician-reimbursement system under Medicare . 
Asked why senators were giving up so much , New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici , the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee , said , `` We 're looking like idiots . 
Sen. Dole said that the move required sacrifice by every senator . 
In addition , the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a 3 % excise tax on long-distance telephone calls . 
Also stricken was a fivefold increase in the maximum Occupational Safety and Health Administration penalties , which would have raised $ 65 million in fiscal 1990 . 
The approval of the Senate bill was especially sweet for Sen. Mitchell , who had proposed the streamlining . 
The deficit reduction bill contains $ 5.3 billion in tax increases in fiscal 1990 , and $ 26 billion over five years . 
-- Close a loophole regarding employee stock ownership plans , effective June 6 , 1989 , that has been exploited by investment bankers in corporate takeovers . 
I was laid off in August 1988 , and after a thorough and exhausting job search , was hired in August 1989 . 
My unemployment insurance ran out before I found a job 
Are you kidding ? 
Looking for a job was one of the most anxious periods of my life -- and is for most people . 
Moody 's Investors Service said it reduced its rating on $ 165 million of subordinated debt of this Beverly Hills , Calif. , thrift , citing turmoil in the market for low-grade , high-yield securities . 
Columbia Savings is a major holder of so-called junk bonds . 
Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded its rating to B-2 from Ba-3 on less than $ 20 million of this thrift 's senior subordinated notes . 
The rating concern said Franklin 's `` troubled diversification record in the securities business '' was one reason for the downgrade , citing the troubles at its L.F. Rothschild subsidiary and the possible sale of other subsidiaries . 
`` They perhaps had concern that we were getting out of all these , '' said Franklin President Duane H. Hall . 
`` Everyone will tell you that this time is different from 1987 , '' he says . 
Right now they 're telling me to get the hell out and stay out . 
I see no major support until 2200 . 
Mr. Granville says he would n't even think of buying until at least 600 to 700 stocks have hit 52-week lows 
Friday 's big drop , she says , `` was not a crash . 
Thus , she says , if the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped below 2450 , `` It would just be a fluke . 
`` There was a unique combination in 1987 , '' he says . 
`` Margin debt was at a record high . 
`` Margin debt was at a record high . There was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds . 
The main thing was portfolio insurance , '' a mechanical trading system intended to protect an investor against losses . `` A hundred billion dollars in stock was subject '' to it . 
`` I think the market will be heading down into November , '' he says . 
`` I think the market will be heading down into November , '' he says . `` We will probably have a year-end rally , and then go down again . 
He expects the downturn to carry the Dow Jones Industrial Average down to around 2000 sometime next year . 
`` That would be a normal bear market , '' he says . 
`` I do n't think the market is going through another October '87 . 
Mr. Cooperman sees this as a good time to pick up bargains , but he does n't think there 's any need to rush . 
He ticks off several major differences between now and two years ago . 
Unlike 1987 , interest rates have been falling this year . 
Thus , he concludes , `` This is not a good environment to be fully invested '' in stocks . 
But we came into Friday with a conservative portfolio , so I would look to do some modest buying '' on behalf of clients . `` 
`` I see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion , '' he says . 
`` The explosion of junk bonds and takeovers has lodged a lot of insecure securities in the hands of investors and loaded the corporations that are the objects of takeovers or feared takeovers with huge amounts of debt rather than equity . 
Nevertheless , he says a depression does n't appear likely . 
`` There is more resiliency in the economy at large than we commonly suppose , '' he says . 
`` Companies are still going to buy companies around the world , '' he says . 
Examples are `` Ford looking at Jaguar , BellSouth looking at LIN Broadcasting . '' 
`` The market was up 35 % since -LCB- President -RCB- Bush took office , '' Mr. Gabelli says , so a correction was to be expected . 
He sees `` economic problems , financial problems '' ahead for the U.S. , with a fairly strong possibility of a recession . 
`` Friday you could n't sell dollars , '' he says . 
Mr. Rogers wo n't decide what to do today until he sees how the London and Tokyo markets go . 
Many people now claim to have predicted the 1987 crash . 
Mr. Curzio says what happens now will depend a good deal on the Federal Reserve Board . 
If it promptly cuts the discount rate it charges on loans to banks , he says , `` That could quiet things down . '' 
Renaissance is keeping its money entirely in cash equivalents , primarily U.S. Treasury bills . 
Yes , he did . 
He did repeat those nice platitudes several times as an indication of his support for the Constitution . 
Unfortunately , by my rough guess , he used better than 5,000 words heaping scorn on the witnesses for exercising the Fifth . 
He sandwiched his praise of constitutional meat between large loaves of bilious commentary . 
As your editorial rightly pointed out , Samuel Pierce , former HUD secretary , and Lance Wilson , Mr. Pierce 's former aide , `` are currently being held up to scorn for taking the Fifth Amendment . 
3 . That his `` committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at HUD . 
Apparently , their verdict is in . 
Apparently , their verdict is in . Right now they 're pursuing evidence . 
Of course , Mr. Lantos doth protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change . 
No doubt that 's partially true . 
Everything that Mr. Lantos says in his letter is partially true . 
But if his explanation of motivation is true , why is his investigation so oriented as to identify criminal activity ? Why not simply questions designed to identify sources and causes of waste and inefficiency ? Such as , what happened when Congress wanted to know about $ 400 toilet seats or whatever they supposedly cost ? 
No , to my mind , the Journal did not `` defend sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence-peddling and abuse of the public trust ... '' 
The system is the problem , not an individual member . 
Individuals can always have their hands slapped . 
But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to American notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency -LRB- and , yes , maybe criminality -RRB- within HUD could possibly generate . 
The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person `` shall be compelled , in any criminal case , to be a witness against himself . '' 
Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter . 
He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution . 
Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . 
Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . 
Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce 's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime . 
Professor Kolb says the original study , titled Friday the 13th , Part VII , was published tongue-in-cheek . 
`` We could n't get dealers to answer their phones , '' said Robert King , senior vice president of OTC trading at Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta . 
Nonetheless , the Nasdaq Composite Index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever , diving 14.90 , or 3 % , to 467.29 . 
Most of the complaints about unanswered phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors . 
Peter DaPuzzo , head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton , declared : `` It was the last hour of trading on a Friday . 
There were too many phones ringing and too many things happening to expect market makers to be as efficient as robots . 
James Tarantino , head of OTC trading at Hambrecht & Quist in San Francisco , said , `` It was just like two years ago . 
Market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur . 
On days like Friday , that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to . 
When selling is so frenzied , prices fall steeply and fast . 
Mr. Tarantino of Hambrecht & Quist said some prices fell without trades taking place , as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares . 
So , while OTC companies incurred losses on Friday , trading officials said the damage was n't as bad as it was in 1987 . 
`` Two years ago we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big culprit . 
Tony Cecin , head of equity trading at Piper , Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis , said that Piper Jaffray actually made money on Friday . 
`` The pace of trading was orderly , '' he said . 
In the past , the OTC market thrived on a firm base of small-investor participation . 
But they are worried . 
Mr. Cecin of Piper Jaffray says some action from government policy makers would allay investor fears . 
Shearson 's Mr. DaPuzzo said retail investors nervously sold stock Friday and never returned to bargain-hunt . 
`` We had a good amount of selling from institutions , but not as much panic , '' Mr. DaPuzzo said . 
Nasdaq 's biggest stocks were hammered . 
The Nasdaq 100 Index of the largest nonfinancial issues , including the big OTC technology issues , tumbled 4.2 % , or 19.76 , to 449.33 . 
McCaw lost 8 % , or 3 1\/2 , to 40 . 
McCaw lost 8 % , or 3 1\/2 , to 40 . LIN Broadcasting , dropped 5 1\/2 , or 5 % , to 107 1\/2 . 
On a day when negative takeover-related news did n't sit well with investors , Commercial Intertech , a maker of engineered metal parts , said Haas & Partners advised it that it does n't plan to pursue its previously reported $ 27.50-a-share bid to buy the company . 
The issues of companies with ties to the junk bond market also tumbled Friday . 
Among other OTC issues , Intel , dropped 2 1\/8 to 33 7\/8 
Among other OTC issues , Intel , dropped 2 1\/8 to 33 7\/8 ; Laidlaw Transportation lost 1 1\/8 to 19 1\/2 
Among other OTC issues , Intel , dropped 2 1\/8 to 33 7\/8 ; Laidlaw Transportation lost 1 1\/8 to 19 1\/2 ; the American depositary receipts of Jaguar were off 1\/4 to 10 1\/4 
Among other OTC issues , Intel , dropped 2 1\/8 to 33 7\/8 ; Laidlaw Transportation lost 1 1\/8 to 19 1\/2 ; the American depositary receipts of Jaguar were off 1\/4 to 10 1\/4 ; MCI Communications slipped 2 1\/4 to 43 1\/2 
These rate indications are n't directly comparable 
To be sure , big investors might put away their checkbooks in a hurry if stocks open sharply lower today . 
Mr. Rogers spent half his cash on hand Friday for `` our favorite stocks that have fallen apart . '' 
Denver-based portfolio manager James Craig was n't daunted when Friday 's rout shaved $ 40 million from the value of the $ 752 million Janus Fund he oversees . 
Other money managers also opened their wallets . 
`` I was buying at the close -LRB- Friday -RRB- and I 'll be buying again because I know we 're getting good value , '' said Frederick A. Moran , president of Moran Asset Management Inc. , Greenwich , Conn . 
Unlike mutual funds , which can be forced to sell stockholdings when investors rush to withdraw money , big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock . 
`` The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long-term holders , and that they ca n't react to short-term events , good or bad , '' said Stephen L. Nesbitt , senior vice president for the pension consultants Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica , Calif . 
Stocks , as measured by the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , have been stellar performers this year , rising 27.97 % before Friday 's plunge , excluding dividends . 
Mr. Awad , however , worries that the market `` could go down 800 or 900 points in the next few days . 
It can happen before you can turn around . '' 
He said he discerns many parallels with 1987 , including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading . 
Not really insurance , this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of S&P futures contracts . 
Even without portfolio insurance , market conditions were grim Friday , money managers said . 
Mr. Weisman predicts stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days before declining again , trapping more investors . 
Meanwhile , Friday brought a reprieve for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally . 
All that now has changed . 
`` We 're ahead for the year because of Friday , '' said the firm 's Kurt Feshbach . 
The FDA has said it presented evidence it uncovered to the company indicating that Bolar substituted the brand-name product for its own to gain government approval to sell generic versions of Macrodantin . 
Should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense , ASKO will then ask the court to overturn such a vote-diluting maneuver recently deployed by Koninklijke Ahold NV . 
A spokesman for Ahold said his company is confident of its own position and the propriety of the preferred-share issue . 
`` There are some very significant issues out there , such as the fiscal deficit , the trade deficit , our relations with Japan , that have to be the subject of major initiatives , '' he said in an interview . 
`` I 'd like to see that initiative , and I have n't . 
-- By 11:59 p.m. tonight , President Bush must order $ 16 billion of automatic , across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply with the Gramm-Rudman budget law . 
The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit-cutting bill . 
-- For the last two weeks , the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged in a semi-public battle over international economic policy . 
The administration has been trying to push the dollar lower 
The administration has been trying to push the dollar lower ; the Fed has been resisting . 
And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines , which includes a big stake by British Airways PLC . 
In many ways , the backdrop to Friday 's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October 1987 's 508-point crash . 
Then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold . 
But , barring further drops in the market this week , a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year . 
One of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that , as everyone learned in 1987 , the economy and the market can survive a one-day 508-point tumble . 
`` Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of 1929 , that we were looking at a recession , '' Rep. Panetta said yesterday in an interview . 
`` That did not happen . 
In that case , there will be plenty of blame to go around . 
During last week 's maneuverings on the deficit-cutting bill and the capital-gains issue , there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds . 
When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation , Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee , hailed it . 
The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met , estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ 11.0 billion . 
But some players were quick to seize the moment . 
Before the sun had set on Friday , Richard Rahn , the supply-side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains . 
`` And I think institutions are going to come in and buy ... 
I 'm going to hold on . 
Some evinced an optimism that had been rewarded when they did n't flee the market in 1987 . 
`` Oh , I bet it 'll be up 50 points on Monday , '' said Lucy Crump , a 78-year-old retired housewife in Lexington , Ky . 
In fact , some of the association 's members -- long-term , buy-and-hold investors -- welcomed the drop in prices . 
`` We hope to take advantage of it , '' said John Snyder , a member of a Los Angeles investors ' club . 
Marc Perkins , a Tampa , Fla. , investment banker , said the market drop is one of `` a tremendous number of signs that the leveraged take-out era is ending . 
Sara Albert , a 34-year-old Dallas law student , says she 's generally skittish about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it . 
`` I have this feeling that it 's built on sand , '' she says , that the market rises `` but there 's no foundation to it . '' 
Others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand . 
`` We all assumed October '87 was a one-time shot , '' said San Francisco attorney David Greenberg . 
`` We told the little guy it could only happen once in a lifetime , come on back . 
Mr. Greenberg got out just before the 1987 crash and , to his regret , never went back even as the market soared . 
Still , he adds : `` We ca n't have this kind of thing happen very often . 
When the little guy gets frightened , the big guys hurt badly . 
Small investors have tiptoed back into the market following Black Monday , but mostly through mutual funds . 
Discount brokerage customers `` have been in the market somewhat but not whole hog like they were two years ago , '' says Leslie Quick Jr. , chairman of the Quick & Reilly discount brokerage firm . 
Hugo Quackenbush , senior vice president at Charles Scwhab Corp. , says Schwab customers `` have been neutral to cautious recently about stocks . '' 
But it 's not only the stock market that has some small investors worried . 
And , finally , there were the gloaters . 
`` I got out in 1987 . Everything , '' said Pascal Antori , an Akron , Ohio , plumbing contractor who was visiting Chicago and stopped by Fidelity Investments ' LaSalle Street office . 
`` Are you kidding ! 
Compaq 's series of notebooks extends a trend toward downsizing in the personal computer market . 
Compaq 's notebooks , by contrast , may be the first in their weight class not to skimp on features found in much bigger machines . 
Analysts say they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market -- and they 're priced aggressively at $ 2,400 to $ 5,000 . 
In recent months , Compaq 's competition , including Zenith , Toshiba Corp. , Tandy Corp. and NEC Corp. all have introduced portables that weigh approximately the same and that are called notebooks -- perhaps misleadingly . 
One analyst , noting that most such machines are about two inches thick , takes exception to the name . 
That ca n't be said of the $ 2,400 notepad computer introduced a few weeks ago by GRiD Systems Corp. , a unit of Tandy . 
Instead of a keyboard , it features a writing surface , an electronic pen and the ability to `` read '' block printing . 
Palmtops are n't far behind . 
At stake is what Mike Swavely , Compaq 's president of North America operations , calls `` the Holy Grail of the computer industry '' -- the search for `` a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere . '' 
The market is so new , nobody knows yet how big it can be . 
`` I 've had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is , '' says Tom Humphries , director of marketing for GRiD . 
`` Whether it 's $ 5 billion or $ 3.5 billion , it does n't matter . 
Consider the growth of portables , which now comprise 12 % of all personal computer sales . 
Responding to that demand , however , has led to a variety of compromises . 
A Poquet spokesman , for example , criticizes the Atari Portfolio because it requires three batteries while the Poquet needs only two . 
Both palmtops are dismissed by notebook makers , who argue that they 're too small -- a problem Poquet also encountered in focus groups , admits Gerry Purdy , director of marketing . 
Despite the sniping , few question the inevitability of the move to small machines that do n't make compromises . 
Compaq is already taking aim at Zenith 's market share . 
Rod Canion , Compaq 's president and chief executive officer , notes pointedly that Zenith 's $ 2,000 MinisPort uses an `` unconventional '' two-inch floppy disk , whereas Compaq 's new machines use the more common 3 1\/2-inch disk . 
John P. Frank , president of Zenith Data Systems , simply shrugs off such criticism , noting that 3 1\/2-inch floppies were also `` unconventional '' when they first replaced five-inch disks . 
Analysts do n't see it that way . 
Analysts do n't see it that way . `` I ca n't imagine that you 'll talk to anyone who wo n't tell you this is dynamite for Compaq and a stopper for everyone else , '' says Gene Talsky , president of Professional Marketing Management Inc . 
Adds Bill Lempesis , senior industry analyst for DataQuest , a high-technology market research firm : `` We basically think that these are very hot products . 
Toshiba 's line of portables , for example , features the T-1000 , which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory , and the T-1600 , which also uses a 286 microprocessor , but which weighs almost twice as much and is three times the size . 
And among the issues hitting new highs were Detroit Edison Co. and Niagara Mohawk Power Corp . 
Of course , many more issues -- 93 -- hit new lows . 
These included International Business Machines Corp. , which during Friday 's session traded below $ 100 a share for the first time since June 1984 . 
Meanwhile , two initial public offerings braved the cascading market in their maiden day of national over-the-counter trading Friday . 
The No. 2 auto maker disclosed last month that it wants to buy as much as 15 % of the British luxury-car maker , the maximum allowed under current United Kingdom government restrictions . 
General Motors Corp. said it had discussed the possibility of a joint venture with Jaguar before Ford began buying shares . 
Typically , a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below 75 % of its original value . 
But some big brokerage firms said they do n't expect major problems as a result of margin calls . 
Hugo Quackenbush , senior vice president at Charles Schwab Corp. , the San Francisco-based discount brokerage firm , said he did n't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for Schwab customers . 
He said Schwab had increased margin requirements `` so customers have more of a cushion . '' 
`` I can not see how this news by Hertz and Avis can not benefit Budget 's programs , '' said Bob Wilson , Budget 's vice president , marketing planning . 
This year has been difficult for both Hertz and Avis , said Charles Finnie , car-rental industry analyst at Alex . Brown & Sons . 
`` I have every intention of making this the best possible show and having it run one hour is the best way to it , '' said Rod Perth , who was named vice president of late night entertainment in August . 
The show , despite a promising start , has slipped badly in the weekly ratings as compiled by A.C. Nielsen Co. , finishing far below `` Tonight '' on NBC , a unit of General Electric Co. , and `` Nightline '' on ABC-TV , a unit of Capital Cities\/ABC Inc . 
Tandem expects to report the full results for the quarter next week . 
That will spur Tandem 's growth . 
But Mr. Treybig questions whether that will be enough to stop Tandem 's first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from Big Blue 's machines . 
Nevertheless , Tandem faces a variety of challenges , the biggest being that customers generally view the company 's computers as complementary to IBM 's mainframes . 
Do n't jump yet . 
In one wild hour of trading , the market managed to accomplish what the Bush administration has been trying to do , unsuccessfully , for weeks . 
It is forcing the Federal Reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously irrepressible dollar . 
This may sound strangely optimistic . 
After all , until a few years ago , the stock market was viewed as a barometer of the national economy . 
That has changed , partly because the two years following the worst stock-market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable . 
The market seems increasingly disconnected from the rest of the nation . 
Its spasms ca n't be traced to fundamental business conditions , nor do they appear to presage major shifts in the economy . 
Of course , the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive this week . 
Sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth , damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the U.S. now relies for financial sustenance . 
What 's more , although the stock market is far less overvalued today than two years ago , the U.S. economy is weaker . 
Growth is slower . 
Growth is slower . Profits are softer . 
But if the stock market does n't continue to plummet , the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate . 
The Fed , which until Friday had been resisting moves to ease credit , is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets . 
The dollar also began to decline Friday as the stock market 's plunge caused some investors to reassess their desire to invest in the U.S. . 
Treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar 's strength was out of whack with economic fundamentals , threatening to extinguish the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for several years . 
A modest drop in the dollar -- only a modest one , mind you -- would be welcomed by the U.S. . 
Another big difference between 1987 and 1989 is n't so comforting . 
In the third quarter of 1987 , the economy spurted at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 5.3 % . 
The plunge in stock prices `` is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down , '' says economist Lawrence Chimerine of WEFA Group , a Bala Cynwyd , Pa. , forecasting company . 
Consumer spending did drop in the months following Black Monday 1987 -- `` but only slightly and for a short period of time , '' recalls Mr. Zarnowitz , a longtime student of business cycles . 
`` That was offset by strength elsewhere . 
-LCB- The effects -RCB- were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected . 
What 's more , the corporate borrowing binge has n't abated in the past two years . 
The more a company relies on borrowed money , the greater its sensitivity to an economic slowdown . 
A company with a strong balance sheet can withstand an unanticipated storm 
But , in the process , the Fed risks reigniting inflation . 
Even before Friday 's events , Harvard University economist Benjamin Friedman was arguing that the Fed wo n't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets , banks and highly leveraged corporations . 
The biggest threat on the economic horizon right now is n't recession 
A 190-point drop is n't likely to make much of a dent ; multiply that a few times over , though , and it will . 
On the bottom line , the most comforting fact for the economic outlook is that we 've been through this before . 
Two years ago , about the only point of comparison was the 1929 crash and the subsequent Depression . 
The doomsayers had a receptive audience . 
At the very least , the establishment here is taking comfort from the nation 's success in handling the last go-around . 
As Sen. Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- observed yesterday , `` The Fed avoided a meltdown last time .
