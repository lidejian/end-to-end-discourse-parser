This drew criticism from sports commentators such as Billy Packer , who felt it was more appropriate to give at-large bids to schools from major conferences , like the Big East , Big 10 , or ACC .

Just like the Cross City Tunnel , the community suffered because the contract failed to protect the quality of service delivery . '' 
Dr Kaye said that the Auditor General has `` cast a very large shadow '' over the government 's claimed savings from the PPP program . 
Any attempt to say that private sector control is cheaper is now fraught with danger , '' `` The Auditor General 's report proves that the methodology used by the Government to estimate the costs of public sector provision is highly unreliable and suspect '' said Dr Kaye .

I believe it is appropriate to seek a statutory pardon . '' 
They had argued that Pvt. Farr was suffering from shell shock , he should have not been sent back to the trenches and that the court martial was unfair because it did not take shell shock into consideration . 
After a High Court ruled against a pardon , the family appealed to the Defence Secretary for a review of the case . 
In May 2005 , a judge opined that there was `` room for argument '' that they had been wrongly refused a conditional posthumous pardon . 
A further hearing scheduled for October 2005 was delayed while Defence Secretary John Reid reconsidered the case .

I have always argued that my father 's refusal to rejoin the front line , described in the court martial as resulting from cowardice , was in fact the result of shell shock , and I believe that many other soldiers suffered from this , not just my father , '' Mrs. Harris said , and hoped that `` others who had brave relatives who were shot by their own side will now get the pardons they equally deserve .

Politicians world-wide are jumping on the ` green ' bandwagon , but , if they want popular support , they 'd better be sure that this is not simply the ` new witchcraft ' . 
She alleges that `` authorities on climate science say that the climate system is far too complex for modest reductions in one of the thousands of factors involved in climate change -LRB- i.e. carbon emissions -RRB- to have a predictable effect in magnitude , or even direction . '' 
About the economic models , upon which Stern relied for his projections , her experience was that forecasting just two or three years ahead was usually wrong . 
She described the problem of drawing conclusions from combining scientific and economic models as ` monumentally complex ' . 
She doubted whether international cooperation was really possible . 
She concluded that she thought that this Review was designed to cloak the motives of a government that wanted some moral justification for increasing taxation on fuels . 
`` The Asia-Pacific Partnership includes countries that represent about half of the world 's emissions , energy use , GDP -LRB- gross domestic product -RRB- and population , and is an important initiative that engages , for the first time , the key greenhouse-gas emitting countries in the Asia-Pacific region , '' Mr Howard said in a statement .

Bush acknowledged that he has `` strong desire to work ... on a post-Kyoto agreement . '' 
He told reporters that : `` The United States can serve as a bridge between some nations who believe that now is the time to come up with a set goal and those who are reluctant to participate in the dialogue . 
We all can make major strides , and yet there wo n't be a reduction until China and India are participants . '' 
At the G8 summit she said : `` I think we all know that the goals agreed by the European Union can not be accepted by the entire world . '' 
He told reporters yesterday : `` We need quantifiable targets in the final text . 
President Bush has made a first effort , but we need to set ourselves targets to clearly show the determination of the G8 to act and to obtain results . 
If we do n't act now , it will be too late to avoid a disaster .

Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi recognised that `` the American president has made comments in the last few days that have been more open than in the past . '' 
He believes a global agreement to follow Kyoto is needed , possibly by 2009 . 
He stressed that , as this was a problem created by all nations , affecting everyone , it had to be tackled within the UN-framework , and that agreements made by only a number of states would fall short of what is needed .

The university staff worried that `` Roberts risked the non-profit status of the university by insisting '' students work as volunteers for Miller 's mayoral campaign . 
In May 2006 , after the IRS contacted ORU about its involvement in Miller 's campaign , Brooker said he was told to `` fall on the sword '' while taking `` full and total blame . '' 
This would have required covering up the directives made by Roberts . 
Days after the three professors brought this to the attention of the school , they were fired by Stephanie Cantese , Richard Robert 's sister-in-law . 
The items , which were beneficial to the Roberts family , were not recovered and though Richard was confronted , he took no action .

The cases do not always include enough evidence , and for this as well as other reasons the schools , courts , state governments , and federal governments can not be sure that they are keeping sexual deviants out of teaching . 
When sexual misconduct is reported , teachers , administrators and some parents frequently can not , either subconsciously or consciously , recognize the warning signs of a crime . 
The accused are often popular with students and parents , and are widely perceived as good teachers . 
In nearly 90 percent of the cases , the offenders are male . 
While certain educators were accused of sexual misconduct in school , others were cited for abuse that occurred after hours and did not always involve one of their own students . 
At least 446 of the cases uncovered by the AP involved educators with multiple victims . 
In schools , fellow teachers often ignore the abuse or feel they can not help . 
School administrators cut backdoor deals to sidestep lawsuits or bad press . 
It is difficult for states to share necessary information about those accused of misconduct and allows some to find classroom jobs in other states . 
According to a New York State Education Department report , the number of `` moral misconduct '' accusations against educators in New York has doubled in five years . 
In 2005 , 134 cases of `` moral misconduct '' were reported involving teachers and other school employees , as compared to just 70 cases in 2001 . 
Florida proved about the same as New York .

The study said that rising levels of CO2 , the main greenhouse gas blamed for climate change , threaten to accelerate global warming . 
The study attributes the change in CO2 levels to increased use of fossil fuels and a decline in the amount of gas being absorbed by the oceans and land . 
The rate has increased 35 percent more than scientists had anticipated based on economic growth , according to Corinne Le Quere , one of the paper 's authors . 
`` One is that we are not as efficient at using CO2 as we had anticipated , and the second cause is that it appears that the CO2 sinks are weakening . '' 
`` For 30 years we were becoming more efficient at using CO2 for producing energy and wealth , and this has completely stalled since 2000 , '' Le Quere said , adding that increased use of coal by developing countries such as China and India was partially to blame . 
Most climate models do not account for a weakening of CO2 sinks , Le Quere said . 
: namely that concentrations of CO2 are increasing at much higher rates than previously expected and this is in spite of the Kyoto Protocol that is designed to hold them down in western countries , '' said Kevin Trenberth , the head of the Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research and a lead author of the 2007 assessment report of the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -LRB- IPCC -RRB- . 
`` There 's quite a significant difference from what was forecast , '' she said . `` It 's rather scary and the IPCC scenarios are , therefore , rather too optimistic -- as if they were n't bleak enough already . 
The whole thing is likely to mean mitigation is rather more difficult than was thought . '' 
The force of the accident , which occurred near Mehrabpur , about 250 miles from Karachi , was such that two were completely destroyed and the rails were severely damaged .
