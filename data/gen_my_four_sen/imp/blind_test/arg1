David Ford , the leader of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland also noted , `` History will judge whether Ian Paisley will be remembered for 40 years of saying no or one year of saying probably .

203 hospitalizations have been linked to the outbreak . 
Nearly half of the reported illnesses were in Texas and New Mexico .

The CDC is in the process of investigating the outbreak and trying to identify the contamination 's point of origin .

`` There are still no results , '' Steele says . 
`` There are still no results , '' Steele says . `` The salability of that produce in two to three days is gone . 
We ceased harvesting . 
Steele , like others in the produce industry , believes that the FDA should be focusing on processed produce instead of fresh produce . 
`` Their methodology is backward , '' he says . 
`` The FDA is reaching for answers . 
Still , the FDA and the CDC consider the testing of fresh jalapeños and other fresh produce a high priority .

Unprecedented worldwide financial turmoil has inevitably placed great challenges before the F1 community . 
The Fota teams have further agreed upon a substantial voluntary cost reduction that provides a sustainable model for the future . In particular , the manufacturer teams have provided assistance to the independent teams , a number of which would probably not be in the sport today without the Fota initiatives .

West Papuan refugees may face death if deported Refugee rights advocates and Australian Parliamentarians on Christmas Island have expressed alarm at the Indonesian Government 's direct request to Prime Minister John Howard for the return of 43 Papuan asylum seekers , who arrived on Cape York by boat on January 18th . 
`` The people have escaped ... because their lives are at risk , '' he said . 
`` Their fathers have been killed , one of them was in jail for a number of years himself , and this is the reality of the situation in West Papua - so no way should they go back 
Mr Wesley-Smith says they have legitimate claims for refugee status . 
`` There 's evidence that some have been mistreated and tortured and they 're a cohesive group and strongly politically motivated , and that there is no way that they would be seen as a group to be sent back 
According to The Melbourne Age newspaper , an Immigration source said the refugees had a `` very strong case '' for refugee status . 
`` Some of what has come out of the interviews has been absolutely heart-wrenching , '' the source said . 
Under the control of the Indonesian military , an estimated 100,000 West Papuans have lost their lives over the last four decades . 
She said verification and interviews by Australian authorities were `` standard procedure '' and valid for anybody arriving in the country without official documents . 
She said the two governments have had good relations since the Bali bombing in October 2002 and the tsunami in December 2004 . 
Australia 's borders are protected by mandatory detention legislation . 
The Australian government detains all persons entering the country by boat without a valid visa , including children .

This year held the Patriots ' first NCAA Tournament game victory , where they beat Michigan State -LRB- No. 6 seed -RRB- and the University of North Carolina -LRB- No. 3 seed -RRB- in the first two rounds . 
Although GMU lost to the University of North Carolina - Wilmington in the CAA Championship bid , the NCAA selection committee awarded the team an at-large bid . 
This drew criticism from sports commentators such as Billy Packer , who felt it was more appropriate to give at-large bids to schools from major conferences , like the Big East , Big 10 , or ACC .

`` The book does not contain any signs of extremism and does not incite hatred on ethnic , religious or any other grounds . On the contrary , the book , written in the commentary tradition of Bengali Vaishnavism , one of the most popular branches of Hinduism , is considered sacred by a section of believers '' , the scholars emphasized , warning that the continued trial of the Hindu scripture in Russia is `` driving a wedge in Russian-Indian relations . '' 
Similar concerns were voiced earlier at an all-Russian conference at Tomsk State University titled `` Bhagavad Gita in history and modern society '' , where scholars expressed perplexity at the prosecutor 's move to declare a translation of the Hindu scripture extremist . 
Speaking at the conference , Irina Glushkova , chief researcher of the Indian Research Center at the Oriental Studies Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences , stressed that `` Bhagavad Gita As It Is '' has the right to exist as any other commentary or scripture . 
NSW govt to rebuild high school with private funding New South Wales minister for Education and Training , Carmel Tebbutt told parliament that Kelso High School , which was destroyed by fire on August 18 , 2005 , will be rebuilt under the NSW government 's New Schools Public Private Partnerships -LRB- PPP -RRB- program . 
The announcement follows Member for Bathurst , Gerard Martin 's statement to parliament on September 14 , 2005 that the government would be rebuilding the school at a cost of $ 18 to $ 25 million . 
Australian Greens education spokesperson , John Kaye , said that problems were already emerging with the PPP program in NSW . 
In March 2006 , it was revealed that the government had to negotiate an exit strategy so that after school hours child care could be provided . 
In a media release provided to Wikinews , Dr Kaye said , `` Yet another flaw in a NSW Public Private Partnership -LRB- PPP -RRB- has been uncovered . 
Dr Kaye also pointed out that an Auditor general 's report found alarming evidence that the basis for PPP in NSW could be based on unreliable financial models . 
`` It appears that the NSW government does not know with any degree of certainty how much it would cost to perform the same function in the public sector .

Pvt. Farr 's family have fought for 14 years to obtain a pardon , saying Farr 's refusal to fight was a direct result of the mental stress caused by his experience in the trenches . 
In June 2004 , Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon refused to grant a pardon to Pvt. Farr , but the family sought a judicial review . 
After a High Court ruled against a pardon , the family appealed to the Defence Secretary for a review of the case . 
In May 2005 , a judge opined that there was `` room for argument '' that they had been wrongly refused a conditional posthumous pardon . 
Relatives of many soldiers convicted of desertion or cowardice have been calling for pardons since 1990 when the Public Record Office declassified case documents . 
In 1993 , John Major rejected an appeal for a pardon , while John Reid , Armed Forces Minister in July 1998 , refused a request for all executed soldiers to be pardoned . 
He said that 90 years after the events , the evidence does n't exist to assess cases individually . 
Pvt. Harry Farr was from Kensington in London and enrolled in the West Yorkshire Regiment , serving in France for two years . 
He saw fighting at Neuve-Chappelle , where his battalion was shelled repeatedly . 
In May 1915 , he collapsed with shell shock and was evacuated to Boulogne . 
He returned to see action in the Battle of Somme . 
Medical evidence presented at the court martial and found later showed that he was treated many times for being `` sick with nerves '' and `` shell shock '' . 
He was found guilty of `` misbehaving before the enemy in such a manner as to show cowardice 
An Army chaplain who witnessed his execution wrote to his widow , Gertie Batstone `` A finer soldier never lived '' and that Pvt. Farr had refused to wear a blindfold during the execution , the `` Independent '' newspaper reported . 
After being informed of the Secretary 's decision , Farr 's granddaughter Janet Booth told the BBC `` We do n't know if it 's a full or a conditional pardon yet . 
Now aged ninety-three , she said on learning of the decision , `` I 'm overwhelmed . 
I prayed that it would happen in my lifetime but I never realised really that it would . 
`` I am so relieved that this ordeal is now over and I can be content knowing that my father 's memory is intact . 
Bathurst mayor , Norm Mann said despite Brock having never lived in Bathurst , he was an honorary citizen . 
`` Although he is not a local resident and has never lived here , Peter Brock was very much an honorary citizen of Bathurst and has over his career had a significant impact on the lives of many people in this community 
The mayor promised that his council would host a fitting tribute to Mr Brock . 
Mr Mann 's sentiment has been echoed by chairman of V8 Supercars Australia Tony Cochrane . 
Mr Cochrane said Bathurst would be the most appropriate place for a tribute to the motor racing icon . 
In a statement , Mr Cochrane said `` The most befitting place for a tribute is Bathurst .

Nigel Farage , leader of the UK Independence Party , questions the assertions that there is scientific consensus on global warming . 
At best , he said , there is uncertainty . 
Ruth Lea , Director of the Centre for Policy Studies , also questions the notion that there is a ` scientific consensus ' over global warming . 
She alleges that `` authorities on climate science say that the climate system is far too complex for modest reductions in one of the thousands of factors involved in climate change -LRB- i.e. carbon emissions -RRB- to have a predictable effect in magnitude , or even direction . '' 
About the economic models , upon which Stern relied for his projections , her experience was that forecasting just two or three years ahead was usually wrong . 
She described the problem of drawing conclusions from combining scientific and economic models as ` monumentally complex ' .

Post-Kyoto agreement is subject of G8 debate Leaders from the 7 richest industrialised countries and Russia will have to deal with climate issues at the 33rd G8 summit in Heiligendamm , Germany . 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel , at the G8 summit yesterday , said the two main topics were climate change and combating poverty in Africa . 
She said her first talks with president Bush were good , and added : `` I trust that we will work out joint positions on that . '' 
President George W. Bush finds himself in a position between the pressure from France and Germany , but on the other hand he wants to urge countries like India and China to join climate efforts . 
He told reporters that : `` The United States can serve as a bridge between some nations who believe that now is the time to come up with a set goal and those who are reluctant to participate in the dialogue . 
When asked about the U.S. plans , Merkel said in a television interview that she did n't expect the differences to disappear overnight . 
The new President of France , Nicolas Sarkozy , wants the U.S. to increase their efforts on climate issues . 
It is an extremely important point and I intend to talk to the president of the United States about it as early as this evening . 
President Bush has made a first effort , but we need to set ourselves targets to clearly show the determination of the G8 to act and to obtain results . 
If we do n't act now , it will be too late to avoid a disaster . 
A spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin called the U.S. plans to deal with global warming `` very pragmatic and interesting . '' 
President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso , at the G8 summit , said he also thought the E.U. was taking a leading role in the climate debate by influencing the position of countries like the U.S. and China . 
He believes a global agreement to follow Kyoto is needed , possibly by 2009 .

Poll shows American youth more politically active , socially liberal Younger Americans may be more receptive to traditionally liberal social policy than their parents , according to a recent poll conducted by the New York Times , CBS News , and MTV . 
Optimism about the outcome of the war in Iraq was higher among the young , with 51 percent of those surveyed predicting a successful outcome , although 87 percent opposed the institution of a draft . 
In stark contrast , younger Americans expressed a generally pessimistic attitude about their future personally and the direction of the country in general . 
Despite differences on social policy , some similarities emerged in the poll . 
Voter turnout among the young has historically lagged turnout rates for all adults , although 2004 saw sharp increases in young voter participation .

Police examined the scene and checked other washrooms in the facility for related threats , but found none . 
The washroom is closed and police are guarding it .

Tim Brooker , one of the former professors suing ORU , was employed by ORU starting 2001 when he was recruited by the Republican National Committee -LRB- RNC -RRB- `` in an effort to further Republican efforts . '' 
Specifically , Roberts is accused of making of illegal donations to current Tulsa County Commissioner Randi Miller , a Republican candidate , in her race for Tulsa mayor . 
The university staff worried that `` Roberts risked the non-profit status of the university by insisting '' students work as volunteers for Miller 's mayoral campaign . 
In May 2006 , after the IRS contacted ORU about its involvement in Miller 's campaign , Brooker said he was told to `` fall on the sword '' while taking `` full and total blame . '' 
This would have required covering up the directives made by Roberts . 
In addition , one of Roberts ' children was video-taped vandalizing and removing athletic department equipment from ORU property . 
John Hagee , an ORU Board of Regents member , said the university 's executive board `` is conducting a full and thorough investigation . '' 
Furthermore , the court filing quoted Roberts as saying `` if a Regent appears to give me trouble , I remove him . 
I stack the deck ... '' On Wednesday , Roberts said , `` This suit has been filed by an attorney who has , over the years , filed many suits against Oral Roberts University ... and he has lost every suit that he has filed against the university . '' 
In response , Gary Richardson , representing the plaintiffs , noted he was involved in only one other lawsuit involving ORU , concerning its hospital building , and it was settled before trial . 
According to The New York Times sources , the Bush administration was divided at the time over whether to support the Israeli attack . 
Investigations suggest that many cases of sexual abuse are never reported , and those that are reported often do not lead to punishment for the offender . 
Certain academic studies estimate that only about ten percent of victimized children report sexual abuse of any kind to a person who can take action to help them . 
The cases that the AP found were those of all types of educators -- teachers , school psychologists , and even principals and superintendents . 
The accused are often popular with students and parents , and are widely perceived as good teachers . 
In nearly 90 percent of the cases , the offenders are male . 
While certain educators were accused of sexual misconduct in school , others were cited for abuse that occurred after hours and did not always involve one of their own students . 
However , while the AP found attempts to stop particular offenders , it also discovered a firm resistance towards identifying and preventing abuse . 
In schools , fellow teachers often ignore the abuse or feel they can not help . 
The dearth of information is evidence of a system of disciplining teachers that , nationwide , is often cloaked in secrecy . 
Another disturbing trend is that cases of misconduct seem to be on the rise in many places . 
According to a New York State Education Department report , the number of `` moral misconduct '' accusations against educators in New York has doubled in five years . 
The AP 's national analysis shows Texas and California with the most sexual misconduct cases , each with two to three times as many cases as New York . 
`` If a child says such-and-such a person , teacher , coach or neighbor is ` weird , ' the parent should not simply dismiss this comment , but have the child explain why the person is weird , '' she said .

Study says carbon dioxide levels rising faster than anticipated The concentration of carbon dioxide -LRB- CO2 -RRB- in the atmosphere is increasing faster than expected , according to a new study published in Tuesday 's edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . 
The study said that rising levels of CO2 , the main greenhouse gas blamed for climate change , threaten to accelerate global warming . 
CO2 emissions have increased by an average of 3.3 percent per year since 2000 , compared with 1.1 percent per year in the 1990s . 
`` The causes of the acceleration are surprising , '' Le Quere said . 
The study attributed approximately half of the unexpected growth to an increase in the carbon intensity of the global economy , a measure of the amount of carbon emissions per unit of economic activity . 
The remaining unexpected growth was attributed to a decline in the ability of the oceans and land to absorb CO2 . 
The study `` raises some very important issues that the public should be aware of 
However , Le Quere suggested that this scenario might be overly optimistic . 
`` It 's rather scary and the IPCC scenarios are , therefore , rather too optimistic -- as if they were n't bleak enough already . 
Fourteen of the sixteen cars that comprised the service were derailed .
