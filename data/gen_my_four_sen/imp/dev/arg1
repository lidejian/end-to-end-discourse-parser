The bill , whose backers include Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill. -RRB- , would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that would n't be counted on the federal budget . 
But the RTC also requires `` working '' capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold , until the assets can be sold separately . 
`` It 's a problem that clearly has to be resolved , '' said David Cooke , executive director of the RTC . 
Absent other working capital , he said , the RTC would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets . 
`` That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means , which seems to me sort of draconian , '' he said . 
Hard on the heels of Friday 's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed , a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message : Keep on investing , the market 's just fine . 
Just days after the 1987 crash , major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors . 
PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night . 
PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night . Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday , and wrote another new ad appearing today . 
It considered running them during tomorrow night 's World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday . 
The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around , when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic . 
Fidelity , for example , prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge . 
`` A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us , '' he says . 
`` To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial . 
It would have been too late to think about on Friday . 
Today 's Fidelity ad goes a step further , encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity . 
Underneath the headline `` Diversification , '' it counsels , `` Based on the events of the past week , all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market 's volatility . '' 
PaineWebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash . 
The new PaineWebber commercial , created with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , features Mary Farrell , one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists , sounding particularly bullish . 
Taped just as the market closed yesterday , it offers Ms. Farrell advising , `` We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle ... . 
`` We 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything , which just drives the prices down further , '' says John Lampe , PaineWebber 's director of advertising . 
`` If you owned it and liked it Friday , the true value has n't changed . '' 
With the market fluctuating and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday , investment firms had to constantly revise their approach . 
But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday , Shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad . 
`` We do n't think at this point anything needs to be said . 
The market seems to be straightening out 
But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective . 
In 1987 , despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms , individuals ran from the market en masse . 
Mr. Eskandarian , who resigned his Della Femina post in September , becomes chairman and chief executive of Arnold . 
Separately , McDonald 's Corp. , Oak Brook , Ill. , named Arnold to handle its estimated $ 4 million cooperative ad account for the Hartford , Conn. , area . 
Baseball , that game of the long haul , is the quintessential sport of the mean , and the mean ol' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend . 
In game two , on a cool Sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn , a lot of the catching up was done by the A 's catcher , Terry Steinbach . 
He hit a 2-0 pitch from Rick Reuschel into the left-field stands in inning four to stretch his team 's lead from 2-1 to a decisive 5-1 , where it stayed . 
So what if Steinbach had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular-season games , and batted in the seventh position of the A 's lineup . 
On Saturday night , quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and , no doubt , future droughts . 
Mark McGwire , the big , red-haired Oakland first baseman , had three hits in four at bats , two more than he 'd had in the five-game Dodger series in which he 'd gone 1-for-17 . 
That he was the A 's winningest pitcher during its American League campaign with a 21-9 mark , plus two wins over Toronto in the playoffs , indicates he may have some evening up coming , but with the way his split-fingered fastball is behaving , that might not be this week . 
The stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs -LRB- 29 of 39 -RRB- that took 2-0 Series leads went on to win it all . 
One might think that the home fans in this Series of the Subway Called BART -LRB- that 's a better name for a public conveyance than `` Desire , '' do n't you think ? -RRB- would have been ecstatic over the proceedings , but they observe them in relative calm . 
A few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams . 
`` I 'm for the Giants today , but only because they lost yesterday . 
I love 'em both . 
I choose to believe it 's the latter , although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here , including the A 's and Giants , is originally from somewhere else . 
Anyway , the A 's gave you a lot of heroes to root for . 
In the opening game , besides Steinbach and Stewart , there was Walt Weiss , a twiggy-looking , second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery . 
Such is his reputation among the East Bay Bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season , the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph . 
An A 's co-hero of the second game was Rickey Henderson , who exemplifies the hot side of the hot-cold equation . 
He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits , seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats , and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday , along with walking , stealing a base and scoring a run . 
They combined for 25 hits , six home runs and 24 runs batted in in the five games against the Cubs . 
It 's that last set of numbers , as much as anything else , that gives the Giants hope in the Series games to come . 
`` I believe in the law of averages , '' declared San Francisco batting coach Dusty Baker after game two . 
But the old Dodger slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side . 
`` When it goes , you never know when you 'll get it back , '' he said . 
But per-share profit dropped only 2 % to $ 1.23 a share from $ 1.26 a share , as the company continued its stock buy-back plan .

At Jefferies & Co. , J. Francis Palamara did n't reach the office until 5:30 a.m. , but then he had been up most of the night at home . 
`` I had calls all night long from the States , '' he said . 
For many of London 's securities traders , it was a day that started nervously in the small hours . 
And it left mixed signals for London . 
Tokyo stocks closed off a significant but less-than-alarming 1.8 % on thin volume 
The Jefferies office , a branch of the Los Angeles-based firm , played it conservatively , seeking to avoid risk . 
`` This is not the sort of market to have a big position in , '' said David Smith , who heads trading in all non-U.S. stocks . 
`` All the takeover stocks -- Scottish & Newcastle , B.A.T , DRG -- are getting pretty well pasted this morning , '' Mr. Smith said . 
Seconds later , a 7,500-share `` sell '' order for Scottish & Newcastle came in . 
For the third time in 15 minutes , a trader next to Mr. Smith left the no-smoking area to have a cigarette . 
`` Because Tokyo did n't collapse , let 's pick up a little stock , '' Mr. Smith said . 
He targeted 7,500 shares of Reuters and punched a button to call up on his screen other dealers ' price quotes . 
`` When I want to buy , they run from you -- they keep changing their prices , '' Mr. Smith said . 
`` It 's very frustrating . '' 
He was right . 
By midday , the London market was in full retreat . 
`` It 's falling like a stone , '' said Danny Linger , a pit trader who was standing outside the London International Financial Futures Exchange . 
Only half the usual lunchtime crowd gathered at the tony Corney & Barrow wine bar on Old Broad Street nearby . 
`` France opened the limit down , off at least 10 % if you could calculate the index , which you could n't , '' Mr. Clark , the Shearson trader , said early in the afternoon . 
`` Spain is down 10 % and suspended , Sweden 's down 8 % , Norway 11 % . 
In the center of the trading floor , chief trader Roger Streeter and two colleagues scrambled for the telephones as soon as the New York market opened -- plummeting more than 60 points in the first few minutes . 
They saw an opportunity created by the sell-off . 
As Wall Street traders dumped American Depositary Receipts in Jaguar PLC , Mr. Streeter and trader Sam Ruiz bought them to resell in the U.K . 
As Wall Street strengthened , the London trading room went wild . 
As the London market rallied , some wondered whether the weekend of worrying and jitters had been worth it . 
The measure drew criticism from the Bush administration and a parting shot from financier Donald Trump , who yesterday withdrew his takeover bid for AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines . 
Aides both in the House and Senate said the withdrawal of the Trump bid for AMR is n't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation .

And at the company 's Wichita , Kan. , plant , about 2,400 of the 11,700 machinists still are working , Boeing said . 
Dataproducts , which had been seeking a buyer for several months , announced a restructuring plan in September and took itself off the auction block . 
The company 's restructuring includes plans to split into three sectors , to phase out domestic printer manufacturing operations and to sell its New England subsidiary . 
Jack Davis , Dataproducts ' president , chairman and chief executive officer , said the company `` is at a loss to understand DPC 's intentions . '' 
West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said , `` In my view , the stock market will stabilize relatively quickly . 
There may be one or other psychological or technical reactions , but they are n't based on fundamentals . 
Paris , which has been the center of speculation fever in recent weeks , also was hard hit . 
One of the sharpest declines came in the financial center of Europe 's strongest economy . 
The DAX Index of 30 West German blue chips plunged 12.8 % , a one-day record , wiping out the summer 's gains .

`` The beginning was chaotic , '' said Nigel Longley , a broker for Commerzbank AG . 
Institutional investors and bankers , many of whom spent the night before in their offices watching Far Eastern markets , were cautiously optimistic after the mild 1.8 % decline in Tokyo stock prices . 
`` Everybody was still confident , including most institutional investors . 
It was big institutions such as Norwich Union Insurance Group , Scottish Amicable Investment Managers and Standard Life Assurance Co. that spearheaded the rally .

LIN is asking McCaw to clarify its tender offer , which challenges an agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN to merge their cellular-telephone businesses . 
The LIN board said holders may be misled by the provision in the McCaw proposal that `` guarantees '' private market value after five years for the remaining shares . 
McCaw has `` no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain , '' the LIN board said .

At Merrill Lynch , third-period net was $ 41 million , or 34 cents a share , down from $ 65.6 million , or 58 cents a share , a year ago . 
The firm 's drop in net reflected weaker revenue in transactions for its own account -- a decline of 19 % to $ 314.6 million on reduced revenue from trading fixed-income securities .

After the 1987 plunge , markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose . 
The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers 
The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers : If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one hour 
The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers : If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one hour ; if the decline hits 400 points , the exchange will close for an additional two hours . 
It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic . 
What happened Friday was the worst of all worlds . 
The futures exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes , after the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points , or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index . 
Options markets stopped trading in many securities . 
With nowhere else to go , sellers , and particularly program traders , focused all their selling on the New York Stock Exchange . 
Futures trading , however , was halted altogether at 3:45 , after the futures markets had dropped an additional 30 points , which is the daily limit for price declines . 
It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange , the futures markets and the options markets , though physically separate , have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively . 
It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers . 
Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday , but they probably would have made for smoother , less volatile executions . 
It 's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open . 
The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies . 
In many ways , our financial markets are better prepared today to handle a decline than they were two years ago . 
The New York Stock Exchange now has the capacity to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day . 
Telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers , and specialists -- who I believe should stay , despite the urgings of some post-crash critics -- have larger capital positions .

But NAHB support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch 
But NAHB support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch ; over the years the NAHB has backed a host of public programs .

Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past , and inevitably are twisted to the benefit of well-connected developers and lobbyists , as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal , or congressmen . 
Though Mr. Colton says expanding FHA lending would result in `` no cost to the government , '' the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing -LRB- such as low-income -RRB- to the single-family home market would result in a major expense . 
More important , housing programs run by HUD , the VA , and FmHA are awash in red ink . 
The FHA alone lost $ 4.2 billion in fiscal 1988 
The FHA alone lost $ 4.2 billion in fiscal 1988 ; the government 's equity in the agency , essentially its reserve fund , fell to minus $ 2.9 billion . 
The FHA alone lost $ 4.2 billion in fiscal 1988 ; the government 's equity in the agency , essentially its reserve fund , fell to minus $ 2.9 billion . The federal government has had to pump in $ 2.28 billion into the VA housing program since 1984 to keep the fund afloat and the VA requested an additional $ 120 million for the fiscal year just ended . 
In its nicely produced publication `` Where Will Our Children Live ? '' the NAHB does acknowledge that `` of course , the full measure of housing affordability can not be provided by the federal government . '' 
The association , a majority of whose 156,000 members build fewer than 25 units a year , is like many other business lobbies . 
Explains Sheila MacDonald of the National Taxpayers Union : `` It treads in two worlds . 
The builders like the subsidies , but at the same time they tend to be fiscal conservatives in terms of major issues , such as the balanced-budget amendment . '' 
Unfortunately , the organization 's desire for pork tends to override its commitment to overall fiscal responsibility . 
As Mr. Colton of the NAHB acknowledges : `` Government is not going to solve the problem ... . 
The real key is to have the economy working and interest rates down . '' 
More money for HUD will increase the deficit and destabilize the economy ; more money to municipalities that are wrecking their local housing markets will further insulate them from the destructive effects of their policies . 
Setting a date to start treaty negotiations has no legal significance in itself , but could be viewed as an important psychological push . 
The latest crewcut in the equities markets reminds me of the joke T. Boone Pickens tells about the guy who was run over by the parade . 
The ceremonies began Friday afternoon when word spread that the UAL buy-out was collapsing . 
Deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses . 
UAL , which triggered the slide , opened Monday at $ 224 , down about 20 % from Thursday 's close . 
UAL , which triggered the slide , opened Monday at $ 224 , down about 20 % from Thursday 's close . AMR opened Monday at $ 80 , down nearly 20 % from Thursday 's close . 
UAL , which triggered the slide , opened Monday at $ 224 , down about 20 % from Thursday 's close . AMR opened Monday at $ 80 , down nearly 20 % from Thursday 's close . -LRB- Both took further hits yesterday . -RRB- Hilton lost 20 % on Friday ; Paramount lost almost 11 % . 
A careful look reveals that where deal financing has been secured , the target 's stock price was not affected on Friday . 
The market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for Friday 's dramatic march for several weeks . 
The growing financial difficulties of recent high-leverage restructurings or takeovers , such as Resorts International , Integrated Resources , and Campeau 's retailing empire , have cast a pall over the entire market for high-yield securities . 
These are all market excesses -LRB- putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity -RRB- , and what we 've seen is the market reining them in . 
If it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused Gray Friday , what are the implications for policy makers ? 
After all , the stock market 's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken to confirm the anti-debt direction of regulators . 
To the extent that Friday 's sell-off reflected a sudden reappraisal of the excesses of leverage , the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior . 
The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings . 
Yes , the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral , but they rode the tiger up all year . 
The arbitragers and takeover initiatiors got killed on Gray Friday , while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily . 
If you identify with the besieged managers , you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington . 
Although the average citizen is probably not harmed too much from Washington 's rhetorical war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial leveraging , actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm . 
Tokyo share prices rebounded Tuesday morning , with the Nikkei index of 225 selected stocks rising 618.69 points to close the morning session at 35087.38 .

Among other Asian and Pacific markets , Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses , with the Kuala Lumpur composite index in Malaysia falling 11.5 % and Singapore 's Straits Times Industrial Index down 10 % . 
Major indexes declined more than 8 % in Australia and New Zealand and 6.5 % in Hong Kong . 
`` It 's pure psychology , '' said William Au Yeung , an account executive for Drexel Burnham Lambert -LRB- HK -RRB- Ltd. in Hong Kong . 
`` Singapore took the hit because when people want to get out , they tend to go where the liquidity is , '' said Elizabeth Hambrecht , a regional analyst with Baring Securities -LRB- Hong Kong -RRB- Ltd . 
In Hong Kong , the Hang Seng Index fell 180.60 to finish at 2601.70 . 
Richard Chenevix-Trench , a director at Hong Kong-based Baring International Fund Managers Ltd. , said the market probably has n't hit bottom yet but is close . 
London 's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index , the most closely watched market barometer , ended at its intraday high of 2163.4 , down 70.5 , or 3.2 % .

Prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange tumbled in heavy trading . 
Retail investors dumped holdings on a massive scale , pushing some blue-chip shares down as much as 20 % . 
Frank Lloyd Wright is reported to have said once that if you tipped the world on its side , everything loose would end up in California . 
We 've always thought that Mr. Wright underestimated California 's vitality , but maybe the state 's la-la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place . 
The initiative is based largely on the wish-lists of the green lobby : the Sierra Club , the League of Conservation Voters , the Natural Resources Defense Council , the National Toxics Campaign and the Citizens for a Better Environment . 
Not only Californians but all Americans would pay if this thing passed . 
The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that do n't meet the initiative 's standards . 
As usual the green lobby 's proposal is disconnected from scientific reality . 
Consider the greenhouse-effect provision . 
The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40 % . 
The first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit . 
The key here is the ambition of state Attorney General John Van de Kamp . 
Mr. Van de Kamp is the one who collected the plans from the various radical environmental groups and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on Nov. 6 , 1990 . 
And it allows Mr. Van de Kamp to get around campaign spending limits . 
He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign 
He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign ; all the spending for the Van de Kamp initiative -LRB- on which there are no limits -RRB- is gravy . 
This initiative is being labeled The Big Green , but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback . 
While it is possible that the Big Green initiative will be ruled unconstitutional , it is of course conceivable that in modern California it could slide through . 
The initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he does n't like . 
That means the NRDC and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation 
Mr. Van de Kamp and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple-pie issue among certain segments of California 's population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific , anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric . 
Spurred by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of Friday 's 190.58-point plunge , gaining 88.12 to 2657.38 . 
While the advance cheered investors who feared a 1987-style crash would occur yesterday , it was strictly a big-stock rally fed by huge buying by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders . 
A troubling sign : Declining stocks on the Big Board outnumbered advancers , 975 to 749 , and the over-the-counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of Friday 's late Big Board plunge . 
Transports plunged on takeover disappointments in two airline stocks , UAL and AMR , which each fell more than 20 % when they reopened for trading yesterday after being suspended Friday afternoon . 
Overall , `` this is a pleasant rally but it 's very selective , '' said Arthur Cashin Jr. , a veteran PaineWebber Inc. trader at the Big Board . 
`` Everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory . 
It 's just a strange feeling . 
Then , to make matters worse , computerized sell programs kicked in , hammering stocks into steeper losses . 
There was heavy stock-index arbitrage , as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock-index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the two markets . 
The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized . 
They did n't . 
And this time , it was n't just the program traders who were responsible . 
Roland M. Machold , director of the New Jersey Division of Investment , which oversees $ 29 billion in investments , said the `` first thing we did was to double our orders '' yesterday morning . 
Trading in Walt Disney Co. particularly caught traders ' eyes . 
According to Big Board officials , Disney had one of the biggest sell-order imbalances on Friday 
Around Wall Street , trading desks were relieved that they could at least play the market yesterday , in contrast to Friday 's gridlock . 
At Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. , head equity trader Dudley Eppel said : `` I think the opening was constructive . 
It was orderly . 
We put some orders together . 
There was n't a lot of panic selling , either domestically or internationally ... . 
On the Big Board floor and on trading desks , traders yelped their approval . 
Grinned Griffith Peck , a trader in Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's OTC department : `` I tell you , this market acts healthy . '' 
Around him , scores of traders seemed to get a burst of energy 
But not everybody was making money . 
The carnage on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , the nation 's major options market , was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock-index options was halted Friday . 
Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday , and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses . 
James Gallagher , a partner at specialist Fowler & Rosenau , said , `` The difference between today and two years ago '' -- `` Terrible Tuesday , '' Oct. 20 , 1987 -- `` is that then we needed a savior to go into the Major Market Index , spend $ 2 million and get the program rally started . 
However , according to one analyst , the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of Terrible Tuesday . 
Among other major issues , Coca-Cola Co. closed up 2 at 66 3\/4 on 1.7 million shares and American Telephone & Telegraph rose 3 1\/4 to 43 on nearly 7.8 million shares . 
Shares of three brokerage firms rose after they reported earnings . 
Mr. Phelan said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for triggering Friday 's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer-driven strategies in recent months . 
Mr. Phelan expressed relief that the market rebounded yesterday . 
Meanwhile , Peter DaPuzzo , Shearson 's head of retail equity trading , praised institutional investors in the OTC market , who were heavy buyers of the Nasdaq 's biggest technology issues yesterday amid a flood of selling by other investors . 
`` The institutions ca n't be criticized for their behavior , '' Mr. DaPuzzo said in an interview . 
`` It was the opposite of what happened on Oct. 19 . 
They used their judgment . 
Mr. Phelan said the performance of specialists during Friday 's plunge was admirable , because out of 1,640 Big Board common stocks traded during the day only seven were closed and were n't reopened before the close . 
West Germany 's Green Party joined its ideological soulmates Jeremy Rifkin and the Christic Institute in the legal battle to ground the Atlantis shuttle and its plutonium-powered Galileo probe to Jupiter . 
The anti-defense Greens wanted a Washington federal appeals court to block today 's scheduled liftoff long enough for them to ask the World Court to `` order '' a permanent cancellation of the $ 1.5 billion flight . 
A three-judge appeals panel yesterday refused to comply , though liberal Judge Pat Wald went out of her way to deny that this was a `` frivolous '' case . 
Of course it was . 
But the six-hour compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions . 
Within the Senate , the ban has had aggressive support from Sen. Frank Lautenberg -LRB- D. , N.J. -RRB- , who has used his position as a Senate Appropriations subcommittee chairman to garner votes for the initiative . 
But the industry retains support in the House leadership through the influence of grower states , such as North Carolina . 
Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest , the underlying bill was the subject of behind-the-scenes lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more mundane , but politically important , projects of members . 
In a stark lesson in the power of the appropriations committees , the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in Florida , Illinois and Pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor . 
Within the Federal Aviation Administration , the final bill promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than 20 % from last year , and total operations would rise to $ 3.84 billion -- a 12 % boost . 
Though smaller in total dollars , the conference agreed to preserve an estimated $ 30.6 million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports .

Congress has been critical of the Bush administration for not sending enough aid to Poland , so it is getting ready to send its own version of a CARE package . 
Senator Pete Domenici calls this effort `` the first gift of democracy . '' 
The Poles might do better to view it as a Trojan Horse . 
`` It was a pretty wild day . 
Some fixed-income investors had expected a further drop in stock prices after the nearly 200-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Friday . 
The bond market seemed to ignore evidence that the Federal Reserve eased credit conditions slightly by allowing the federal funds rate to drift as low as 8 1\/2 % . 
In fact , some economists contend that the latest easing started last week . 
The reversal was even more evident among shorter-term Treasury securities . 
But prices of junk bonds , which were battered Friday in near standstill trading , rebounded to post small gains after a volatile trading session . 
Jay Goldinger , who often trades overnight for Capital Insight Inc. , Beverly Hills , Calif. , said trading in Tokyo was `` very active '' but highly volatile . 
Tokyo 's market turned out to be a bad bellwether for U.S. trading . 
Industrial production is expected to have declined 0.2 % , according to a consensus of economists surveyed by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report . 
A widening of that magnitude , said one New York trader , is `` not a favorable number ... . 
`` There 's lots of supply , '' the New York trader said . 
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was quoted late at a price of 101 19\/32 , compared with a closing price of 103 12\/32 Friday . 
Short-term interest rates fell yesterday at the government 's weekly Treasury bill auction .

Government National Mortgage Association 9 % securities for November delivery were quoted late yesterday at 98 4\/32 , down 30\/32 from Friday ; 9 1\/2 % securities were down 27\/32 at 100 5\/32 ; and 10 % securities were at 102 2\/32 , off 24\/32 . 
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 % securities were at 97 1\/4 , down 3\/4 . 
Trading was hectic during the morning , with players trying to gauge whether equities would continue Friday 's free fall or stabilize after a brief spot of weakness . 
Professionals dominated municipal trading throughout the session .

`` There is no pressing need to sell the unit , but we are doing it so we can concentrate on our core business , renting automobiles in the U.S. and abroad , '' said William Slider , Hertz 's executive vice president . 
Hertz Equipment had operating profit before depreciation of $ 90 million on revenue of $ 150 million in 1988 . 
Interspec Inc. reported a net loss of $ 2.4 million for the fiscal third quarter ended Aug. 31 .

DIG Acquisition Corp. , the New Jersey investor 's acquisition vehicle , said that as of the close of business yesterday , 560,839 shares had been tendered . 
If you guessed black-and-white snapshots , you 're right . 
Trendy magazine advertisements feature stark black-and-white photos of Hollywood celebrities pitching jeans , shoes and liquor . 
What 's happening in photography mirrors the popularity of black and white in fashion , home furnishings and cinematography . 
Photographic companies are scrambling to tap the resurging market , reviving some black-and-white product lines and developing new ones . 
Also trying to snare a portion of the $ 2 billion-a-year industry is Agfa Corp. , a unit of Bayer AG . 
Agfa recently signed Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith-Joyner to endorse a new line of black-and-white paper that 's geared to consumers and will compete directly with Kodak 's papers . 
The biggest beneficiary of the black-and-white revival is likely to be International Paper Co. 's Ilford division , known in the industry for its premium products . 
Sales of Ilford 's four varieties of black-and-white film this year are outpacing growth in the overall market , although the company wo n't say by exactly how much . 
For baby boomers who grew up being photographed in color , black and white seems eye-catching and exotic . 
`` It has an archival , almost nostalgic quality to it , '' says Owen B. Butler , the chairman of the applied photography department at Rochester Institute of Technology . 
Such features have been especially attractive to professional photographers and marketing executives , who have been steadily increasing their use of black and white in advertising . 
Consider Gap Inc. , whose latest ad campaign features black-and-white shots of Hollywood stars , artists and other well-known personalities modeling the retailer 's jeans and T-shirts . 
Even food products and automobiles , which have long depended on color , are making the switch . 
Portrait studios have also latched onto the trend . 
One customer , Dayna Brunsdon , says she spurned a color portrait for black and white because `` it 's more dramatic . 
I show it to my friends , and they all say ` wow . ' 
Still , most consumers are n't plunking black-and-white film into their cameras to take family snapshots . 
One big obstacle is that few drugstores develop the film anymore . 
Other companies are introducing related products . 
The kit , which has a suggested retail price of $ 250 and has already become a bestseller , was introduced after retailers noticed numerous requests from parents for children 's photography equipment . 
But some industry observers believe the resurgence of black and white is only a fad . 
`` Black and white has n't made the same quantum leaps in technological development as color , '' says Mr. Butler of the Rochester Institute . 
`` The color print today is far superior to prints of 10 years ago . 
But when Popular Photography , a leading magazine for photographers , selected 15 of the greatest photos ever made for its latest issue celebrating photography 's 150th anniversary , all were black and white . 
For the nine months , the newspaper chain had almost a 23 % increase in profit to $ 23.6 million , or 83 cents a share , from $ 19.2 million , or 68 cents a share .

In contrast , the Commerce Department 's widely followed index of leading indicators , while up in August , has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year . 
Based largely on the recent strength in their index , called the long leading indicator , the Columbia analysts foresee uninterrupted economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well . 
Underlying this optimism is the index 's longstanding ability to signal recessions or recoveries , as the case may be , by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department 's index of leading indicators . 
The Columbia economists also have reconstructed how the long leading index would have behaved , had it existed , in 1929 , before the stock market crash in October that ushered in the Great Depression . 
The indicator reached a peak in January 1929 and then fell steadily up to and through the crash . 
As recently as 1975 , the stock market -- as reflected in the Standard & Poor 's index of 500 common stocks -- was rated by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the best of the 12 leading indicators that then made up the Commerce index . 
BSN will initially acquire a 15 % interest in Birkel , a closely held concern . 
Moody 's Investors Service Inc. said it reduced its rating on $ 281 million of senior and subordinated debt of this thrift holding company , to C from Ca , saying it believes bondholders will recover only `` negligible principal . '' 
The rating agency also reduced the ratings for long-term deposits to B-3 from Ba-3 and for preferred stock to Ca from Caa . 
THE STOCK MARKET AVOIDED a repeat of Black Monday as prices recovered from an early slide , spurred by bargain-hunting institutions and program traders . 
The Dow Jones industrials closed up 88.12 points , at 2657.38 , the fourth-biggest gain ever , after being down as much as 63.52 points in the morning . 
The dollar also rebounded , while bond prices plummeted and Treasury bill rates soared . 
Junk bonds also recovered somewhat , though trading remained stalled . 
Donald Trump withdrew his $ 7.54 billion offer for American Air , citing the `` recent change in market conditions . ''

Under the agreement , Intel will invest $ 3 million to acquire a 4 % stake in Alliant , a maker of minisupercomputers for scientists and engineers . 
Alliant said it plans to use the microprocessor in future products .

A unit of troubled Southmark Corp. , the operator of nursing homes and retirement centers said it sustained a net loss of $ 1.6 million , or nine cents a share , compared with net income of $ 1.3 million , or eight cents a share , a year earlier . 
The U.S. journalist 's `` crime '' was writing that the head of the commission charged with overseeing the election 's fairness , Bryan O'Linn , was openly sympathetic to SWAPO . 
To the extent Mr. Stanley has done anything wrong , it may be that he is out of step with the consensus of world intellectuals that the Namibian guerrillas were above all else the victims of suppression by neighboring South Africa . 
In July , Mr. Stanley , editor of American Press International , a Washington D.C.-based conservative wire service , visited Namibia to report on the U.N.-monitored election campaign . 
He interviewed Mr. O'Linn , head of a commission charged with investigating electoral intimidation , and reported that Mr. O'Linn was openly sympathetic to SWAPO and indeed had defended its leaders in court . 
After Mr. Stanley 's article was published in two Namibian newspapers , Mr. O'Linn had criminal charges brought against their editors , publisher and lawyer . 
Mr. Stanley 's arrest is the latest in a series of incidents that threaten to derail Namibia 's elections . 
Both South African and SWAPO extremists are intimidating voters . 
The U.S. is in the habit of arranging peace settlements and then washing its hands over the tragic results . 
It now has the chance to redress that record in Namibia . 
Copper and crude oil reacted sharply to the concern that a crash yesterday could have a potentially devastating effect on the economy . 
Copper fell and showed little rebound through the day as one of the major supply problems that had been supporting prices appeared to be solved . 
In commodity markets yesterday : PRECIOUS METALS : Futures prices were moderately higher as gold gave up some of its early gains and platinum behaved independently , first falling and then later rising . 
The spot October gold price rose $ 4 to $ 367.30 an ounce . 
The more active December delivery gold settled with a gain of $ 3.90 an ounce at $ 371.20 , after trading as high as $ 374 . 
December silver was up 2.3 cents an ounce at $ 5.163 . 
For one thing , last Friday , precious metals markets closed before the stock market went into its late-in-the-day nose dive , so it could n't react to it . 
Back on Friday , Oct. 16 , l987 , the stock market declined during the day , and gold prices surged as the stock market fell . 
The October 1987 contract that day rose as much as $ 8.70 to as high as $ 471.60 , and the more deferred positions , due to mature as late as March 1989 , rose as much as $ 9.60 . 
On Black Monday , Oct. 19 , 1987 , the October contract tacked on further gains , rising to as high as $ 491.50 for a gain of almost $ 20 on top of the Friday advances , before giving up almost $ 10 of that at the close . 
Yesterday 's October gain of $ 4 was miniscule compared with that . 
One analyst , Peter Cardillo of Josephthal & Co. , New York , said the gold market already had some good price-supporting technical factors that would have caused prices to rise , with or without the stock market . 
`` What the stock market did was cause the rise to take place earlier than it would have happened , '' said Mr. Cardillo . 
There 's a good chance that gold will retain its gains and rise further , he said . 
Finally , according to Mr. Cardillo , the impact of the strong dollar should be reflected in reduced exports in the August merchandise trade deficit , when the figures are released today . 
Worried that Friday 's 190-point stock market plunge might be a harbinger of things to come for the economy , petroleum futures traders called a halt to the recent string of increases in crude oil futures prices . 
But most market observers agreed that Friday 's stock market drop is what dampened spirits in the petroleum pits yesterday . 
Until yesterday , futures prices had been headed up on expectations that world oil demand will continue to be strong . 
Futures prices fell and showed little rebound as one major labor problem that had been underpinning prices appeared to be solved . 
The December contract declined 3.05 cents a pound to $ 1.2745 . 
Last week it was reported that company and union negotiations had overcome the major hurdle , the contracting out of work by the company . 
Now , the analyst said , only minor points remain to be cleaned up . 
Copper inventories in New York 's Commodity Exchange warehouses rose yesterday by 516 tons , to 10,004 tons . 
Copper inventories in New York 's Commodity Exchange warehouses rose yesterday by 516 tons , to 10,004 tons . London Metal Exchange copper inventories last week declined 13,575 tons , to 89,300 tons . 
However , this was brushed aside by concern over the stock market , the analyst said . 
At one point in futures trading , as the stock market firmed , the December contract rose to as high as $ 1.2965 , but it was n't able to sustain the gain . 
Futures prices eased , more in reaction to Hurricane Jerry than to any influence of the stock market . 
However , after absorbing the potential effect of the hurricane , prices began to slip late Friday , Mr. Simon said . 
Colder weather is being predicted for the high plains of Texas and the northern states of the Delta during the coming weekend , Mr. Simon said . 
Futures prices declined . 
The March contract was off 0.32 cent a pound at 13.97 cents . 
At one point in early trading the March price rose to as high as 14.22 cents when the stock market recovered , but the price then fell back . 
A price-depressing factor , one analyst said , was that India , which had been expected to buy around 200,000 tons of sugar in the world market , did n't make any purchases . 
Another analyst thought that India may have pulled back because of the concern over the stock market . 
`` India may have felt that if there was a severe drop in the stock market and it affected sugar , it could buy at lower prices , '' said Judith Ganes , analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton , New York . 
The prices of most grain futures contracts rose slightly yesterday out of relief that the stock market was showing signs of recovering . 
Earlier in the session , the prices of several soybean contracts set new lows . 
The Knight-Ridder spokesman said the third-quarter earnings that the company plans to report Oct. 24 are expected to be up . 
Golden West Financial Corp. , riding above the turbulence that has troubled most of the thrift industry , posted a 16 % increase of third-quarter earnings to $ 41.8 millon , or 66 cents a share . 
In savings activity , Mr. Sandler said consumer deposits have enjoyed a steady increase throughout 1989 , and topped $ 11 billion at quarter 's end for the first time in the company 's history . 
The maker of home appliances said the process , which involves the use of a multilayer plastic bag during repairs to capture the gaseous substance and transport it to a recycling center , is already in use at a number of its service centers , and will be available to all authorized repair centers by spring . 
But their use has been linked to a potentially dangerous depletion of the Earth 's ozone layer , and a number of companies are seeking to curtail use , or at least emission , of the substance . 
However , Maxus said it believes the reserves in the field are about 10 million barrels of oil . 
The Little Rock , Ark. , hazardous-waste services company said the restatement will reduce its net for the nine months ended July 31 to $ 2.5 million , or 17 cents a share , from $ 3.7 million , or 26 cents a share . 
But because of confusion , it took those credits again in reporting its results through the first nine months . 
In American Stock Exchange composite trading , ISI closed up $ 3.125 at $ 18.625 . 
But it said Charles Johnston , ISI chairman and president , agreed to sell his 60 % stake in ISI to Memotec upon completion of the tender offer for a combination of cash , Memotec stock and debentures . 
ISI said its board has instructed management to accept inquiries from any others interested in making a bid . 
At the time of the original announcement , CMS said its board authorized the purchase of as many as five million of its shares . 
A spokesman said 2.6 million shares have been purchased since then . 
CWA 's New Jersey Commercial local , which represents about 2,500 service representatives and marketing employees , rejected the tentative agreement . 
The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped sharply yesterday to close at 2657.38 , panic did n't sweep the world 's markets , and investors large and small seemed to accept Friday 's dizzying 190-point plunge as a sharp correction , not a calamity . 
At first , it seemed as if history might repeat itself . 
As trading opened yesterday morning on the Big Board , stocks of many of the nation 's biggest companies could n't open for trading because a wave of sell orders was overwhelming buyers . 
But then , as quickly as the Dow had fallen , it began to turn around . 
By the market 's close , volume on the New York exchange totaled more than 416 million , the fourth highest on record . 
The Frankfurt stock exchange was hardest hit of the major markets , with blue chips there falling 12.8 % . 
In London , a midday rally left the market 's major index off 3.2 % , and Tokyo 's leading stock index fell only 1.8 % in surprisingly lackluster trading . 
Investors big and small say they learned valuable lessons since the 1987 crash 
Investors big and small say they learned valuable lessons since the 1987 crash : In this age of computerized trading , huge corrections or runups in a few hours ' time must be expected . 
Stephen Boesel , a major money manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore , says , `` There was less panic than in 1987 
In Somerset , Wis. , Adrian Sween , who owns a supplier of nursing-home equipment and is n't active in the stock market , agrees . 
Many other factors played a part in yesterday 's comeback . 
The Federal Reserve signaled its willingness to provide liquidity 
The Federal Reserve signaled its willingness to provide liquidity ; the interest rate on its loans to major banks inched downward early in the day . 
Foreign stock markets , which kicked off Black Monday with a huge selling spree , began the day off by relatively modest amounts . 
Still , amid all the backslapping and signs of relief over yesterday 's events , some market professionals cautioned that there is nothing present in the current market system to prevent another dizzying drop such as Friday 's . 
So investors everywhere nervously eyed yesterday 's opening in Tokyo , where the Nikkei average of 225 blue-chip stocks got off to a rocky start . 
Unlike two years ago , most of Japan 's major investors chose to sit this calamity out . 
In Merrill Lynch & Co. 's Tokyo trading room , some 40 traders and assistants sat quietly , with few orders to process . 
The relative calm in Tokyo proved little comfort to markets opening up in Europe . 
Frankfurt 's opening was delayed a half hour because of a crush of sell orders . 
In London , the view from the trading floor of an American securities firm , Jefferies & Co. , also was troubling . 
The screen was a sea of red . 
When trading opened in New York at 9:30 a.m. EDT , stocks fell sharply -- as expected . 
Futures markets in Chicago had opened at a level suggesting the Dow would fall by about 60 points . 
With sell orders piled up from Friday , about half the stocks in the Dow could n't open on time . 
By 9:45 , the industrial average had dropped 27 points . 
By 10 a.m. , it was down 49 . 
But shortly before then , some of Wall Street 's sharpest traders say , they sensed a turn . 
`` The first thing that caught my eye that was encouraging was Treasury bonds were off , '' says Austin George , head of stock trading at T. Rowe Price . 
Shortly after 10 a.m. , the Major Market Index , a Chicago Board of Trade futures contract of 20 stocks designed to mimic the DJIA , exploded upward . 
`` The MMI has gone better , '' shouted a trader in the London office of Shearson Lehman Hutton . 
Shearson 's London trading room went wild . 
Then , nine minutes later , Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day . 
Japanese were said to be heavy buyers . 
By 10:25 , the Dow had turned up for the day , prompting cheers on trading desks and exchange floors . 
`` It was bedlam on the upside , '' said one Big Board specialist . 
Typical , perhaps , was Batterymarch 's Dean LeBaron . 
Mr. LeBaron , who manages $ 10 billion , says , `` We turned the trading system on , and it did whatever it was programmed to do . '' 
Not everybody was making money . 
The carnage on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , the nation 's major options market , was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock-index options was halted Friday . 
Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday , and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses . 
Meanwhile , a test of the stock market 's rally came at about 2 p.m. , with the Dow at 2600 , up 31 points on the day . 
Instead , the rally only paused for about 25 minutes and then steamed forward as institutions resumed buying . 
Across the country , many people took yesterday 's events in stride , while remaining generally uneasy about the stock market in general . 
Says James Norman , the mayor of Ava , Mo. : `` I do n't invest in stocks . 
While Mayor Norman found the market 's performance Monday reassuring , he says , he remains uneasy . 
Says Gordon Fines , a money manager at IDS Financial Services in Minneapolis , `` You 're on a roller coaster , and that may last . 
Skipper 's previously turned down a $ 10-a-share proposal from National Pizza and Pizza Hut Inc. questioned whether the purchase would violate National Pizza 's franchise agreements . 
For the 12 weeks ended Sept. 3 , Skipper 's had net income of $ 361,000 , or 13 cents a share , compared with a net loss a year earlier . 
Gorbachev blamed the Soviet Union 's press for contributing to the nation 's mounting problems .

Mr. Farley said the sale of three of Cluett 's four main divisions plus other `` anticipated '' West Point-Pepperell asset sales by December , should bring in a total of about $ 700 million . 
The moves also could erase shareholders ' perception of Blue Arrow as a company in turmoil . 
`` It further reinforces the concept that Blue Arrow is a thing of the past , '' said Doug Arthur , an analyst at Kidder Peabody & Co. in New York . 
In a widely publicized boardroom coup , Mr. Fromstein ousted Antony Berry as Blue Arrow chief executive in January , a month after Mr. Berry had forced Mr. Fromstein out as the $ 1 million-a-year chief of Milwaukee-based Manpower . 
Blue Arrow was able to pull off the $ 1.34 billion takeover of Manpower in 1987 largely because different British and American accounting standards produce higher reported earnings for British companies . 
Under British rules , Blue Arrow was able to write off at once the $ 1.15 billion in good will arising from the purchase . 
But with so many shares now held in the U.S. , Blue Arrow reports its earnings two ways , based on both U.K. and U.S. accounting standards . 
`` Our balance sheets look like they came from Alice 's wonderland , '' Mr. Fromstein said . 
Mr. Fromstein said he hopes to eradicate some of the good will left on Blue Arrow 's U.S. books in one fell swoop , but would n't specify how much . 
The Watertown , Mass. , company 's sales have been dormant and its profits have dropped . 
Besides spurring Barry Wright 's sales , which were $ 201.7 million in 1988 , Mr. Sim must pare its costs and product line . 
The answer will help determine whether Applied continues to reach the ambitious goals set by Mr. Sim . 
The Butler , Wis. , manufacturer went public at $ 15.75 a share in August 1987 , and Mr. Sim 's goal then was a $ 29 per-share price by 1992 . 
Strong earnings growth helped achieve that price far ahead of schedule , in August 1988 . 
In Barry Wright , Mr. Sim sees a situation `` very similar '' to the one he faced when he joined Applied as president and chief operating officer in 1985 . 
Applied , then a closely held company , was stagnating under the management of its controlling family . 
Mr. Sim considers the new unit 's operations `` fundamentally sound '' and adds that Barry Wright has been fairly successful in moving into markets that have n't interested larger competitors . 
Mr. Sim figures it will be easier to turn Barry Wright around since he 's now in the driver 's seat . 
At Applied , Mr. Sim set growth as his first objective . 
He took the company public in an offering that netted Applied about $ 12.6 million , which helped launch the company 's acquisition program . 
Sales climbed to an estimated $ 245 million in fiscal 1989 , ended Aug. 31 , from $ 99.9 million in fiscal 1985 .
