This confusion effectively halted one form of program trading , stock index arbitrage , that closely links the futures and stock markets , and has been blamed by some for the market 's big swings . 
The Dow industrials were down 55 points at 3 p.m. before the futures-trading halt . At 3:30 p.m. , at the end of the `` cooling off '' period , the average was down 114.76 points .

Ripples from the strike by 55,000 Machinists union members against Boeing Co. reached air carriers Friday 
Peter Otradovec , vice president for planning at the Phoenix , Ariz. , carrier , said in an interview that the work stoppage at Boeing , now entering its 13th day , `` has caused some turmoil in our scheduling 
Mr. Otradovec said Boeing told America West that the 757 it was supposed to get this Thursday would n't be delivered until Nov. 7 -- the day after the airline had been planning to initiate service at Houston with four daily flights , including three nonstops to Phoenix and one nonstop to Las Vegas . 
At this point , no other America West flights -- including its new service at San Antonio , Texas ; Newark , N.J. ; and Palmdale , Calif. -- have been affected by the delays in Boeing deliveries . 
Nevertheless , the company 's reaction underscores the domino effect that a huge manufacturer such as Boeing can have on other parts of the economy .

When the price of plastics took off in 1987 , Quantum Chemical Corp. went along for the ride 
The timing of Quantum 's chief executive officer , John Hoyt Stookey , appeared to be nothing less than inspired 
The company outpaced much of the chemical industry 
When the price of plastics took off in 1987 , Quantum Chemical Corp. went along for the ride . 
But now prices have nose-dived 
Pricing cycles , to be sure , are nothing new for plastics producers . 
Once known as National Distillers & Chemical Corp. , the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics 
Mr. Stookey , 59 years old , declined to be interviewed for this article 
Quantum 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene resin , used to make garbage bags , milk jugs , housewares , toys and meat packaging , among other items . 
But its competitors -- including Dow Chemical Co. , Union Carbide Corp. and several oil giants -- have much broader business interests 
When the price of polyethylene moves a mere penny a pound , Quantum 's annual profit fluctuates by about 85 cents a share , provided no other variables are changing 
In recent months the price of polyethylene , even more than that of other commodity plastics , has taken a dive . 
That discrepancy hurts Quantum badly 
China , which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene , abruptly halted them . 
Calculating that excess polyethylene would soon be sloshing around the world , other buyers then bet that prices had peaked 
Kenneth Mitchell , director of Dow 's polyethylene business , says producers were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain 
They recently announced increases of a few cents a pound to take effect in the next several weeks . 
No one knows , however , whether the new posted prices will stick

The U.S. , which is finalizing its steel-import quotas , is allocating a larger share of its steel market to developing and newly industrialized countries which have relatively unsubsidized steel industries . 
Of the remaining 20 % needed , the steel-quota negotiations allocate about 15 % to foreign suppliers , with the difference supplied mainly by Canada -- which is n't included in the quota program . 
The Bush administration earlier this year said it would extend steel quotas , known as voluntary restraint agreements , until March 31 , 1992 . 
That increase rises to slightly more than 2 % of the U.S. market 
Mexico , which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the U.S. , virtually doubled its quota to 0.95 % of the U.S. steel market from 0.48 % under the previous quotas . South Korea , which had 1.9 % under the previous quotas , is set to get a small increase to about 1.95 % . That increase rises to slightly more than 2 % of the U.S. market if a joint Korean-U.S. steel project is included . 
In the recent talks , the EC had its quota increased about 300,000 tons , to 7 % of the U.S. market from 6.7 % in 1988 .

She said the company will study results from this market 
The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan 
When Attack hit the shelves in 1987 , P&G 's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 %

Earnings for most of the nation 's major pharmaceutical makers are believed to have moved ahead briskly in the third quarter 
Earnings for most of the nation 's major pharmaceutical makers are believed to have moved ahead briskly in the third quarter , as companies with newer , big-selling prescription drugs fared especially well . 
Joseph Riccardo , an analyst with Bear , Stearns & Co. , said that over the past few years most drug makers have shed their slow-growing businesses and instituted other cost savings , such as consolidating manufacturing plants and administrative staffs . 
While that 's not spectacular , Neil Sweig , an analyst with Prudential Bache , said that the rate of growth will `` look especially good as compared to other companies if the economy turns downward

Profit climbed 
Mr. Sweig said he estimated that Lilly 's earnings for the quarter jumped about 20 % , largely because of the performance of its new anti-depressant Prozac . 
Mr. Riccardo of Bear Stearns said that Schering-Plough Corp. 's expected profit rise of about 18 % to 20 % , and Bristol-Meyers 's expected profit increase of about 13 % are 
ScheringPlough earned $ 94.4 million , or 84 cents a share 
Mr. Sweig estimated that Merck 's profit for the quarter rose by about 22 % , propelled by sales of its line-up of fast-growing prescription drugs , including its anti-cholesterol drug , Mevacor ; a high blood pressure medicine , Vasotec ; Primaxin , an antibiotic , and Pepcid , an anti-ulcer medication . Mr. Sweig said he estimated that Lilly 's earnings for the quarter jumped about 20 % , largely because of the performance of its new anti-depressant Prozac . Several analysts said they expected Warner-Lambert 's profit also to increase by more than 20 % from $ 87.7 million , or $ 1.25 a share , it reported in the like period last year . Squibb 's profit , estimated by analysts to be about 18 % above the $ 123 million , or $ 1.25 a share , it earned in the third quarter of 1988 , was the result of especially strong sales of its Capoten drug for treating high blood pressure and other heart disease . Mr. Riccardo of Bear Stearns said that Schering-Plough Corp. 's expected profit rise of about 18 % to 20 % , and Bristol-Meyers 's expected profit increase of about 13 % are largely because `` those companies are really managed well . '' 
Meanwhile , analysts said Pfizer 's recent string of lackluster quarterly performances continued 
Sales of both drugs have been hurt by new state laws restricting the prescriptions of certain tranquilizing medicines and adverse publicity about the excessive use of the drugs .

A handful of hot retail locations , such as the 57th Street and Madison and Fifth Avenue areas , have been able to sustain what many see as astronomical rents . And , in some neighborhoods , rents have merely hit a plateau . 
That follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months 
`` As businesses contract or depart , the number of employees who might use retail services shrinks 
In these locations , Mr. Friedman says , `` Retailers are increasingly cautious about expanding

Madison and Fifth Avenues and East 57th Street can command rents of up to $ 500 a square foot 
Madison and Fifth Avenues and East 57th Street can command rents of up to $ 500 a square foot , and $ 250 is not uncommon . The thriving 34th Street area offers rents of about $ 100 a square foot , as do up-and-coming locations along lower Fifth Avenue . 
By contrast , rentals in the best retail locations in Boston , San Francisco and Chicago rarely top $ 100 a square foot . 
When Justice William Brennan marks the start of his 34th year on the Supreme Court today , the occasion will differ sharply from previous anniversaries of his tenure 
For the first time , the 83-year-old justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent , rather than as a force in the high court 's majority . This role reversal holds true , as well , for his three liberal and moderate allies , Justices Thurgood Marshall , Harry Blackmun and John Stevens . 
The four justices are no newcomers to dissent , often joining forces in the past decade to criticize the court 's conservative drift . 
But always , in years past , they have bucked the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to eke out a number of major victories in civil rights and liberties cases . 
Now , however , as the court 's new five-member conservative majority continues to solidify , victories for the liberals are rare 
The change is most dramatic for Justice Brennan , the last survivor of the mid-1960s liberal majority under Chief Justice Earl Warren . 
`` Each time the court revisits an issue , the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions 
But Justice Brennan foresaw his new role , strongly defending the importance of dissents in a 1985 speech . 
Moreover , in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s , he knew that the tables might turn in the future 
`` We could sweep it under the rug and hide it 
Associates of 81-year-old Justice Marshall say he was `` depressed '' about the court 's direction last spring , but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights . 
Friends and associates who saw Justice Blackmun during the summer said he was no more discouraged about the court than in recent years . 
And his outlook improved after successful cataract surgery in August . 
Justice Stevens , 69 , is probably the most philosophical of the dissenters about his role

The government sold the deposits of four savings-and-loan institutions , in its first wave of sales of big , sick thrifts 
The four S&Ls were sold to large banks , as was the case with most of the 28 previous transactions initiated by the Resolution Trust 
Under these deals , the RTC sells just the deposits and the healthy assets . 
These `` clean-bank '' transactions leave the bulk of bad assets , mostly real estate , with the government , to be sold later . 
Acquirers paid premiums ranging from 1.5 % to 3.7 % for the deposits and branch systems , roughly in line with what analysts were expecting . 
After that , the buyers may repudiate the rates paid by the former thrifts . 
But it 's uncertain whether these institutions will take those steps . 
NCNB , for example , has been one of the highest rate payers in the Texas market 
The RTC had previously targeted five thrifts for quick sales

As a measure of the depths to which the Texas real estate market has sunk , the RTC will pay $ 3.8 billion to NCNB to take $ 750 million of bad assets . 
NCNB will pay the RTC a premium of $ 40.4 million for $ 1.1 billion in deposits . 
Meridian will pay a premium of $ 30.5 million to assume $ 2 billion in deposits . 
Royal Trustco will pay the RTC $ 25 million to assume $ 989 million in deposits . 
In a related development , the news-weekly , for the fourth year in a row , said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in 1990 ; a full , four-color page in the magazine costs about $ 120,000 . 
However , because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered , ad rates will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber , according to Richard Heinemann , Time associate publisher 
Deep discounts in subscriptions and offers of free clock radios and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the hyper-competitive world of magazine news-weeklies . 
But Time , as part of the more cost-conscious Time Warner , wants to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks . 
Time magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers . 
However , Time executives used the same explanation

Although viewership soars 
CNN executives worry that the network 's punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and wo n't keep viewers coming back 
`` Just the fact we 're on 24 hours is no longer bulletin , '' says Ed Turner , CNN 's executive vice president , news gathering -LRB- and no relation to Ted Turner -RRB- . `` You ca n't live on that . '' 
The new show is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more full-length `` signature '' programming with recognizable stars . 
It is paying higher salaries -- after years of scrimping -- to lure and keep experienced staffers . 
`` The next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables , '' says Jon Petrovich , executive vice president of Headline News , CNN 's sister network . 
Networks , like other consumer products , develop images in peoples ' minds that are n't easy to change . 
It also takes money that CNN has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see . 
The repositioning bid is aimed at CNN 's unsteady viewership -- and what may happen to it 
Already , CNN is facing stronger competition from Financial News Network Inc. and General Electric Co. 's Consumer News and Business Channel , both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future .

Interprovincial transports about 75 % of all crude produced in western Canada 
`` It 's very much a growing concern . 
But when something is inevitable , you learn to live with it 
Mr. Lichtblau said Canada 's declining crude output , combined with the fast-shrinking output of U.S. crude , will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas , particularly the Middle East . 
Mr. Lichtblau stressed that the delay of Interprovincial 's proposed expansion wo n't by itself increase U.S. dependence on offshore crude , however 
In July , the company stunned Wall Street with the prediction that growth in the personal computer business overall would be only 10 % in 1990 , a modest increase 
Investors -- taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the offing -- reacted by selling the company 's stock , which lost $ 3.25 that day to close at $ 52 in national over-the-counter trading . 
Among those companies expected to have a down quarter are Hewlett-Packard Co. , Amdahl Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. , generally solid performers in the past .

In July , the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from Apple and IBM had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended June 30 to $ 7.4 million , or 23 cents a share . 
While the earnings picture confuses , observers say the major forces expected to shape the industry in the coming year are clearer 
Until recently , Adobe had a lock on the market for image software 
Now the two firms are collaborating on an alternative to Adobe 's approach 
In computer publishing , a battle over typefaces is hurting Adobe Systems Inc. , which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays .

IBM is backing one type of bus called microchannel 
`` Users do n't care about the bus , '' said Daniel Benton , an analyst at Goldman , Sachs & Co . 
He said Apple 's family of Macintosh computers , for instance , uses four different buses 
Some lagging competitors even may leave the personal computer business altogether . 
`` Wyse has done well establishing a distribution business 
As a result of this trend , longtime powerhouses H-P , IBM and Digital Equipment Corp. are scrambling to counterattack with microprocessor-based systems of their own . 
Mr. Benton expects Compaq to unveil a family of high-end personal computers later this year that are powerful enough to serve as the hub for communications within large networks of desk-top machines . 
The gains , to be sure , are rather small . 
Iowa , for instance , saw its population grow by 11,000 people , or 0.4 % , between 1987 and 1988 , the Census Bureau says . 
Seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980 , including New York , which lost 4 % of its population during the 1970s . 
And although Pennsylvania and Massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade , they are growing again 
At the same time , several states in the South and West have had their own population turnaround . 
Overall , though , the South and West still outpace the Northeast and Midwest

The only thing Robert Goldberg could praise about CBS 's new show `` Island Son '' -LRB- Leisure & Arts , Sept. 25 -RRB- was the local color ; unfortunately neither he nor the producers of the show have done their homework . 
For instance : `` Haole '' -LRB- white -RRB- is not the ultimate insult ; `` Mainland haole '' is . 
And the local expression for brother is `` brah , '' not `` bruddah . ''

A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New York City . 
Not only is Mr. Mason the star of `` Chicken Soup 
Not only is Mr. Mason the star of `` Chicken Soup , '' he 's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to `` Duck Soup 
Here , in neutral language , is the gist of Mr. Mason 's remarks , quoted first in the Village Voice 
Here , in neutral language , is the gist of Mr. Mason 's remarks , quoted first in the Village Voice while he was a paid spokesman for the Rudolph Giuliani mayoral campaign , and then in Newsweek 
Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks 
He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination 
He said Jews were `` sick with complexes 
If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers , would the water be quite so hot 
It probably would 
It probably would , because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language . 
In addition , some of Mr. Mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism . 
The latter typically is the humor of the underdog 
In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce , this double-edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons . 
Why constructive ? 
As Elizabeth Kristol wrote in the New York Times just before the Mason donnybrook , `` Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity 
The question is , if group conflicts still exist 
The question is , if group conflicts still exist 
The question is , if group conflicts still exist -LRB- as undeniably they do -RRB- , and if Mr. Mason 's type of ethnic humor is passe 
Do n't say the TV sitcom 
It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in `` Cheers '' ; children vs. adults in `` The Cosby Show . '' 
Back in the 1920s , the play and movie versions of `` Abie 's Irish Rose '' made the theme of courtship between the assimilated offspring of Jewish and Irish immigrants so popular that its author , Anne Nichols , lost a plagiarism suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public domain . 
Clearly , the question with `` Chicken Soup '' is not whether the pot will boil over 
To some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them . 
For instance , Michael dislikes Jackie 
For instance , Michael dislikes Jackie not because he 's a shrewd Jewish businessman 
For instance , Michael dislikes Jackie 
The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end -LRB- and occasionally in the middle -RRB- , when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself . 
But too often , these routines lack spark 
That issue , like racial tensions in New York City , will have to cool down , not heat up 
I 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic-Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz . 
`` The economy , '' he added , `` remains well-balanced 
Lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax breaks and spending increases . 
But Senate supporters of the trimmer legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through Congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside , including a capital-gains tax cut . 
`` No one can predict exactly what will happen on the House side , '' said Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole -LRB- R. , Kan . -RRB- . 
House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- said in an interview , `` If that 's the signal that comes from the White House , that will help a great deal 
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- said he was `` confident '' that any House-Senate agreement on the deficit-reduction legislation would n't include a capital-gains tax cut . 
Because the legislation has n't been completed , President Bush has until midnight tonight to enact across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law 
`` Although I am encouraged by the Senate action , '' said Chairman Dan Rostenkowski -LRB- D. , Ill . -RRB- of the House Ways and Means Committee , `` it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the upcoming conference with the Senate 
He has been resisting a stripped-down bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut . 
But Republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural hurdle and garner the 60 votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor 
The Senate bill was stripped of many popular , though revenue-losing , provisions , a number of which are included in the House-passed bill . 
One high-profile provision that was originally in the Senate bill but was cut out 
To the delight of some doctors , the bill dropped a plan passed by the Finance Committee that would have overhauled the entire physician-reimbursement system under Medicare . 
It worked 
To the detriment of many low-income people , efforts to boost Medicaid funding , especially in rural areas , also were stricken .

The Senate bill was stripped of many popular , though revenue-losing , provisions , a number of which are included in the House-passed bill . These include a child-care initiative and extensions of soon-to-expire tax breaks for low-income housing and research-and-development expenditures . Also missing from the Senate bill is the House 's repeal of a law , called Section 89 , that compels companies to give rank-and-file workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives . One high-profile provision that was originally in the Senate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by Chairman Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- of the Senate Finance Committee to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts . Mr. Bentsen said he hopes the Senate will consider that measure soon . 
It no longer includes a plan that would have repealed what remains of the completed-contract method of accounting , which is used by military contractors to reduce their tax burden . 
It also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current retirees . 
Mr. Mitchell 's relations with Budget Director Darman , who pushed for a capital-gains cut to be added to the measure , have been strained 
The measure repeals a 50 % exclusion given to banks on the interest from loans used to acquire securities for an ESOP 
The deficit reduction bill contains $ 5.3 billion in tax increases in fiscal 1990 , and $ 26 billion over five years .

Such as , what happened 
4 . That the Journal defends `` the sleaze , fraud , waste , embezzlement , influence-peddling and abuse of the public that took place 
The problem , which the Journal so rightly pointed out in a number of articles , is not the likes of Mr. Lantos , who after all is really a bit player on the stage , but the attempt by Congress to enhance itself into a quasi-parliamentary\/judicial body .

This privilege against self-incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify . 
Thus , in a criminal case , a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify 
Thus , in a criminal case , a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness 
The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person `` shall be compelled , in any criminal case , to be a witness against himself . '' 
The privilege , however , has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only . 
Baxter v. Palmingiano , 425 U.S. 308 -LRB- 1976 -RRB- . The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that `` the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause . '' 
Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth 
He may take the Fifth in a civil matter 
Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter 
Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter 
He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution . 
Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution 
Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding 
The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference 
It was Friday the 13th 
Just a coincidence ? 
Robert Kolb and Ricardo Rodriguez , professors of finance at the University of Miami , found evidence that the market is spooked by Friday the 13th .

Whether unanswered phone calls had any effect or not , Nasdaq stocks sank far less than those on the New York and American exchanges .

The 1987 crash brought the Reagan administration and Democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit , resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ 76 billion 
The 1987 crash brought the Reagan administration and Democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit , resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ 76 billion -- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ 12 billion during that period .

The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met , estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ 11.0 billion . 
Rep. Panetta said that OMB 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts 
No one in Washington was willing to take the blame for provoking Friday 's drop in the stock market . 
Before the sun had set on Friday , Richard Rahn , the supply-side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains

`` These high rollers took a big bath today , '' he said in his showroom , which is within a few miles of the multi-million dollar homes of some of Houston 's richest citizens . 
But it 's not only the stock market that has some small investors worried . 
Not everyone is reacting so calmly , however , and many wonder about the long-term implications of what is widely viewed as the cause of Friday 's slide , reluctance by banks to provide financing for a buy-out of UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines . Others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand .
