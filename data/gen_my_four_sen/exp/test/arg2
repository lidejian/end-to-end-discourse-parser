as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 190.58 points -- most of it in the final hour -- it barely managed to stay this side of chaos . 
. 
-- because the stock market was so quiet . 
Then in a lightning plunge , the Dow Jones industrials in barely an hour surrendered about a third of their gains this year , chalking up a 190.58-point , or 6.9 % , loss on the day in gargantuan trading volume . 
In percentage terms , however , the Dow 's dive was the 12th-worst ever and the sharpest since the market fell 156.83 , or 8 % , a week after Black Monday . 
and UAL stock would rise . 
, '' said one top floor trader . 
when the news flashed . 
, after Campeau Corp. 's cash crunch spurred concern about the prospects for future highly leveraged takeovers . 
And 10 minutes after the UAL trading halt came news that the UAL group could n't get financing for its bid . 
-- but they rid themselves of nearly every `` rumor '' stock they had . 
For example , their selling caused trading halts to be declared in USAir Group , which closed down 3 7\/8 to 41 1\/2 , Delta Air Lines , which fell 7 3\/4 to 69 1\/4 , and Philips Industries , which sank 3 to 21 1\/2 . 
But as panic spread , speculators began to sell blue-chip stocks such as Philip Morris and International Business Machines to offset their losses .

, while IBM closed 5 5\/8 lower at 102 . 
when prices fall to certain levels . 
Traders said most of their major institutional investors , on the other hand , sat tight . 
as the S&P 500 futures contract had plunged 12 points , equivalent to around a 100-point drop in the Dow industrials . 
, and specialists continued to notch prices down . 
As a result , the link between the futures and stock markets ripped apart . 
, '' said a managing director at one of the largest program-trading firms . 
But stocks kept falling . 
Meanwhile , during the the S&P trading halt , S&P futures sell orders began piling up , while stocks in New York kept falling sharply . 
, while stocks in New York kept falling sharply . 
as the market was falling -RRB- was talking on an `` inter-exchange hot line '' to the other exchanges , the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Board . 
, and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line . 
But the build-up of S&P futures sell orders weighed on the market , and the link with stocks began to fray again .

, and trading was locked again .

However , Jeffrey B. Lane , president of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , said that Friday 's plunge is `` going to set back '' relations with customers , `` because it reinforces the concern of volatility .

But nobody knows at what level the futures and stocks will open today . 
But the exchange will `` look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks . 
But specialists complain privately that just as in the 1987 crash , the `` upstairs '' firms -- big investment banks that support the market by trading big blocks of stock -- stayed on the sidelines during Friday 's blood-letting . 
since England has been a kingdom . 
Earlier the company announced it would sell its aging fleet of Boeing Co. 707s because of increasing maintenance costs .

but that he would review it and bring it to the attention of the creditors committee . 
, and Mr. Simpson said he resigned in 1988 . 
In addition , Robert Sakowitz , chief executive of the Sakowitz chain , is seeking funds to buy out the Hooker interest in his company . 
, but they have the potential to be so , '' said Mr. Shidler . 
. 
And many fund managers have built up cash levels and say they will be buying stock this week . 
and say they will be buying stock this week . 
, but it was still at just half the level of the weekend preceding Black Monday in 1987 . 
because any fund exchanges made after Friday 's close would take place at today 's closing prices . 
But fund managers say they 're ready . 
Mario Gabelli , for instance , holds cash positions well above 20 % in several of his funds . 
Also , persistent redemptions would force some fund managers to dump stocks to raise cash . 
But a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around , fund managers said . 
, but monthly net purchases are still running at less than half 1987 levels . 
And today he 'll be looking to buy drug stocks like Eli Lilly , Pfizer and American Home Products whose dividend yields have been bolstered by stock declines . 
after the stock got hammered .

But most investors were seeking share prices and other information . 
Still , fund groups are n't taking any chances . 
In addition , East Coast centers will open at 7:30 EDT this morning , instead of the normal 8:30 . 
But most investors seemed to be `` in an information mode rather than in a transaction mode , '' said Steven Norwitz , a vice president . 
And Vanguard , among other groups , said it was adding more phone representatives today to help investors get through . 
before prices stabilize . 
But she expects prices to rebound soon and is telling investors she expects the stock market wo n't decline more than 10 % to 15 % from recent highs .

Nevertheless , Ms. Garzarelli said she was swamped with phone calls over the weekend from nervous shareholders .

and the market was very overvalued , they say . 
as America West Airlines announced it will postpone its new service out of Houston because of delays in receiving aircraft from the Seattle jet maker . 
'' and that more than 500 passengers who were booked to fly out of Houston on America West would now be put on other airlines . 
Boeing is also supposed to send to America West another 757 twin-engine aircraft as well as a 737 by year 's end . 
Nevertheless , the company 's reaction underscores the domino effect that a huge manufacturer such as Boeing can have on other parts of the economy . 
It also is sure to help the machinists put added pressure on the company . 
America West , though , is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be . 
and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be . 
Indeed , a random check Friday did n't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations . 
and that it was impossible to predict what further disruptions might be triggered by the strike . 
Meanwhile , supervisors and non-striking employees have been trying to finish some 40 aircraft -- mostly 747 and 767 jumbo jets at the company 's Everett , Wash. , plant -- that were all but completed before the walkout . 
and a fifth plane , a 747-400 , was supposed to be flown out over the weekend to Air China . 
before they come back , '' said Doug Hammond , the federal mediator who has been in contact with both sides since the strike began .

and that things look very rosy for Boeing in the long term , '' said Howard Rubel , an analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc . 
But Mr. Baker said he thinks the earliest a pact could be struck would be the end of this month , hinting that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week . 
Still , he said , it 's possible that the strike could last considerably longer . 
But Mr. Baker called the letter -- and the company 's offer of a 10 % wage increase over the life of the pact , plus bonuses -- `` very weak . '' 
The union is continuing to work through its expired contract , however . 
, but that has been pushed back indefinitely . 
, while it continues bargaining . 
-- And Boeing on Friday said it received an order from Martinair Holland for four model 767-300 wide-body jetliners valued at a total of about $ 326 million .

And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them . 
after Mr. Stookey took the chief executive 's job in 1986 . 
, but he has consistently argued that over the long haul -- across both the peaks and the troughs of the plastics market -- Quantum will prosper through its new direction . 
But its competitors -- including Dow Chemical Co. , Union Carbide Corp. and several oil giants -- have much broader business interests and so are better cushioned against price swings .

Meanwhile , the price of ethylene , the chemical building block of polyethylene , has n't dropped nearly so fast . 
, because its own plants cover only about half of its ethylene needs . 
Calculating that excess polyethylene would soon be sloshing around the world , other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new product .

Some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to dispel takeover speculation . 
since Mr. Stookey deflected dividend questions in a Sept. 29 meeting with analysts . 
But others came away thinking he had given something less than his usual straight-from-the-shoulder performance .

By lifting ethylene production , the expansion will also lower the company 's raw material costs .

Meanwhile , the U.S. has negotiated a significant cut in Japan 's steel quota , and made only a minor increase to the steel allotment for the European Community . 
Other countries that do n't have formal steel quotas with the U.S. , such as Taiwan , Sweden and Argentina , also have supplied steel . 
It also said it would use that two-and-a-half year period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade , which has been notoriously managed , subsidized and protected by governments . 
if a joint Korean-U.S. steel project is included . 
Meanwhile , Brazil is expected to increase its allowance from the 1.43 % share it has had in recent years . 
But its quota has been as high as 6.9 % in 1984 . 
Japan , however , has agreed to cut its quota to about 5 % from 5.9 % previously .

Although Mr. Pierce expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year , he said Elcotel will also benefit from moving into other areas . 
Elcotel has also developed an automatic call processor that will make further use of the company 's system for automating and handling credit-card calls and collect calls . 
The company will also be producing a new line of convenience telephones , which do n't accept coins , for use in hotel lobbies , office lobbies , hospitality lounges and similar settings .

It also marks P&G 's growing concern that its Japanese rivals , such as Kao Corp. , may bring their superconcentrates to the U.S. .

since it 's already expanded its best-selling Tide into 16 different varieties , including this year 's big hit , Tide with Bleach . 
With superconcentrates , however , it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more ; many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine , believing that it takes a cup of powder to really clean the laundry . 
But the product , which was n't as concentrated as the new Cheer , bombed in a market test in Denver and was dropped . 
P&G and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on detergent and fabric softener combinations in pouches , but they have n't sold well , despite the convenience .

Instead , they got a discussion of the need for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view . 
But Mrs. Hills , speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in Japan on Saturday , stressed that the objective `` is not to get definitive action by spring or summer , it is rather to have a blueprint for action . ''

But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic . 
And some said it reflected the growing debate in Washington over pursuing free trade with Japan versus some kind of managed trade . 
, but as a general proposition , I think we have a very consistent trade strategy in the Bush administration . '' 
Yet more than one American official who sat in with her during three days of talks with Japanese officials said her tone often was surprisingly `` conciliatory . '' 
, perhaps because I have a ferocious list of statutes to implement .

But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition . 
`` But I am relieved to see that you are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and a person of integrity . ''

But she stressed , `` I am against managed trade .

But the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted wo n't be felt until the second half of next year . 
For example , in the Oklahoma panhandle , 40 % or more of the topsoil is short of moisture .

But are these four players , three of them in their 80s , ready to assume a different role after 88 years , collectively , of service on the high court ? 
But always , in years past , they have bucked the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to eke out a number of major victories in civil rights and liberties cases .

Justice Blackmun , who will turn 81 next month , also seems feisty about his new role . 
And his outlook improved after successful cataract surgery in August .

These `` clean-bank '' transactions leave the bulk of bad assets , mostly real estate , with the government , to be sold later . 
In these four , for instance , the RTC is stuck with $ 4.51 billion in bad assets . 
The buyers will also be locked into deposit rates for just two weeks , as has been the case with previous deals .

For example , the delay in selling People 's Heritage Savings , Salina , Kan. , with $ 1.7 billion in assets , has forced the RTC to consider selling off the thrift branch-by-branch , instead of as a whole institution . 
NCNB also acquired Freedom Savings & Loan Association , Tampa , Fla. , which had total assets of $ 900 million . NCNB will pay the RTC a premium of $ 40.4 million for $ 1.1 billion in deposits .

However , because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered , ad rates will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber , according to Richard Heinemann , Time associate publisher .

But Time , as part of the more cost-conscious Time Warner , wants to wean itself away from expensive gimmicks .

But for all its success , CNN has hit a plateau . 
. 
when big news breaks , it ebbs during periods of calm . 
as the alternatives multiply for news and information on cable-TV . 
So CNN , a unit of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc. , is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel , or what people in the television industry call a `` top of mind '' network . 
To distinguish itself , CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program . 
And it is embarking on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large investigative-reporting team . 
But that wo n't be easy . 
It also takes money that CNN has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see . 
And the cable-TV operators -- CNN 's distributors and part owners -- like things just the way they are . 
as the cable-TV news market grows more competitive . 
In addition , many cable-TV systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations . 
as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to cable-TV channels . 
, so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks .

Accordingly , CNN is adding a world-affairs show in the morning because surveys show its global-news hour in the afternoon is among its most `` differentiated '' programs in viewers ' minds , says Mr. Amos .

Then there 's `` The World Today , '' the prime-time newscast featuring Mr. Shaw and Ms. Crier .

But to improve , they 've really got to make the investment in people . ''

Accordingly , CityFed estimated that it will provide between $ 85 million and $ 110 million for credit losses in the third quarter . 
Mr. Atherton said CityFed will also mark its portfolio of high-yield corporate bonds to market as a result of federal legislation requiring that savings institutions divest themselves of such bonds .

Regulators also ordered CenTrust to stop buying back the preferred stock . 
until its operations were on track . 
, but CenTrust has said it ca n't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market . 
He also said substantial reserves have been set aside for possible losses from the junk bonds . 
In the third quarter , for instance , CenTrust added $ 22.5 million to its general reserves . 
Mr. Paul said the regulators should instead move ahead with approving CenTrust 's request to sell 63 of its 71 branches to Great Western Bank , a unit of Great Western Financial Corp. based in Beverly Hills , Calif . 
CenTrust , however , touts the branch sale , saying it would bring in $ 150 million and reduce the thrift 's assets to $ 6.7 billion from $ 9 billion . 
, thus bringing CenTrust close to regulatory standards . 
CenTrust said the branch sale would also reduce the company 's large amount of good will by about $ 180 million . 
Critics , however , say the branch sale will make CenTrust more dependent than ever on brokered deposits and junk bonds .

Iowa , for instance , saw its population grow by 11,000 people , or 0.4 % , between 1987 and 1988 , the Census Bureau says . 
Still , even that modest increase is good news for a state that had n't grown at all since 1981 . 
And although Pennsylvania and Massachusetts suffered slight declines earlier in the decade , they are growing again .

, because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason 's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language . 
In addition , some of Mr. Mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism . 
For example , the New York state counsel for the NAACP said that Mr. Mason is `` like a dinosaur . People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck . '' 
, and it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves . 
But wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason , it is a constructive form of mischief .

And it has remained there , as evidenced by its reappearance in a 1972 CBS sitcom called `` Bridget Loves Bernie , '' whose sole distinction was that it led to the real-life marriage of Meredith Baxter and David Birney .

To the detriment of many low-income people , efforts to boost Medicaid funding , especially in rural areas , also were stricken . 
, others said , because there were no exceptions : all revenue-losing provisions were stricken . 
The Senate also dropped a plan by its Finance Committee that would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their Social Security benefits reduced . 
In addition , the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a 3 % excise tax on long-distance telephone calls . 
It also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current retirees . 
Also stricken was a fivefold increase in the maximum Occupational Safety and Health Administration penalties , which would have raised $ 65 million in fiscal 1990 .

-LRB- Of course , we 've also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective . -RRB- 
. 
But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to American notions of liberty and freedom than any incompetency -LRB- and , yes , maybe criminality -RRB- within HUD could possibly generate . 
Thus , in a criminal case , a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness , thus forcing him to `` take the Fifth . '' 
nor can the defendant be compelled to take the stand as a witness , thus forcing him to `` take the Fifth . '' 
, thus forcing him to `` take the Fifth . '' 
The privilege , however , has been limited in accordance with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only . 
The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that `` the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the inference where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause . '' 
Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter . 
, and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter . 
only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution . 
, but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . 
is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony harms him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . 
Thus , when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding , particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a good-faith , justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution .

, and the stock market plummeted nearly 200 points . 
Or is triskaidekaphobia -- fear of the number 13 -- justified ? 
But their study , which spanned the 1962-85 period , has since been shown to be jinxed by an unlucky choice of data . 
But the date tends to be a plus , not a minus , for stocks , according to Yale Hirsch , a collector of stock market lore . 
. 
and trading activity escalated , some phone calls to market makers in over-the-counter stocks went unanswered . 
Nonetheless , the Nasdaq Composite Index suffered its biggest point decline of the year and its sixth worst ever , diving 14.90 , or 3 % , to 467.29 . 
By comparison , the New York Stock Exchange Composite tumbled 5.8 % Friday and the American Stock Exchange Composite fell 4 % .

because it was just impossible to get stock moved , '' said E.E. `` Buzzy '' Geduld , president of Herzog , Heine , Geduld , a New York company that makes markets in thousands of OTC issues . 
But , he added , `` you can only take one call at a time . '' 
when imbalances occur . 
when no one else is willing to . 
. 
But , with profits sagging on Wall Street since the crash , companies have kept smaller share stockpiles on hand . 
, as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares . 
So , while OTC companies incurred losses on Friday , trading officials said the damage was n't as bad as it was in 1987 . 
. 
and that was the big culprit . 
Nevertheless , the shock of another steep plunge in stock prices undoubtedly will shake many investors ' confidence . 
. 
But they are worried . 
But grateful traders said the sell orders generally ranged from 20,000 shares to 50,000 shares , compared with blocks of 500,000 shares or more two years ago .

In addition , he said , some bigger institutional investors placed bids to buy some OTC stocks whose prices were beaten down . 
In addition , Mr. DaPuzzo said computer-guided program selling of OTC stocks in the Russell Index of 2000 small stocks and the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock Index sent occasional `` waves `` through the market . 
But they fell sharply . 
McCaw Cellular Communications , for instance , has offered to buy LIN Broadcasting as well as Metromedia 's New York City cellular telephone interests , and in a separate transaction , sell certain McCaw properties to Contel Cellular . McCaw lost 8 % , or 3 1\/2 , to 40 . LIN Broadcasting , dropped 5 1\/2 , or 5 % , to 107 1\/2 . 
The issues of companies with ties to the junk bond market also tumbled Friday . 
and Nike dropped 2 1\/4 to 66 3\/4 . 
And they plan to buy more today .

But their 1987 performance indicates that they wo n't abandon stocks unless conditions get far worse .

when investors rush to withdraw money , big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock . 
, because stocks have proved to be the best-performing long-term investment , attracting about $ 1 trillion from pension funds alone . 
, '' said Stephen B. Timbers , chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc . 
, and that they ca n't react to short-term events , good or bad , '' said Stephen L. Nesbitt , senior vice president for the pension consultants Wilshire Associates in Santa Monica , Calif . 
, '' he said , `` so I doubt you 'll see any significant changes '' in institutional portfolios as a result of Friday 's decline . 
and still have a good year in the market , '' said James D. Awad , president of New York-based BMI Capital Corp . 
Mr. Awad , however , worries that the market `` could go down 800 or 900 points in the next few days .

Meanwhile , Friday brought a reprieve for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally .

, but we had a good day . 
Mr. Nesbit also said the FDA has asked Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. to recall at the retail level its urinary tract antibiotic . 
But so far the company has n't complied with that request , the spokesman said . 
Bolar , of Copiague , N.Y. , earlier began a voluntary recall of both its 100 milligram and 50 milligram versions of the drug . 
because the lawsuit ASKO plans to file would be the first to challenge the entire principle and practice of companies issuing voting preferred shares to management-controlled trusts to dilute voting power of common stockholders . 
, ASKO will then ask the court to overturn such a vote-diluting maneuver recently deployed by Koninklijke Ahold NV . 
and thus dilute the worth and voting power of ASKO and other shareholders . 
Speaking through its Dutch lawyers , ASKO also disclosed it holds a 15 % stake in Ahold . 
It was previously thought ASKO held a 13.6 % stake that was accumulated since July . 
, but on Friday morning he had few kind words for President Bush 's economic policy-making . 
, and I have n't . 
, although many analysts doubt that Washington was singly responsible for Wall Street 's woes . 
But Mr. Butcher 's comments make one thing clear : Some on Wall Street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy . 
because Congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit-cutting bill . 
But he has since run into opposition from the Treasury and the White House over that decision . 
And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines , which includes a big stake by British Airways PLC . 
and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold . 
, although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the Federal Reserve . 
And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee rather than the Transportation Department -- were making markets nervous . 
-- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ 12 billion during that period . 
But , barring further drops in the market this week , a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year . 
But administration officials privately agree with Mr. Panetta , who said a precipitous drop this week `` is going to force the president and Congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy . '' 
-- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , '' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- . 
and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , '' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- . 
Nevertheless , it clearly will take more than Friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and White House Budget Director Richard Darman over the capital-gains fight . 
because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal , '' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- said yesterday on CBS News 's `` Face the Nation . '' 
. 
, and the best way to do that is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill '' of similar provisions , Sen. Warren Rudman -LRB- R. , N.H . -RRB- . said yesterday . 
Rep. Panetta said that OMB 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : `` We 're getting very close to the margins here . '' 
, but added : `` We 're getting very close to the margins here . '' 
But some players were quick to seize the moment .

, but most seemed to be taking a philosophical approach and said they were resigned to riding out the latest storm in the stock market . 
as he watched the market plunge on a big screen in front of a brokerage firm . 
But he 's not so sure about everyone else . 
`` And I think institutions are going to come in and buy ...

when the market started to slide Friday . 
But Robert Showalter , an official of the association , said no special bulletins or emergency meetings of the investors ' clubs are planned . 
In fact , some of the association 's members -- long-term , buy-and-hold investors -- welcomed the drop in prices . 
if the prices drop to the level he wants . 
Not everyone is reacting so calmly , however , and many wonder about the long-term implications of what is widely viewed as the cause of Friday 's slide , reluctance by banks to provide financing for a buy-out of UAL Corp. , parent of United Airlines .

Still , he adds : `` We ca n't have this kind of thing happen very often .

, and two others have introduced even smaller `` palmtops . '' 
But those machines are still considered novelties , with keyboards only a munchkin could love and screens to match . 
Compaq 's notebooks , by contrast , may be the first in their weight class not to skimp on features found in much bigger machines . 
-- and they 're priced aggressively at $ 2,400 to $ 5,000 . 
and that are called notebooks -- perhaps misleadingly .

Some critics , however , say its ability to run commonplace programs is restricted by a limited memory . 
Poquet Computer Corp. , meanwhile , has introduced a much more sophisticated palmtop that can run Lotus 1-2-3 and other sophisticated software programs , but costs five times as much . 
Responding to that demand , however , has led to a variety of compromises . 
It also has precluded use of the faster , more powerful microprocessors found in increasing numbers of desktop machines . 
Size and weight considerations also have limited screen displays . 
A Poquet spokesman , for example , criticizes the Atari Portfolio because it requires three batteries while the Poquet needs only two .

-- a problem Poquet also encountered in focus groups , admits Gerry Purdy , director of marketing . 
But the Dynabook product is twice as heavy and costs more than Compaq 's . 
Compaq 's announcement also spells trouble for Zenith , which last year had 28 % of the U.S. laptop market but recently agreed to sell its computer business to Cie. des Machines Bull , the French government-owned computer maker . 
because it is pegged to Zenith 's share and sales . 
, whereas Compaq 's new machines use the more common 3 1\/2-inch disk . 
'' when they first replaced five-inch disks . 
, but most analysts believe Compaq has at least a six-month lead on the competition . 
Toshiba 's line of portables , for example , features the T-1000 , which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory , and the T-1600 , which also uses a 286 microprocessor , but which weighs almost twice as much and is three times the size .

But Mr. Treybig questions whether that will be enough to stop Tandem 's first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from Big Blue 's machines . 
Nevertheless , Tandem faces a variety of challenges , the biggest being that customers generally view the company 's computers as complementary to IBM 's mainframes . 
and it took the wind out of a previously irrepressible dollar .

, partly because the two years following the worst stock-market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable .

But if the stock market does n't continue to plummet , the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate .

But the experience of the 1987 crash suggests the Fed is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to calm markets .

Once the chief beneficiaries of the industry 's now fading boom , these producers also will be reporting against exceptionally strong performances in the 1988 third quarter .
