Report says Israeli air strike targeted Syrian nuclear reactor Israel 's air strike on Syria last month was an attempt to knock out a partially constructed nuclear reactor , according to officials with access to American and Israeli intelligence reports , the The New York Times reported on Sunday .

Investigations suggest that many cases of sexual abuse are never reported 
The cases do not always include enough evidence 
When sexual misconduct is reported , teachers , administrators and some parents frequently can not , either subconsciously or consciously , recognize the warning signs of a crime 
After examining records in all 50 states and the District of Columbia , the AP found that 2,570 educators had their teaching licenses taken away , denied , surrendered voluntarily or restricted from the period of 2001 through 2005 , all as a result of sexual misconduct allegations 
Minors were the victims in at least 1,801 of the cases 
More than half of the educators who were disciplined by their state governments 
While certain educators were accused of sexual misconduct in school , others were cited for abuse that occurred after hours and did not always involve one of their own students 
A preponderance of cases involved teachers in public schools 
A preponderance of cases involved teachers in public schools since many private schools do not require their teachers to be licensed

`` If there 's one incident of sexual misconduct between a teacher and a student that 's one too many

However , while the AP found attempts to stop particular offenders , it also discovered a firm resistance towards identifying and preventing abuse 
School administrators cut backdoor deals to sidestep lawsuits or bad press . 
And in state governments and Congress , lawmakers are weary to impose harsher punishments or any national policy in fear of harming an important profession . 
For example , in the state of California , some of the most sadistic sex abuse is flagged 
For example , in the state of California , some of the most sadistic sex abuse is flagged , but state law allows a multitude of offenses to remain confidential in disciplinary records
