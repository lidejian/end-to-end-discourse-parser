that the U.S. faces a multifaceted housing crisis -- reduced affordability of homes for first-time buyers, increased homelessness, and lower apartment construction rates -- that will be "very difficult" to solve "without expanded federal resources.NAHB support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch
But NAHB support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch; over the years the NAHB has backed a host of public programs.the NAHB remains susceptible to internal pressure from members that specialize in subsidized production
Though Mr. Colton says expanding FHA lending would result in "no cost to the government," the mere diversion of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing (such as low-income) to the single-family home market would result in a major expense
The federal government has had to pump in $2.28 billion into the VA housing program since 1984 to keep the fund afloat and the VA requested an additional $120 million for the fiscal year just ended
In its nicely produced publication "Where Will Our Children Live?" the NAHB does acknowledge that "of course, the full measure of housing affordability cannot be provided by the federal government." It points to the pernicious impact of local government regulation, particularly zoning and building fees, which pushes the price of housing out of the reach of low- and middle-income people.But while the NAHB has suggested actions that states and localities should take to reduce regulatory barriers, the association has proposed no activist legislative program -- comparable to, say, its detailed request for more federal subsidies -- to eliminate counterproductive controls
while the NAHB has suggested actions that states and localities should take to reduce regulatory barriers, the association has proposed no activist legislative program -- comparable to, say, its detailed request for more federal subsidies -- to eliminate counterproductive controls

The only strong opposition to changing the EC treaty comes from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.the process of convening the intergovernmental conference doesn't require unanimity
French President Francois Mitterrand fought to set a date for the conference during the EC summit in Madrid last June, but the move was scuttled because of opposition by Mrs. Thatcher and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl

Although the union-bidder expects to patch together a substitute offer, consisting of less cash, the failure to get cash from Japanese and American banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the pageant of high-leverage takeover deals is ending
As usual, few favorable reviews were heard for that ever-present marching band of program traders, although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write
As usual, few favorable reviews were heard for that ever-present marching band of program traders.What really spooked the crowds along Wall Street was the sudden concern that, whatever the reason, the pool of debt capital is drying up
Gray Friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers, rather than the small investor, as their highly margined investments in the "deal" stocks are jeopardized by the unexpected drying up of the lubricant for deal financing
Deal stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses
Investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by Ohio Mattress and by forcing Ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring.high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $11 billion in junk bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times

Of course, Washington hadn't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle, and its tendency to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect, but those preliminary steps shouldn't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that was at work on Friday
If it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused Gray Friday, what are the implications for policy makers
takeover premiums become excessive.the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers, and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions
LBO dealmakers become too aggressive, then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers, and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions
then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers, and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions
Yes, the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral, but they rode the tiger up all year
The arbitragers and takeover initiatiors got killed on Gray Friday, while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily
If you identify with the besieged managers, you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington
If you side with the arbitragers and raiders, you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators
you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators, although the Delaware courts should never be underestimated
Although the average citizen is probably not harmed too much from Washington's rhetorical war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial leveraging, actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm
