When the price of plastics took off in 1987, Quantum Chemical Corp. went along for the ride
The timing of Quantum's chief executive officer, John Hoyt Stookey, appeared to be nothing less than inspired, because he had just increased Quantum's reliance on plastics
The company outpaced much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew fivefold in two years
When the price of plastics took off in 1987, Quantum Chemical Corp. went along for the ride.now prices have nose-dived and Quantum's profit is plummeting
But now prices have nose-dived and Quantum's profit is plummeting
Pricing cycles, to be sure, are nothing new for plastics producers.And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them
the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics after Mr. Stookey took the chief executive's job in 1986
Mr. Stookey, 59 years old, declined to be interviewed for this article, but he has consistently argued that over the long haul -- across both the peaks and the troughs of the plastics market -- Quantum will prosper through its new direction
Quantum's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene resin.its competitors -- including Dow Chemical Co., Union Carbide Corp. and several oil giants -- have much broader business interests
But its competitors -- including Dow Chemical Co., Union Carbide Corp. and several oil giants -- have much broader business interests and so are better cushioned against price swings
When the price of polyethylene moves a mere penny a pound, Quantum's annual profit fluctuates by about 85 cents a share, provided no other variables are changing
In recent months the price of polyethylene, even more than that of other commodity plastics, has taken a dive.the price of ethylene, the chemical building block of polyethylene, hasn't dropped nearly so fast
That discrepancy hurts Quantum badly, because its own plants cover only about half of its ethylene needs

Whether a cash crunch might eventually force the company to cut its quarterly dividend has become a topic of intense speculation on Wall Street since Mr. Stookey deflected dividend questions in a Sept. 29 meeting with analysts

The move stems from lessons learned in Japan where local competitors have had phenomenal success with concentrated soapsuds.It also marks P&G's growing concern that its Japanese rivals, such as Kao Corp., may bring their superconcentrates to the U.S
the company will study results from this market before expanding to others
The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after watching the success of Attack
When Attack hit the shelves in 1987, P&G's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8% from more than 20%
While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products, the true test for P&G will be in the $4 billion U.S. detergent market
where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders
The company may have chosen to market the product under the Cheer name since it's already expanded its best-selling Tide into 16 different varieties, including this year's big hit, Tide with Bleach
With the help of Lemon Cheer, P&G's share is now estimated to be 12%.With superconcentrates it isn't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more
In the early 1980s, P&G tried to launch here a concentrated detergent under the Ariel brand name that it markets in Europe.But the product, which wasn't as concentrated as the new Cheer, bombed in a market test in Denver and was dropped

A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New York City.Or so it must seem to Jackie Mason, the veteran Jewish comedian appearing in a new ABC sitcom airing on Tuesday nights (9:30-10 p.m. EDT)

that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks, so they support black candidates uncritically
that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination, so they, too, support black candidates uncritically
He said Jews were "sick with complexes"; and he called David Dinkins, Mr. Giuliani's black opponent, "a fancy shvartze with a mustache
If Mr. Mason had used less derogatory language to articulate his amateur analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New Yorkers, would the water be quite so hot
It probably would, because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language
because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason's remarks have bothered to distinguish between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used insulting language.some of Mr. Mason's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism
In addition, some of Mr. Mason's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of racism.the New York state counsel for the NAACP said that Mr. Mason is "like a dinosaur.People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck
The latter typically is the humor of the underdog, and it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves
In the hands of a zealot like Lenny Bruce, this double-edged blade could cut both the self and the audience to ribbons.But wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason, it is a constructive form of mischief
Why constructive?Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing, they are similar in one respect: Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict
Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer
group conflicts still exist.what other means do we have for letting off steam
if group conflicts still exist.if Mr. Mason's type of ethnic humor is passe
and if Mr. Mason's type of ethnic humor is passe
Don't say the TV sitcom, because that happens to be a genre that, in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody, resembles politics more than it does comedy
that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer: yuppies vs. blue-collar Bostonians in "Cheers"; children vs. adults in "The Cosby Show." But these are not the differences that make headlines
that the plot has entered the public domain.And it has remained there
Clearly, the question with "Chicken Soup" is not whether the pot will boil over, but whether it will simmer at all
To some extent, this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them.Michael dislikes Jackie not because he's a shrewd Jewish businessman, but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker
For instance, Michael dislikes Jackie.he's a shrewd Jewish businessman

For instance, Michael dislikes Jackie.but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker
The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end (and occasionally in the middle), when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself.But too often, these routines lack spark
But too often, these routines lack spark because this sitcom, like all sitcoms, is timid about confronting Mr. Mason's stock in trade-ethnic differences
That issue, like racial tensions in New York City, will have to cool down, not heat up, before it can simmer
I'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic-Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz.I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about "caring for other people" that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America
