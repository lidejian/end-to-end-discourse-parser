Investigations suggest that many cases of sexual abuse are never reported, and those that are reported often do not lead to punishment for the offender
The cases do not always include enough evidence, and for this as well as other reasons the schools, courts, state governments, and federal governments cannot be sure that they are keeping sexual deviants out of teaching

Minors were the victims in at least 1,801 of the cases, and more than 80 percent of those minors were students of the accused criminals

While certain educators were accused of sexual misconduct in school, others were cited for abuse that occurred after hours and did not always involve one of their own students
A preponderance of cases involved teachers in public schools since many private schools do not require their teachers to be licensed and most private schools do not allow their disciplinary records to be publicly viewed
since many private schools do not require their teachers to be licensed and most private schools do not allow their disciplinary records to be publicly viewed

namely that concentrations of CO2 are increasing at much higher rates than previously expected and this is in spite of the Kyoto Protocol that is designed to hold them down in western countries
