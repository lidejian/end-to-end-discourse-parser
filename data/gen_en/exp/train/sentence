Just the thing for the Vivaldi-at-brunch set, the yuppie audience that has embraced New Age as its very own easy listening.But you can't dismiss Mr. Stoltzman's music or his motives as merely commercial and lightweight
He believes in what he plays, and he plays superbly
that his new album, "Inner Voices," had just been released, that his family was in the front row, and that it was his mother's birthday
and that it was his mother's birthday, so he was going to play her favorite tune from the record
He launched into Saint-Saens's "The Swan" from "Carnival of the Animals," a favorite encore piece for cellists, with lovely, glossy tone and no bite.he offered the second movement from Saint-Saens's Sonata for Clarinet, a whimsical, puckish tidbit that reflected the flip side of the Stoltzman personality

Then, as if to show that he could play fast as well, he offered the second movement from Saint-Saens's Sonata for Clarinet, a whimsical, puckish tidbit that reflected the flip side of the Stoltzman personality. And so it went through the first half: an ingeniously chosen potpourri of pieces, none longer than five minutes, none that would disturb or challenge a listener
Mr. Stoltzman tied the composer in by proclaiming him "the great improviser of the 18th century," and then built on the image by joining with Mr. Douglas in some Bach two-part inventions

And so it went through the first half: an ingeniously chosen potpourri of pieces, none longer than five minutes, none that would disturb or challenge a listener.The end of the first half brought what the standing-room-only crowd seemed to be waiting for: the pop singer Judy Collins
Glamorous and pure-voiced as ever, Ms. Collins sang Joni Mitchell's "For Free" -- about an encounter with a street-corner clarinetist, to which Mr. Stoltzman contributed a clarinet obligatto -- and Mr. Douglas's lush setting of a Gaelic blessing, "Deep Peace." "Deep Peace" also featured a slide show of lovely but predictable images of clouds, beaches, deserts, sunsets, etc
It was all too mellow to be believed, but they probably would have gotten away with it, had they not felt compelled to add Ms. Collins's signature tune, "Amazing Grace," and ask for audience participation
Was this why some of the audience departed before or during the second half?Or was it because Ms. Collins had gone
Or was it because Ms. Collins had gone
Either way it was a pity, because Mr. Stolzman offered the most substantial music of the evening just after intermission: Steve Reich's "New York Counterpoint," one of a series of Reich works that juxtapose a live performer with recorded tracks of his or her own playing
He warned us in advance that "New York Counterpoint" lasts 11 1/2 minutes.He also unfortunately illustrated this intricate, jazzy tapestry with Mr. Pearson's images, this time of geometric or repeating objects, in a kitschy mirroring of the musical structure that was thoroughly distracting from Mr. Reich's piece and Mr. Stoltzman's elegant execution of it
It was enjoyable to hear accomplished jazz without having to sit in a smoke-filled club, but like the first half, much of it was easy to take and ultimately forgettable

that prevents the production of pollen.The gene thus can prevent a plant from fertilizing itself
The gene thus can prevent a plant from fertilizing itself.Such so-called male-sterile plants can then be fertilized by pollen from another strain of the plant
Such so-called male-sterile plants can then be fertilized by pollen from another strain of the plant, thereby producing hybrid seed
That's because the male part, the tassel, and the female, the ear, are some distance apart on the corn plant
They sow a row of male-fertile plants nearby, which then pollinate the male-sterile plants
The first hybrid corn seeds produced using this mechanical approach were introduced in the 1930s and they yielded as much as 20% more corn than naturally pollinated plants
In China, a great number of workers are engaged in pulling out the male organs of rice plants using tweezers, and one-third of rice produced in that country is grown from hybrid seeds
The sterilizing gene is expressed.the pollen is about to develop
The sterilizing gene is expressed just before the pollen is about to develop and it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the plant
At Plant Genetic Systems, researchers have isolated a pollen-inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility.The researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male-sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop
They attached a second gene, for herbicide resistance, to the pollen-inhibiting gene.Both genes are then inserted into a few greenhouse plants
Both genes are then inserted into a few greenhouse plants, which are then pollinated and allowed to mature and produce seed
that half of the plants springing from these greenhouse-produced seeds will be male sterile and herbicide resistant and half will be male fertile and herbicide susceptible
even though virtually all corn seeds currently planted are hybrids, the genetic approach will obviate the need for mechanical emasculation of anthers
One technique developed by some of these companies involves a chemical spray supposed to kill only a plant's pollen.But there have been problems with chemical sprays damaging plants' female reproductive organs and concern for the toxicity of such chemical sprays to humans, animals and beneficial insects
But there have been problems with chemical sprays damaging plants' female reproductive organs and concern for the toxicity of such chemical sprays to humans, animals and beneficial insects.the company's chemical spray overcomes these problems and is "gentle on the female organ

that he will relinquish the government's so-called golden share in the company as long as Jaguar shareholders agree
GM has been negotiating a friendly transaction with Jaguar that likely would involve joint ventures and an eventual stake of just under 30%. But the government's action, which caught Jaguar management flat-footed, may scuttle the GM minority deal by forcing it to fight for all of Jaguar
The share price was languishing at about 400 pence before Ford's Sept. 19 announcement of its interest in a minority stake
Such a countermove could end Jaguar's hopes for remaining independent and British-owned.But it isn't clear how long GM would be willing to fight Ford for Jaguar
It's either going to be a shootout, or there only may be one player in town
It is very hard to justify paying a silly price for Jaguar if an out-and-out bidding war were to start now
Jaguar officials in the U.S. noted that Ford, as Jaguar's largest shareholder, now has the power to call for such a meeting. U.S. auto analysts also noted that Ford is in the best position to benefit from the large number of Jaguar shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid
Jaguar's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened.fewer than 3% of its shares are owned by employees and management
Ford officials in the U.S. declined to comment on the British government's action or on any plans to call a special Jaguar shareholders meeting.But GM officials said they, too, were surprised by the move, which left them to "consider all our options and explore matters further

Some U.S. allies are complaining that President Bush is pushing conventional-arms talks too quickly, creating a risk that negotiators will make errors that could affect the security of Western Europe for years. Concerns about the pace of the Vienna talks are being registered at the Pentagon
Mr. Bush has called for an agreement by next September at the latest.But some American defense officials believe the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should take more time to examine the long-term implications of the options being considered
to keep some short-range nuclear weapons on their soil once Soviet armored forces are thinned out
that a reduction of NATO forces under a treaty will increase the possibility of a conventional Soviet attack unless the West retains a residual force of nuclear weapons in Europe
So far, no ally has complained openly, preserving the impression that NATO is in line with the Bush position that a quick agreement bringing Soviet conventional forces down to parity with NATO is the West's top bargaining priority. But even though NATO negotiators have only 10 months left under the Bush timetable, they are still wrestling over such seemingly fundamental questions as "What is a tank

The Soviets complicated the issue by offering to include light tanks, which are as light as 10 tons.Oleg A. Grinevsky, the chief Soviet negotiator in the conventional-arms talks, argued that this would mean the Soviets would have to destroy some 1,800 tanks, while the U.S. would lose none because it has no light tanks in Europe. But the issue is stickier than it seems
France, Britain and Italy all have light tanks they would like to keep out of the talks.And some U.S. Army analysts worry that the proposed Soviet redefinition is aimed at blocking the U.S. from developing lighter, more transportable, high-technology tanks
The Soviets insisted that aircraft be brought into the talks, then argued for exempting some 4,000 Russian planes because they are "solely defensive

The dispute over that issue, according to one U.S. official, is a "potential treaty stopper," and only President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev may be able to resolve it

The government's primary economic-forecasting gauge rose a slight 0.2% in September.the report offered little new information on the degree to which the U.S. economy is slowing
The small increase in the index of leading indicators does lend support to the view that the economy has slowed noticeably.However, it doesn't give much of a clue as to whether a recession is on the horizon
Although September's weakness followed two strong months for home sales, the decline supports other indications that the drop in mortgage rates earlier this year has had only a limited beneficial effect on the housing market
The September drop was the largest since a 19% drop in January 1982, but monthly changes in this measure are even less reliable than those in other economic indicators
Because the figures are based on a small sample.it is 90% confident only that new-home sales fell somewhere between 5% and 23% during the month

In another report yesterday, the Commerce Department said sales of new single-family houses plunged 14% in September to an annual rate of 618,000 from 719,000 in August.The declines were particularly pronounced in the Northeast and in the South, where Hurricane Hugo was a factor.

So far this year, 534,000 newly built homes have been sold, down 4.5% from the like months of 1988. The index of leading indicators got a major boost in September from a surge in consumer expectations as measured by the University of Michigan.This measure had dropped sharply in August.The Commerce Department said that as a result of a new adjustment to the formula used to calculate the index, the influence of this component has been reduced. Of the 11 components to the index, only three others rose in September: the money supply, the length of the average work week and stock prices. Several components that track the health of the manufacturing sector of the economy turned down in September.These include new orders for manufactured consumer goods, lead times on vendor deliveries, orders for new plant and equipment, and backlogs of orders for durable goods.the National Association of Manufacturers said yesterday a recent poll of 53 executives on its board found that 61% don't expect a recession to occur until 1991 or later

He probably didn't penetrate any top-secret files, but the KGB in East Berlin was willing to pay two of his associates, Peter Carl and Dirk Brezinski, $15,000 for some of the material Hess collected
Once his cuckoo's egg was laid, he could enter Unix and become a "super-user," with access to everything
Mr. Stoll was scanning the heavens at the Keck observatory of the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in 1986 when his grant ran low and he was asked to switch to helping run the lab's computers
Mr. Stoll suspected the intruder was one of those precocious students who has fun breaking into computers. But after much tracking, it became evident to Mr. Stoll, through various clues, that the hacker was not on the Berkeley campus or even in California
He made a midnight requisition of all the printers he could lay hands on so that he could monitor all the telephone lines coming into the lab's computers
After discovering that the hacker had taken over the dormant account of a legitimate user named Joe Sventek, he rigged up an alarm system, including a portable beeper, to alert him when Sventek came on the line

Mips Computer Systems Inc. today will unveil a new general-purpose computer that will compete with more expensive machines from companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp. The closely held Sunnyvale, Calif., company also will announce an agreement to supply computers to Control Data Corp
The machine is part of an effort by Mips to establish itself as a supplier of computers, not just of integrated-circuit technology.Mips also wants to wedge into markets other than traditional RISC applications such as engineering
The Control Data deal is a boon for Mips because it gives the the five-year-old company one more ally as it battles more established electronic concerns such as Sun, Hewlett-Packard Co., Motorola Inc. and Intel Corp. for the emerging market for RISC machines

The crowning moment in the career of Joseph F. O'Kicki came as 300 local and state dignitaries packed into his elegant, marble-columned courtroom here last year for his swearing in as President Judge of Cambria County
As the judge marched down the center aisle in his flowing black robe, he was heralded by a trumpet fanfare
To many, it was a ceremony more befitting a king than a rural judge seated in the isolated foothills of the southern Allegheny Mountains.But then Judge O'Kicki often behaved like a man who would be king -- and an arrogant and abusive one

While his case may be extreme, it reflects the vulnerability of many small communities to domineering judges
by reneging on a promise of a better paying job after pocketing a $500 bribe
that the judge once called her to his office while wearing nothing at all
Even if only some of the allegations stand up, however, they provide ample testimony to the awesome power of judges in rural communities
Some of the allegations are simply bizarre.Even if only some of the allegations stand up they provide ample testimony to the awesome power of judges in rural communities
That power can sometimes be abused.jurists in smaller jurisdictions operate without many of the restraints that serve as corrective measures in urban areas
Fear of alienating that judge is pervasive.lawyers think twice before appealing a judge's ruling, are reluctant to mount, or even support, challenges against him for re-election and are usually loath to file complaints that might impugn a judge's integrity
As a result lawyers think twice before appealing a judge's ruling
He graduated near the top of his class, serving on the school law review with Richard Thornburgh.It was also in law school that Mr. O'Kicki and his first wife had the first of seven daughters

He has been considered several times for appointments to federal district and appellate court vacancies in Pennsylvania.And when he ran unsuccessfully for a state appellate court seat in 1983, the Pennsylvania Bar Association rated him "one of the best available," after interviewing local lawyers

Eventually he began ducking out of his office rather than face the judge when he visited
When Mr. Green won a $240,000 verdict in a land condemnation case against the state in June 1983, he says Judge O'Kicki unexpectedly awarded him an additional $100,000

My name is judge," Judge O'Kicki told a car salesman in Ebensburg when he bought a new red Pontiac Sunbird in October 1984, according to the grand-jury report
The judge was considered imperious, abrasive and ambitious.despite the judge's imperial bearing, no one ever had reason to suspect possible wrongdoing
Until this came up and hit the press, there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong
The judge came under scrutiny in late 1987, after the state attorney general's office launched an unrelated investigation into corruption in Cambria County
When the judge bought his new Sunbird from James E. Black Pontiac-Cadillac in Ebensburg five years ago, the dealership had "certain apprehensions" about the judge's reputation, according to the grand-jury report
The dealership took the extra step of having all the paper work for the transaction pre-approved by Ebensburg's local lender, Laurel Bank. Then, as an additional precaution, the car dealership took the judge's photograph as he stood next to his new car with sales papers in hand -- proof that he had received the loan documents

how much oil man William Herbert Hunt will owe the government after his assets are liquidated
The surprise announcement came after the IRS broke off negotiations with Mr. Hunt on a settlement of the one-time tycoon's personal bankruptcy case
Although the action removes one obstacle in the way of an overall settlement to the case, it also means that Mr. Hunt could be stripped of virtually all of his assets if the Tax Court rules against him in a 1982 case heard earlier this year in Washington, D.C

We believe our decision to plead (guilty) to these charges is responsible and proper.And our action today will allow Gulf Power to avoid prolonged, distracting legal proceedings
for making illegal political contributions on its behalf. The Appleyard Agency allegedly made contributions from 1982 to 1984 to various funds for political candidates
The Appleyard Agency, for example, allegedly made contributions from 1982 to 1984 to various funds for political candidates, then submitted bills to Gulf Power
The contributions were funded by monthly payments of $1,000 to $2,000 to Appleyard in the guise of a "special production fee" -- in effect, hiding the nature of the payments from the Internal Revenue Service, federal prosecutors said. The government also indicated that former Gulf Power senior vice president Jacob F. "Jake" Horton was the mastermind behind the use of the ad agencies -- Appleyard, Dick Leonard Group II Inc. and Hemmer & Yates Corp. -- to make payments to various political candidates from 1981 to 1988
Mr. Horton, who oversaw Gulf Power's governmental-affairs efforts, died mysteriously in a plane crash in April after learning he might be fired following the uncovering of irregularities in a company audit

that the church has 10,000 or more full-time American members and 25,000 "associates." Some estimates have gone as high as 80,000 members.that at its publicity-seeking heights, as when it organized a spectacular Yankee Stadium bicentennial rally in 1976, there actually were only about 2,000 full-time Unification Church members in the U.S
For a while in the 1970s it seemed Mr. Moon was on a spending spree, with such purchases as the former New Yorker Hotel and its adjacent Manhattan Center; a fishing/processing conglomerate with branches in Alaska, Massachusetts, Virginia and Louisiana; a former Christian Brothers monastery and the Seagram family mansion (both picturesquely situated on the Hudson River); shares in banks from Washington to Uruguay; a motion picture production company, and newspapers, such as the Washington Times, the New York City Tribune (originally the News World), and the successful Spanish-language Noticias del Mundo. Yet these purchases can be misleading
Those teams of young fund-raisers selling flowers, peanuts or begging outright at traffic intersections brought in somewhere near $20 million a year during the mid-to-late 1970s, but those revenues were a pittance compared to the costs of Mr. Moon's lavish international conferences, speaking tours, and assorted land buys
Virginia Commonwealth University sociologist David Bromley has concluded that profitable operations in the U.S. have been the exceptions rather than the rule.Likewise, journalists John Burgess and Michael Isikoff of the Washington Post have estimated that at least $800 million was transferred from Japan to the U.S. to deal with the church's annual operating losses in this country
Start-up costs for the Washington Times alone were close to $50 million, and the total amount lost in this journalistic black hole was estimated at $150 million by 1984
According to veteran watchers of Unificationist affairs, such as Dr. J. Gordon Melton, director of the Institute for the Study of American Religion, almost all operations are being drastically reduced as Mr. Moon now concentrates more on developing his empire in the Far East
But that was not to be.Mr. Moon is in retreat, refocusing on the Far East

that Imelda Marcos wasn't brought to the U.S. against her will and that marital privileges, which protect spouses from incriminating each other, don't apply in her case
A federal judge ruled that Imelda Marcos wasn't brought to the U.S. against her will and that marital privileges, which protect spouses from incriminating each other, don't apply in her case.Judge John F. Keenan of New York ordered Mrs. Marcos to turn over to the court all pleadings and documents she may have filed in foreign countries in opposition to U.S. requests for evidence

The law is meant to overcome delays caused by defendants' use of foreign procedures to block U.S. requests for records.the documents could involve foreign business dealings or bank accounts
On the allegation of kidnapping, Judge Keenan wrote, "The suggestion that Mrs. Marcos was brought to this country against her will is unsupported by affidavit or affirmation." The judge also said the two marital testimonial privileges cited by Mrs. Marcos don't apply
The first one permits a witness to refuse to testify against her spouse.that privilege's purpose is "fostering harmony in marriage
Because Mr. Marcos died Sept. 28, the privilege can no longer apply
The second marital privilege cited by Mrs. Marcos protects confidential communications between spouses.that privilege is meant to protect private utterances -- not litigation papers filed with foreign governments, as Mrs. Marcos's attorneys maintained
Though Judge Keenan threw out most of Mrs. Marcos's objections, he agreed with one of her concerns: that turning over the foreign documents could violate the defendant's constitutional right against self-incrimination

They are useful to call public attention to grievances, but they have little value in educating anyone about the issues in dispute
Demonstrations are particularly apt to degenerate into criminal conduct when they leave the site of the grievance and become mobile
The crimes may appear small, but the prices can be huge

Mr. Phelan is an adroit diplomat who normally appears to be solidly in control of the Big Board's factions.But he has been getting heat from all sides over program trading
If bringing the message is a crime, I'm guilty of it

while it has got off to a slow start, is being supported by some big brokerage firms -- another member of Mr. Phelan's splintered constituency

The program trading situation seems to have driven individual investors as well as others out of the market, and even Europeans are suspicious
In coming days, when the Big Board formulates its responses to the program-trading problem, Mr. Phelan may take a more public role in the issue.For now Mr. Phelan said: "I refuse to get out there and tell everybody everything is hunky-dory.We have a major problem, and that problem is volatility

The move is sure to heighten concerns about increased Japanese investment in U.S. biotechnology firms.It is also likely to bolster fears that the Japanese will use their foothold in U.S. biotechnology concerns to gain certain trade and competitive advantages
Gen-Probe, an industry leader in the field of genetic probes last year signed an agreement for Chugai to exclusively market its diagnostic products in Japan for infectious diseases and cancer.Chugai agreed then to fund certain associated research and development costs
That arrangement apparently has worked well, and Thomas A. Bologna, president and chief executive officer of Gen-Probe, founded in 1983, said the sale of the company means "we will be able to concentrate on running the business rather than always looking for sources of financing
Because the U.S. leads in most areas of biotechnology -- largely because of research investment by the U.S. government -- the sale is sure to increase concerns that Japanese companies will buy American know-how and use it to obtain the upper hand in biotechnology trade and competition
that the sale will facilitate Gen-Probe's marketing of a diagnostic test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. Chugai also will help Gen-Probe with its regulatory and marketing expertise in Asia

Most murders are state crimes, so any federal capital-punishment law probably would turn out to be more symbolism than substance

after repeatedly failing to attach death-penalty amendments to unrelated legislation, have finally gotten a full-blown death-penalty bill through committee

to consider specific "aggravating" and "mitigating" factors before deciding whether to condemn someone to death
Since that 1976 ruling, 37 states have reintroduced the death penalty.But congressional Democrats have blocked the same from occurring at the federal level, with the exception of a 1988 law allowing capital punishment for certain drug-related homicides
The Thurmond bill would establish a federally administered death sentence for 23 crimes, most of which were formerly punishable by death under federal statutes that the Supreme Court invalidated.The Thurmond bill would also add five new crimes punishable by death, including murder for hire
The Thurmond bill would establish a federally administered death sentence for 23 crimes, most of which were formerly punishable by death under federal statutes that the Supreme Court invalidated.the Senate last week passed a bill permitting execution of terrorists who kill Americans abroad

if the Thurmond bill had been in effect in the past three years, according to a study by the Senate Judiciary Committee's Democratic staff
Republicans acknowledge that few people would be executed under the Thurmond bill, but they contend that isn't the point
Many scholars are of the opinion that the mere existence of the penalty deters many people from the commission of capital crimes.Executions, regardless of how frequently they occur, are also "proper retribution" for heinous crimes
the new federal drug-related crimes punishable by death since last November may result in a jump in capital sentences, though that hasn't happened so far
Before the bill left committee, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) attached an amendment that would allow a defendant to escape from a death sentence in jurisdictions shown to have meted out executions in a racist manner
A large number of studies suggest that state judges and juries have imposed the penalty in a racially discriminatory fashion.And the Kennedy amendment would invade not only federal but state sentencings, in two important ways
It would allow all defendants to introduce statistical evidence showing racially disproportionate application of the death penalty in the past.And it would shift the burden to prosecutors to disprove that discrimination caused any statistical racial disparities
Since most prosecutors wouldn't be able to demonstrate conclusively that racial considerations didn't affect sentencing, executions everywhere might come to a halt

Two of the major factors buoying prices, the prolonged strikes at the Highland Valley mine in Canada and the Cananea mine in Mexico, were finally resolved.Also, the premiums paid by the U.S. government on a purchase of copper for the U.S. Mint were lower than expected, and acted as a price depressant

When the Supreme Soviet passed laws on workers' rights in May 1987 and on self-managing cooperatives a year later, some Western observers assumed Mikhail Gorbachev had launched the Soviet Union on a course that would lead inevitably to the creation of a market economy
that Mr. Gorbachev might not survive the opposition that his reforms would arouse and that the whole process might be reversed
If Mr. Gorbachev's goal is the creation of a free market, he and these Western observers have good reason to fear for his future
If Mr. Gorbachev's goal is the creation of a free market, he and these Western observers have good reason to fear for his future, as economic liberalization within communist societies leads inexorably to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied by civil unrest
These fears were clearly apparent when, last week, Secretary of State James Baker blocked a speech by Robert Gates, deputy national security adviser and Soviet expert, on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of Mr. Gorbachev's economic reforms succeeding
These fears were clearly apparent when, last week, Secretary of State James Baker blocked a speech by Robert Gates, deputy national security adviser and Soviet expert, on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of Mr. Gorbachev's economic reforms succeeding. Yet the Soviet leader's readiness to embark on foreign visits and steady accumulation of personal power, particularly since the last Politburo reshuffle on Sept. 30, do not suggest that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika

that Mr. Gorbachev is on the verge of being toppled; nor does he look likely to reverse the powers of perestroika.is he so clever that he has achieved the political equivalent of making water run uphill
But is he so clever that he has achieved the political equivalent of making water run uphill?And has he truly persuaded the Communist Party to accept economic change of a kind that will, sooner or later, lead to its demise
An alternative and more convincing explanation, confirmed by recent events and a close inspection of the Gorbachev program, is that the new Soviet economic and social structures are intended to conform to a model other than that of the market.while the laws on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state, strict provisions are attached on how far this may lead to the development of a free market

The controls on cooperatives appeared relatively liberal when first introduced.But that changed following a resolution from the Supreme Soviet banning cooperatives from operating in some areas of the economy, and permitting activity in others only if the cooperatives are under contract to the state
and permitting activity in others only if the cooperatives are under contract to the state
All independent media activity is now illegal, which perhaps is not surprising, but so is the manufacture of perfume, cosmetics, household chemicals and sand candles
If Mr. Gorbachev is looking toward unleashing the productive forces of the market, these latest resolutions are nothing short of reckless
while Mr. Gorbachev wishes to move away from some rigid central controls, he is bent on creating economic structures of a kind that would scarcely find favor with the Austrian or Chicago schools of economic thought
We do not share this approach, since it would immediately destroy the social situation and disrupt all the processes in the country
Having rejected central economic planning for economic reasons, and the market for fear of the social (political) consequences, Mr. Gorbachev seeks a "third way" that would combine the discipline and controls of the former with the economic benefits of the latter.Mr. Gorbachev's proposals display a close conceptual resemblance to the tenets of Italian fascism, whose architects spoke specifically of a "third way": of having produced a historic synthesis of socialism and capitalism
The fascist concept of corporatism envisaged an "organic" society in which citizens were spiritually and morally unified, and prepared to sacrifice themselves for the nation.a parliamentary system based on abstract political rights and groups was held to cause, rather than resolve, conflict
The closeness of Soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of Mussolini was evident when Mr. Gorbachev presented his economic vision to the Soviet Congress
he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market
In doing so, he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market.Instead, he proposed a "law-governed economy," in which there would be a "clear-cut division between state direction of the economy and economic management
To ensure the loyalty of the business sector, Mr. Gorbachev may offer concessions and powers that will allow the business community to preserve its own interests, probably by restricting competition.However, Mr. Gorbachev must ensure that within this "alliance" the business sector remains subordinate to the party
that a cooperative be closed or its prices be reduced
The most important development in Mr. Gorbachev's policy for marginalizing the opposition movement is the claim that the U.S.S.R. also suffers from terrorism.Mr. Gorbachev would appear to see his central task as that of ensuring that foundations of an alliance among labor, capital and the state are properly laid before the demands for a multiparty system reach a crescendo

If Japanese companies are so efficient, why does Kawasaki-Rikuso Transportation Co. sometimes need a week just to tell its clients how soon it can ship goods from here to Osaka
Because the companies have lacked office computers considered standard equipment in the U.S. and Western Europe, Japanese corporations' reputation as hi-tech powerhouses is only half right
Their factories may look like sets for a Spielberg movie, but their offices, with rows of clerks hunched over ledgers and abacuses, are more like scenes from a Dickens novel

So far, all the studies have concluded that RU-486 is "safe." But "safe," in the definition of Marie Bass of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project, means "there's been no evidence so far of mortality
The drug seems to suppress ovulation for three to seven months after it is taken
Some women clearly have no trouble eventually conceiving again: The studies have reported repeaters in their programs.But there are no scientific data on this question
Rather ominously, rabbit studies reveal that RU-486 can cause birth defects.that the rabbit-test results could not be duplicated in rats and monkeys
which occurs even if the drug fails to induce an abortion
It typically takes from eight to 10 years to obtain the Food and Drug Administration's approval for a new drug, and the cost of testing and marketing a new drug can range from $30 million to $70 million
The Health and Human Services Department currently forbids the National Institutes of Health from funding abortion research as part of its $8 million contraceptive program.But the Population Council, a 37-year-old, $20 million nonprofit organization that has the backing of the Rockefeller and Mellon foundations and currently subsidizes most U.S. research on contraceptives, has recently been paying for U.S. studies of RU-486 on a license from its French developer, Roussel-Uclaf, a joint subsidiary of the German pharmaceutical company Hoechst and the French government
For a woman whose period is late, using RU-486 means no waiting, no walking past picket lines at abortion clinics, and no feet up in stirrups for surgery.It also means she will never have to know whether she had actually been pregnant
RU-486 is being administered in France only under strict supervision in the presence of a doctor.a woman who used RU-486 to have an abortion would have to make three trips to the clinic past those picket lines; an initial visit for medical screening and to take the pill, a second trip 48 hours later for the prostaglandin, administered either via injection or vaginal suppository, and a third trip a week later to make sure she has completely aborted
Thus, a woman who used RU-486 to have an abortion would have to make three trips to the clinic past those picket lines; an initial visit for medical screening (anemics and those with previous pregnancy problems are eliminated) and to take the pill, a second trip 48 hours later for the prostaglandin, administered either via injection or vaginal suppository, and a third trip a week later to make sure she has completely aborted.because timing is so critical with RU-486, she will learn, via a pelvic examination and ultrasound, not only that she is pregnant, but just how pregnant she is

That means that the U.S. trade deficit was running closer to $75 billion than to $95 billion in 1988, and $55 billion (annualized) rather than $80 billion in the first quarter of 1989. These revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar
Too early to tell, but a trade deficit that is significantly smaller than we imagined does suggest a review of our trade posture

Kidder, Peabody & Co., a unit of General Electric Co., announced it would stop doing stock-index arbitrage for its own account, and Merrill Lynch & Co. pulled out of the practice altogether
as he prepares to explain the exchange's position on program trading to key congressional regulators in a closed session tomorrow, according to exchange officials
The program-trading outcry was taken to a new level when giant Contel Corp. said it and 20 or more of the Big Board's listed companies are forming an unprecedented alliance to complain about the exchange's role in program trading
Merrill's move is one of the most sweeping program-trading pullbacks of recent days, because the big securities firm will no longer execute stock-index arbitrage trades for customers
and Merrill Lynch & Co. pulled out of the practice altogether.it is lobbying for significant regulatory controls on program trading, including tough margin -- or down-payment -- requirements and limits on price moves for program-driven financial futures
index arbitrage "has been clearly identified in the investing public's mind as a contributing factor to excess market volatility," so Merrill won't execute such trades until "effective controls" are in place
so Merrill won't execute such trades until "effective controls" are in place
so Merrill won't execute such trades until "effective controls" are in place.it would cease index arbitrage altogether
Last Thursday, PaineWebber Group Inc. also said it would cease index arbitrage altogether, but the firm wasn't as big an index arbitrager as Merrill is
Index arbitrage doesn't have a "negative impact on the market as a whole" and Kidder's customers were "sophisticated" enough to know that
Just a week ago, Mr. Carpenter staunchly defended index arbitrage at Kidder, the most active index-arbitrage trading firm on the stock exchange this year.Index arbitrage, Mr. Carpenter said last week, doesn't have a "negative impact on the market as a whole" and Kidder's customers were "sophisticated" enough to know that. But yesterday, Mr. Carpenter said big institutional investors told us they wouldn't do business with firms" that continued to do index arbitrage for their own accounts
Kidder denied that GE's chairman and chief executive, John F. Welch, had anything to do with Kidder's decision.But at least one chief executive said he called Mr. Welch to complain about Kidder's aggressive use of program trading, and other market sources said they understood that Mr. Welch received many phone calls complaining about Kidder's reliance on index arbitrage as a major business
But at least one chief executive said he called Mr. Welch to complain about Kidder's aggressive use of program trading, and other market sources said they understood that Mr. Welch received many phone calls complaining about Kidder's reliance on index arbitrage as a major business
Supporters of index arbitrage haven't been publicly sticking up for the trading strategy, as some did during the post-crash outcry of 1987.But Merrill Lynch, in its statement about pulling out of index arbitrage, suggested that the current debate has missed the mark
that "the causes of excess market volatility are far more complex than any particular computer trading strategy.Indeed, there are legitimate hedging strategies used by managers of large portfolios such as pension funds that involve program trading as a means of protecting the assets of their pension beneficiaries
Merrill's index arbitragers will continue to do other kinds of computer-assisted program trading, so there probably won't be any layoffs at the firm
But Merrill Lynch, in its statement about pulling out of index arbitrage, suggested that the current debate has missed the mark. Merrill said it continues to believe that "the causes of excess market volatility are far more complex than any particular computer trading strategy.Bear Stearns Chairman and Chief Executive Alan C. Greenberg said his firm will continue stock-index arbitrage for its clients
If they think they are going to stop index arbitrage by causing a few Wall Street firms to quit, they are crazy
Pressure from big institutional investors has been the major catalyst for Wall Street's program-trading pullback.And there was speculation yesterday that Fidelity Investments and other large mutual-fund companies might soon follow the lead of Kemper Corp. and other institutions in cutting off trading business to securities firms that do program trading
A Fidelity spokesman in Boston denied the speculation, saying the program-trading issue was more of a regulatory problem. But a much smaller mutual fund company, the USAA Investment Management Co. unit of USAA, San Antonio, Texas, said it informed nine national brokerage firms it will cease business with them unless they stop index-arbitrage trading

the federal appeals court ruling, which favored LTV, threatened to transform the agency from an insurer of troubled pension plans into an "open-ended source of industry bailouts." The ruling also may determine how quickly LTV is able to complete its Chapter 11 reorganization

Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant, but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells
An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged
Either copy can make the proteins needed to control cell growth, so for cancer to arise, both copies must be impaired
A person who is born with one defective copy of a suppressor gene, or in whom one copy is damaged early in life, is especially prone to cancer because he need only lose the other copy for a cancer to develop

after his mother had suffered the same fate when she was a baby
that little Will Quinlan had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene and faced no more risk than other children of developing the rare cancer
All this may not be obvious to the public, which is concerned about advances in treatment, but I am convinced this basic research will begin showing results there soon
Dr. Dryja made his retinoblastoma discovery in 1986.Then last spring, researchers reported finding a gene called p53 which, if impaired, turns healthy colon cells cancerous
if impaired, turns healthy colon cells cancerous
if people inherit defective versions of these genes, they are especially prone to cancer
The tumor developed when the second, normal copy also was damaged
when a pediatrician named Alfred G. Knudson Jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects.there was no way to prove Dr. Knudson's "two-hit" theory
Back then, scientists had no way of ferreting out specific genes, but under a microscope they could see the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain the genes
He assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer.But he didn't know which gene or genes had disappeared
But he didn't know which gene or genes had disappeared. Then, a scientific team led by molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee, then at the University of Utah, found the answer
It was an audacious claim.But in Baltimore, Dr. Vogelstein, a young molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School, believed Dr. Knudson was right, and set out to repeat the Cavenee experiment in cells from other cancers
and set out to repeat the Cavenee experiment in cells from other cancers.Dr. Vogelstein next turned his attention to colon cancer, the second biggest cancer killer in the U.S. after lung cancer

It often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel, which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages.a cascade of genetic damage might be occurring
If both copies of a certain gene were knocked out, benign polyps would develop
If both copies of a second gene were then deleted, the polyps would progress to malignancy

When they found it last winter, Dr. Vogelstein was dubious that the search was over
The deletion Dr. Vogelstein found was in exactly the same spot as p53.But Mr. Levine had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth, whereas the Johns Hopkins scientists were looking for a gene that suppressed growth
But Mr. Levine had said the p53 gene caused cancer by promoting growth, whereas the Johns Hopkins scientists were looking for a gene that suppressed growth

In a report out last week, John Minna and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute say that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing this gene. There also are reports from several labs, as yet unpublished, of missing p53 genes in tissue taken from kidney, brain and skin cancers
people who inherit a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome 3 are especially prone to lung cancer.that the retinoblastoma suppressor gene may also be involved in some lung cancers, as well as several other more common cancers, too
It may even be possible to replace defective genes with healthy versions, though no one has come close to doing that so far

Pierre Peladeau, a Canadian newspaper publisher little-known in the U.S., figures to become a big player in North American printing -- and his ambitions don't end there
The purchase, expected to be completed by year end, will make Quebecor the second-largest commercial printer in North America, behind only R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co., Chicago. The printing customers that Quebecor will gain through Maxwell Graphics include the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade, Time, Sports Illustrated and TV Guide. But the transaction is just Mr. Peladeau's latest step in a larger design: to build Quebecor through acquisitions into an integrated paper, publishing and printing concern with a reach throughout North America
Quebecor still lags in the Quebec circulars market, while Mr. Peladeau's former employees are expanding across Canada

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued New York state for age discrimination against appointed state judges.the commission intervened in a Connecticut state judge's age-bias suit in federal court in New Haven
the mandatory-retirement age hurts the court system because it deprives the state of experienced judges still capable of serving on the bench
Because Justice Rubin turned 76 on May 9, he isn't eligible to be reappointed to the bench at the end of the year
The suit seeks a permanent injunction, back pay for judges who have been forced to retire, reinstatement of retired judges and "other affirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effects of (New York's) unlawful employment practices.The suit's impact on New York may be narrow, however
Most New York judges are elected, and the federal age-discrimination law doesn't apply to elected officials
Under New York law, elected judges must retire at age 70, but then can be appointed to two-year terms until they reach 76

Warner has filed a $1 billion breach of contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against Sony and the Guber-Peters duo, who in turn are countersuing Warner for trying to interfere in Sony's acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. and Guber Peters Entertainment Co. in two transactions valued at over $5 billion
Although settlement talks had been dropped, attorneys for the two sides apparently began talking again yesterday in an attempt to settle the matter before Thursday
they had taken Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters at their word when the producers told them that getting out of the contract would be no problem because of a previous oral agreement
the Sony executives hadn't seen the contract because "it wasn't relevant once Guber and Peters told them Warner would let them terminate it at any time
because "it wasn't relevant once Guber and Peters told them Warner would let them terminate it at any time
who did have access to the contracts but who weren't part of the negotiations between Sony and the duo
Yesterday, in documents filed in connection with that case, Warner accused Sony officials of falsely claiming that they never read the five-year contract requiring the two producers to make movies exclusively for Columbia.Warner executives also filed new sworn affidavits denying claims by Messrs.Guber and Peters that the two sides had an oral agreement that enabled the producers to terminate their contract with Warner should the opportunity to run a major studio come up
denying claims by Messrs.Guber and Peters that the two sides had an oral agreement that enabled the producers to terminate their contract with Warner should the opportunity to run a major studio come up.Sony intends to prove that the oral agreement did in fact exist, and that even the existing written contract doesn't preclude the producers from taking executive posts at another studio

that the oral agreement did in fact exist, and that even the existing written contract doesn't preclude the producers from taking executive posts at another studio
that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters could in theory run Columbia while still fulfilling their contract to produce movies for Warner
Such a dual role would be "impractical and unethical," Warner said, adding, "that concept is as silly as suggesting that the head coach of the Los Angeles Dodgers could simultaneously be general manager of the San Francisco Giants." Warner said it paid the two producers a fixed annual salary of $3 million

Because it's impossible to gauge how long the walkout by 55,000 Machinists rank and file will last, the precise impact on Boeing's sales, earnings, cash flow and short-term investment position couldn't be determined
Despite the progress, Boeing indicated that the work stoppage, now in its 27th day, will have "a serious adverse impact" on the current quarter.The investment community strongly believes that the strike will be settled before there is any lasting effect on either Boeing or its work force

First, the price of natural gas will have to almost double.U.S. gas buyers must also decide whether they want to enter firm contracts for Mackenzie delta gas or develop Alaskan reserves in the Prudhoe Bay area first, a project that has been on hold for more than a decade

since Eastern first filed for Chapter 11 protection March 9, it has consistently promised to pay creditors 100 cents on the dollar
Because the carrier is still pledging to do that, some committee members successfully argued that there's little reason yet to explore a different plan, according to one person familiar with the creditors' position
that the committee has not yet taken any position on Eastern's reorganization plan and that the two sides were still negotiating
Such a change meant the reorganization plan the creditors had agreed on was no longer valid, and the two sides had to begin negotiating again
The move comes.Paribas announced that it was preparing to bid for 66.7% control of Navigation Mixte
Munich-based Allianz's brief explanatory statement said it is acting to protect its own interests as a shareholder of Navigation Mixte.The Allianz statement also reinforced the belief that the takeover battle could be a long one
Allianz's entry reflects the increasing eagerness of West German companies to get involved in what until now were considered internal French affairs.Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank all also have expressed eagerness to expand in France before 1992
Commerzbank had hoped to buy a stake in Credit Lyonnais, until the Socialists returned to government last year and canceled plans to privatize the large French bank
The banks we think would fit into our concept are either government-owned or not for sale, though Deutsche Bank would be able to pay a good price
While Allianz officials weren't willing to comment in any detail on their plans, they said Allianz currently holds between 5% and 10% of Navigation Mixte, an apparent increase from the 5% stake that Navigation Mixte officials had earlier announced
Paris market sources said they believed Allianz was buying yesterday morning, and Navigation Mixte moved up 108 francs ($17.19) to close at 1,908 francs in heavy trading
Allianz currently holds between 5% and 10% of Navigation Mixte, an apparent increase from the 5% stake that Navigation Mixte officials had earlier announced.Allianz also holds a 50% stake in Navigation Mixte's insurance subsidiary, one of France's largest insurance groups
which it bought for about 6.5 billion francs.Paribas launched its bid
Allianz's statement stressed the company's previously announced position that Paribas's offer price is too low.Allianz also suggested, without saying so directly, that it regrets that Paribas isn't bidding for all of Navigation Mixte's shares
if Paribas wins its 66.7%, remaining Navigation Mixte shares will fall in value
which couldn't be sure of selling all their shares if they tendered to Paribas
that it will boost its Navigation Mixte stake as it sees fit over the coming days to protect itself.it has French regulatory officials' approval
Paribas currently intends to offer 1,850 francs a share for Navigation Mixte shares that receive full dividends this year.It is to offer 1,800 francs for shares created on July 1, which receive partial dividends.it would offer to swap three Paribas shares for one Navigation Mixte share
Paribas already holds about 18.7% of Navigation Mixte, and the acquisition of the additional 48% would cost it about 11 billion francs under its current bid
depending on how many holders of Navigation Mixte warrants exchange them for shares before the bid expires

You get a rain at the wrong time and the crop is ruined
They want psyllium prices low for their purchases next year. But there's a catch
Small crops are grown in Pakistan, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium and Brazil, but their quality can't compare to that of Indian psyllium
there are other spots on the globe, and in India, where the seed could be grown.no one has made a serious effort to transplant the crop
Many farmers have decided to plant mustard, fennel, cumin, fenugreek or castor-oil seeds.when next year's psyllium crop is harvested in March, it may be smaller than the 16,000 metric tons of the past few years -- right at the crest of the psyllium boom
when next year's psyllium crop is harvested in March, it may be smaller than the 16,000 metric tons of the past few years -- right at the crest of the psyllium boom
So when next year's psyllium crop is harvested in March, it may be smaller than the 16,000 metric tons of the past few years -- right at the crest of the psyllium boom. And the world could experience its first psyllium shortage
Small businesses say a recent trend is like a dream come true: more-affordable rates for employee-health insurance, initially at least.But then they wake up to a nightmare
Small businesses say a recent trend is like a dream come true: more-affordable rates for employee-health insurance, initially at least.But then they wake up to a nightmare
The reasonable first-year rates can be followed by increases of 60% or more if a covered employee files a major claim
the last increase coming after one of its three workers developed a herniated disk
She said her employer can't afford the rate increases, and she fears she won't find another job with a benefit plan covering her ailment
that small businesses not only can't keep reasonably priced employee-health insurance if claims are filed
but often can't get coverage at all if a worker is termed medically uninsurable
collect premiums from the healthy, dump the sick and let them pay their own bills
As larger companies increasingly self-insure, or use reserves to pay their own workers' medical bills, the insurance industry has turned to the small-employer market that was once a backwater for them
Insurance companies will offer a good rate if no one is sick
Insurance companies will offer a good rate if no one is sick, but it's a roll of the dice
One case of cancer or a high-risk pregnancy with a sick infant, and rates go up 40% to 60%
Small-business people end up paying insurance premiums worth two to three times the cost of one illness.some of its member companies have been denied insurance because individual workers had medical problems that ranged from a mild cardiac condition to psychological counseling after a divorce, hemorrhoids and overweight
some of its member companies have been denied insurance because individual workers had medical problems that ranged from a mild cardiac condition to psychological counseling after a divorce, hemorrhoids and overweight
that stiff competition among its members to insure businesses likely to be good risks during the first year of coverage has aggravated the problem in the small-business market.that rapid rate increases are directly tied to the soaring cost of health care
insurance companies use policies aimed at excluding bad risks because their competitors do
insurance companies use policies aimed at excluding bad risks because their competitors do.But the general practice makes it more difficult to combine small groups of people into larger groups
to combine small groups of people into larger groups, thus spreading the risk over a larger base of premiums
You can't ask one carrier to underwrite on social grounds when that might destroy it in the marketplace
that is strongly opposed by small business who say it would just compound the insurance-cost problems.they support the idea, included in the Kennedy-Waxman bill, of new laws or regulations requiring greater use of community rating, which pegs rates to the use of health care by a community or other large group, and is designed to prevent insurance companies from taking only low-risk small companies as clients
they support the idea, included in the Kennedy-Waxman bill, of new laws or regulations requiring greater use of community rating, which pegs rates to the use of health care by a community or other large group, and is designed to prevent insurance companies from taking only low-risk small companies as clients. But first on the list of priorities is to prohibit state laws requiring the inclusion of specialty items, such as psychiatric care, in basic health plans
Before the state of Wisconsin mandated that mental-health care be covered, there were only 70 mental-health clinics in the state
But first on the list of priorities is to prohibit state laws requiring the inclusion of specialty items, such as psychiatric care, in basic health plans.The insurance-industry association also strongly disagrees with the proposed community rating, which "doesn't save one dollar
The complexities of the insurance problem make the outcome difficult to predict.But to Ms. Allen, the employee whose back problem triggered a huge insurance-rate increase, the issue was simple
What good is having health insurance.it's so expensive that it becomes impossible to keep after only one major claim
Belgium's inflation has been rising steadily for the past year.the latest rise is slower than gains in September and August
Reiss & Co. B.V. of the Netherlands filed a request with the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for permission to buy more than $15 million of Nashua's stock but less than 25%.an affiliate of Unicorp Canada disclosed a stake of less than 5% in Nashua, according to Daniel M. Junius, Nashua's treasurer
Nashua's stock has fluctuated sharply on takeover speculation, rising to a high for the year of $42.875 a share in June from $29.75 in March.But the company has had weak results so far this year, with earnings declining 43% to $13.7 million, or $1.43 a share, on a 4% decline in revenue to $713.5 million through the first nine months of the year
Nashua announced the Reiss request after the market closed
it amended its shareholder rights plan by reducing to 10% from 20% the level of ownership by an outsider that would trigger the issuance to other holders of rights to buy additional shares of Nashua common at half price.the company's board authorized the purchase of up to an additional one million shares

These benefits seem secure despite China's current economic and political troubles.But to Hong Kong, China isn't purely business
But to Hong Kong, China isn't purely business.It is also the sovereign power that, come 1997, will take over this British colony
That promise sounds shaky now that those same leaders have fallen back on Marxist dogma and brute force to crush their nation's democracy movement
Outflows of people and capital from Hong Kong have been growing since the sovereignty issue first arose in the early 1980s
Only four months have passed since the Beijing massacre, and few are prepared to predict its ultimate impact
It may experience an upswing or two in between.But with local investors shaken by China's political and economic turmoil a genuine recovery may not arrive until Hong Kong can prove itself secure under Chinese sovereignty
But a genuine recovery may not arrive until Hong Kong can prove itself secure under Chinese sovereignty
Since the China crisis erupted.the scenario as depicted by the middle-of-the-road group bears a remarkable resemblance to the difficulties Hong Kong currently faces
though respectable for mature industrialized economies, would be unusually slow for Hong Kong
Given Hong Kong's record, Mr. Mushkat's "realists" might have sounded unduly conservative when the interviews took place two years ago
After taking into account the fallout from the China crisis, the government has projected 1989 GDP growth of 5%
a further downward revision may be justified unless the economy stages a more convincing rally
We aren't looking at anything like a doomsday scenario.clearly we're entering a difficult period
The market has grown relatively quiet since the China crisis.But if the Japanese return in force, their financial might could compensate to some extent for local investors' waning commitment

Conversely, strong consumer spending in the U.S. two years ago helped propel the local economy at more than twice its current rate.that global forces will continue to govern Hong Kong's economic rhythm
Once external conditions, such as U.S. demand, swing in the territory's favor.local businessmen will probably overcome their 1997 worries and continue doing business as usual
Indeed, a few economists maintain that global forces will continue to govern Hong Kong's economic rhythm.economic arguments, however solid, won't necessarily impress Hong Kong's 5.7 million people

Many are refugees, having fled China's unending cycles of political repression and poverty since the Communist Party took power in 1949.many of those now planning to leave Hong Kong can't easily be swayed by momentary improvements in the colony's political and economic climate

While Wall Street is retreating from computer-driven program trading, big institutional investors are likely to continue these strategies at full blast

Consequently, abrupt swings in the stock market are not likely to disappear anytime soon.without Wall Street firms trading for their own accounts, the stock-index arbitrage trading opportunities for the big funds may be all the more abundant
Stock-index funds have grown in popularity over the past decade as pension funds and other institutional investors have sought a low-cost way to match the performance of the stock market as a whole
Some stock-index funds are huge.Wells Fargo Investment Advisers managed $25 billion in stock investments tracking the S&P 500 at the end of June, according to Standard & Poor's Corp
Stock-index funds frequently use the futures markets as a hedging tool, but that is a far less aggressive strategy than stock-index arbitrage, in which traders buy and sell big blocks of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from price differences
The 190-point plunge in the stock market Oct. 13 has heightened concerns about volatility.And while signs of an economic slowdown, softer corporate earnings and troubles with takeover financing all have contributed to the stock market's recent weakness, many investors rushed to blame program trading for aggravating market swings

Put these together, and you get programs about rape
Because the show has acquired a sense of place by being filmed on location in Georgia, this episode does a decent job of tracing the social repercussions of the crime
Obviously, it's harder to establish a sense of place in a one-shot TV movie.But tonight's offering, "Settle the Score" (9-11 p.m. EST, on NBC), doesn't even try
This tale of a Chicago policewoman returning home to find the man who raped her 20 years earlier is supposed to be set in the Ozarks.But it's more like an illustration of what Ben Stein describes in his study of social attitudes in the TV industry
that it was partly in response to such attitudes that he is now "a dweller on one of the two islands off the coast of America." But is exile in Hollywood enough
The sole sympathetic character is the prodigal daughter Kate (Jaclyn Smith), and she is tolerable only by virtue of having nothing in common with her kinfolk, a truly benighted pack of Southern Protestants whose grim existence consists mostly of growing peaches and repressing sex

People like Pa do exist, of course.But in Mr. Sohmer's Ozarks, he is but the tip of the patriarchal iceberg
Add the fact that any one of them, including Pa, could be her attacker, and you have a setting that doesn't resemble small-town America, or even Hollywood's nightmare of small-town America, so much as a paranoid feminist dystopia like Margaret Atwood's "The Handmaid's Tale," itself soon to be (you guessed it) a Hollywood movie
Josh makes clumsy passes at Kate when she's seething with anger and fear

By making a break from tradition, Brooks Brothers is seeking a delicate balance.If it promotes fashion too much, the shop risks alienating its old-line customers; by emphasizing "value," it risks watering down its high-minded mystique.

If the case is converted to Chapter 7, what remains of the oil tycoon's once-vast estate would be sold off quickly with most of the proceeds going to the Internal Revenue Service
While admitting such a move would be "devastating" to most creditors, Judge Abramson told a courtroom filled with nearly two dozen attorneys that he was concerned about the toll mounting legal bills will take on Mr. Hunt's shrinking estate and about the fact that, following voting by creditors, none of the reorganization plans appeared to be viable in their present form

When the economy stumbled in the mid-1970s, Akzo NV fell out of bed
as a new downturn in the chemical industry looms, Akzo says it is in far better shape to cope
The fibers business now accounts for only 20% of Akzo's sales.Akzo hasn't yet found a way to achieve another goal: a large presence in the U.S. market for prescription drugs
prices for U.S. pharmaceutical companies remain too high, making it unlikely that Akzo will pursue any major acquisitions in that area.Akzo is considering "alliances" with American drug companies, although he wouldn't elaborate

Although bulk-chemical prices have begun falling in the U.S., they are generally stable in Europe
A decline may come in the first half of 1990.the market doesn't appear on the verge of a severe downturn
In a less glamorous field, Akzo is the world's biggest producer of industrial salt, used as a raw material for the chemical industry as well as for such tasks as melting ice.Akzo also makes products derived from salt, such as chlorine and caustic soda
In the fibers division, profit remains weak, largely because of persistent overcapacity.But Akzo is still slimming down
Although the polyester and rayon markets remain mostly bleak, Akzo has high hopes for some emerging fiber businesses, such carbon fibers and aramid, extremely strong fibers used to reinforce tires and metals and to make such products as bullet-proof vests
Sales growth of 10% a year seems possible.Akzo expects its Twaron business to become profitable in 1990

Akzo also has spent heavily on acquisitions in paints, auto finishes and industrial coatings.In August it completed the $110 million acquisition of Reliance Universal Inc., a U.S. maker of industrial coatings for wood, metals and plastics, from Tyler Corp
Akzo is likely to see strong profit growth from coatings as it realizes cost savings and other benefits from its greater scale
Akzo is the leading seller of birth-control pills in Europe but is still seeking regulatory approvals to enter that market in the U.S. and Japan.Akzo also has small operations in diagnostic tests, generic drugs and veterinary products

We're sorry to see Nigel Lawson's departure from the British government.But his resignation as Chancellor of the Exchequer may be a good thing
But in the end his resignation as Chancellor of the Exchequer may be a good thing.it works as he no doubt intends -- by forcing Prime Minister Thatcher and her counterparts elsewhere to confront the genuine intellectual issues involved
Nigel Lawson's departure from the British government.who also resigned as personal adviser to Mrs. Thatcher
There are the supply-side globalists, who seek to spread the advantages of a common currency through fixed exchange rates.And there are the twin-deficit Keynesians, who predict/advocate devaluations to balance trade flows
He not only slashed marginal tax rates, initially sparking fresh growth in Britain, but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates, indeed joining the European Monetary System
While no doubt agreeing with Mr. Lawson on everything else, Sir Alan is a dyed-in-the-wool monetarist, inclined to defend floating rates to the death
By accounting definitions, this had to produce a sudden trade deficit.As in the U.S., it also produced a sudden burst in the demand for sterling, that is a surge in the sterling monetary aggregates, M-Whatever

But more recently, the pound has been falling with high inflation, which has also seemed almost impervious to the high interest rates Mr. Lawson deployed to stop it. So the British experience presents a genuine puzzle that reaches far beyond the shores of Albion
We had been soliciting opinions on it.Mr. Lawson's resignation
To begin with, we should note that in contrast to the U.S. deficit, Britain has been running largish budget surpluses.We should also add Mr. Lawson's own explanation, as we understand it
We should also add Mr. Lawson's own explanation, as we understand it.We should also concede that in the British experience the monetarist cause regains some of the credibility it lost in the U.S. experience
Perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates, though of course in the event Mr. Lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound, not restrain a strong one
that Mr. Roberts not only chides the Chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling, but also led the chorus saying that Mr. Volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise

The globalists tend to think Mr. Lawson ran onto technical reefs.In fixing rates the choice of initial parities is crucial and perhaps he picked the wrong pound-DM rate

that the retirement of gilts for cash is equivalent to an expansionary open-market operation, indeed, it is the definition of an open market operation to expand the money supply
Alan Reynolds of Polyconomics adds his suspicion that the unrecognized inflationary culprit is the budget surplus.Mr. Reynolds also notes that since British banks have no reserve requirements, high interest rates are less likely to curb inflation than to cause recession

Ogilvy under the fastidious Mr. Roman gained a reputation as occasionally being high-handed in its treatment of clients, of preaching what strategy a client should -- indeed, must -- follow.And some of its top client-service executives, including Mr. Phillips, were promoted to the point they were saddled with administrative duties, with little time to see clients

Still, Unisys said its European business was weak during the quarter, a worrisome sign given that the company has relied on solid results overseas to overcome weakness in the U.S. over the past several quarters. The company also reported slower growth in another important business: systems that use the Unix operating system
That would be a huge problem if it were to continue
That would be a huge problem if it were to continue, because Unisys is betting its business on the assumption that customers want to move away from using operating systems that run on only one manufacturer's equipment and toward systems -- mainly Unix -- that work on almost anyone's machines

Some had predicted earnings of more than $4 a share for this year, up from last year's fully diluted $3.27 a share on earnings of $680.6 million.But the company said Friday that it had losses of $673.3 million through the first nine months, compared with earnings a year earlier of $382.2 million, or $2.22 a share fully diluted, as revenue inched up 1.4% to $7.13 billion from $7.03 billion

If a TV weatherman gets butterflies facing the camera again after a questionable forecast, Donald H. Straszheim surely understands
The chief economist of Merrill Lynch & Co. finds himself in such a position as he buzzes the Midwest on his first road trip since backpedaling on a major prediction
Mr. Straszheim expects he will take some heat, and he's right
Since the last time he traveled this way several months ago, he has recanted a series of bold forecasts of a recession.In February 1988 Merrill Lynch's weekly commentary announced that "the economy is likely to fall into recession in early 1989
The forecasts were widely disseminated, and, in a splashy ad campaign launched in the summer of 1988, Merrill Lynch urged investors to buy bonds
long-term interest rates, then above 9%, could drop to 7% by the end of 1989, so bonds, which benefit from falling rates, would be a good buy
and, in a splashy ad campaign launched in the summer of 1988, Merrill Lynch urged investors to buy bonds.The firm also raised the percentage of bonds in its model portfolio from 40% to 45% and later to 55%
In February 1988, for example, Merrill Lynch's weekly commentary announced that "the economy is likely to fall into recession in early 1989.this September he took a detour if not a U-turn
He softened the talk about a recession.Now he is predicting economic growth of 2.9% this year and 2.1% next year, a more optimistic outlook than the consensus of some four dozen top forecasters surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter
Now, in fact, he is predicting economic growth of 2.9% this year and 2.1% next year, a more optimistic outlook than the consensus of some four dozen top forecasters surveyed by Blue Chip Economic Indicators newsletter. And, just recently, Merrill Lynch cut the recommended bondholdings back to 50%
While such changes might sound minor, they aren't
Now a rocky stock market and weak corporate profits may further threaten the economy.that "it may prove to be the case that we got whipsawed -- that we pulled the recession forecast at just the wrong time
Pestered by bosses, brokers, clients and media people and pushed by their own egos, Wall Street economists are forecasting about everything from broad economic trends to the dinkiest monthly indicator.But the surprisingly durable seven-year economic expansion has made mincemeat of more than one forecast
Some smaller clients don't seem to notice his switch.But with some clients, the talk can heat up a bit
A good half-hour into breakfast at the Palmer House, Mr. O'Brien looks up from his plate after Mr. Straszheim says something about people who believe interest rates are about to nosedive
He doesn't fully succeed, although Mr. Straszheim lists an array of interest-rate scenarios
Dennis O'Brien, the treasurer of Commonwealth Edison Co. in Chicago, adopts a polite approach, waiting for an opportunity to ask about the forecast.In a chilly conference room at Alliance Capital Management in Minneapolis the firm's money managers seem ready to pin Mr. Straszheim to the wall
Do we want to go through this?Or can we ask you why you changed your forecast just when it's about to be right
why you changed your forecast just when it's about to be right
that the new outlook, though still weak, doesn't justify calling a recession right now.We could still have a recession" at some point
We're not running that ad campaign any more," Mr. Straszheim snaps in a rare show of irritation.He adds, "I think it was a fairly decent call.Mr. Straszheim says later, "It's hard to pin this on one factor
His new forecast calls for "a soft landing." And it may be right
You make a forecast, and then you become its prisoner
You make a forecast, and then you become its prisoner
and then you become its prisoner." It is indeed hard to back away from a widely publicized forecast

that in the past it considered seeking control of Milton Roy, of St. Petersburg, Fla., through a merger or tender offer and that it expects to continue to evaluate an acquisition from time to time
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Milton Roy shares leaped $2, to $18.375 each, while Crane sank $1.125, to $21.125 a share
Thermo Electron acquired some 6% of Milton Roy's common stock before throwing in the towel and reducing its stake in early September
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, resigned because Prime Minister Thatcher would not fire her trusted adviser Sir Alan Walters
As there is an effort to "anchor the dollar" either to gold or other currencies, the dispute is worth examining
Until his resignation, Mr. Lawson had been conducting British monetary policy as if the pound were tied to the mark
When Mrs. Thatcher cut the top tax rate to 40%, Mr. Lawson flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark
Mr. Lawson flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark.he reignited the inflation that Mrs. Thatcher, through a long and costly effort, had subdued
If the pound had been tied to the mark, the British would have been unable to cut their exorbitant tax rates
When a country cuts tax rates, it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency
This misguided policy could not prevent a British trade deficit.Mr. Lawson saddled Mrs. Thatcher with a record trade deficit, renewed inflation and high interest rates -- three political failures in a row
after the top tax rate was cut to 40%, the flow abroad of British capital slowed, to 50 billion pounds ($79 billion at the current rate) in 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986
The most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment, instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates
First comes monetary expansion to drive down the currency's value that was pushed up by tax-rate reduction.Then, when the currency falls, interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate
when the currency falls, interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate
This policy is totally mindless, and Sir Alan is correct to point out its deficiencies
Unless the Soviet Union collapses, German reunification is likely to require Germany's neutralization
The implications for Britain, France and the rest of Europe of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge Mr. Lawson's resignation to be unfortunate

The battery of legal documents filed in the past week in connection with the suit provide a peek into the inner workings of this Hollywood dogfight.But they also make it clear that the first thing a judge will have to decide is which, if any, version of events in this morass is fiction, and which fact
that what it really wants is for the producers to fulfill their contractual obligations, but the bitterness of this battle and the accusations flying on both sides make it unlikely that the decade-long relationship between Warner and its two most prolific producers can ever be repaired
Warner, which is in the process of merging with Time Warner Inc., says it is willing to settle the matter out of court.So far Sony hasn't been willing to meet its considerable financial demands
Sony, for its part, could decide that the cost of a Warner settlement or court fight is too high, choosing instead to find someone else to run Columbia
to find someone else to run Columbia, although that too would be costly given the financial arrangement already guaranteed to Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters
In that case, Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters might not suffer financially, but they would be left without their dream job of running a studio and with a considerably scarred relationship with Warner
At the center of any court fight will be the differing interpretations of the written contract between Warner and the two producers, but other murkier issues will play a big role
allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity to run a major studio came up
that Warner was "taking over" the picture, and another producer would be giving all of the orders

that Mr. Semel did convey that information and that Mr. Semel said Mr. Ross was "crazy because of the Time deal.that Mr. Daly "told us that even if Sony did not want us, Warner's relationship with us already was irreparably damaged, that there was no way `to put the egg together, ' and that it would sue Sony for tons of money

The 1989 deficit would have been nearly $10 billion larger had the government been able to spend as much as Congress intended on cleaning up the thrift industry before the year ended on Sept. 30.Because the Resolution Trust Corp. couldn't spend the money fast enough, the savings-and-loan outlays were pushed into fiscal 1990.the 1989 deficit still exceeded the $136 billion target set by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law by $16 billion, a reminder of that law's shortcomings

that foreign companies can acquire Japanese companies -- if the alternative for the Japanese company is extinction
The myths that Japan is not open to concerns from outside has been demolished at a stroke.Sansui is a special case
It expects to post a loss of 6.4 billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about 13.8 billion yen
If you find sound, healthy companies in Japan, they are not for sale
Statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail, because unlike Sansui most of the Japanese companies acquired by foreigners are privately held
Statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail, because unlike Sansui, which is listed on the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges, most of the Japanese companies acquired by foreigners are privately held.But by all accounts foreign companies have bought only a relative handful of Japanese companies this year, while Japanese companies have acquired hundreds of foreign companies

But by all accounts foreign companies have bought only a relative handful of Japanese companies this year.do analysts expect the Sansui deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases
If the strong yen and the high stock prices of Japanese companies weren't deterrents enough, webs of cross-shareholdings between friendly Japanese companies and fiercely independent Japanese corporate attitudes repel most would-be acquirers
when a Japanese company is ready to sell, it has few alternatives remaining
Usually when a Japanese company is ready to sell, it has few alternatives remaining, and the grim demeanors of Sansui's directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company's finest hour
Sansui was once one of Japan's premier makers of expensive, high-quality stereo gear for audiophiles. But in recent years, the market has moved toward less expensive "mini-component" sets, miniaturized amplifiers and receivers and software players that could be stacked on top of each other
As the yen soared in recent years, Sansui's deepening financial problems became a vicious circle
While competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of Japanese factories, Sansui lacked the money to build new plants in Southeast Asia
Our company has not been able to cope very effectively with" changes in the marketplace.even a Japanese company that looks like a dog may turn out to be a good investment for a foreign concern
Attitudes {toward being acquired} are still negative, but they're becoming more positive

The bolstered cellular agreement between BellSouth Corp. and LIN Broadcasting Corp. carries heightened risks and could fail to fend off McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the rival suitor for LIN.the amended pact shows how McCaw's persistence has pushed LIN and BellSouth into a corner, forcing huge debt on the proposed new company
The plan still calls for LIN to combine its cellular telephone properties with BellSouth's and to spin off its broadcasting operations.But under new terms of the agreement LIN holders would receive a special cash dividend of $42 a share, representing a payout of about $2.23 billion, shortly before the proposed merger

But Kenneth Leon, a telecommunications analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co., finds the BellSouth proposal still flawed because the company doesn't have to wait five years to begin buying more LIN shares
BellSouth's revised proposal surprised many industry analysts, especially because of the company's willingness to accept some dilution of future earnings.BellSouth's cellular operations were among the first in the country to become profitable
Analysts were predicting 1990 BellSouth earnings in the range of $3.90 a share, or $1.9 billion, but now those estimates are being scaled back

Market makers in Nasdaq over-the-counter stocks are adding their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading. Their motivation has a strong practical aspect
Program trading is hazardous to their paychecks.Program trading also causes the Nasdaq Composite Index to lose ground against other segments of the stock market
Because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many OTC stocks without sharp price moves, a condition known as illiquidity.Moreover, the price volatility that is amplified by program trading is undercutting efforts to woo individual investors back to an OTC market that sorely misses them
Some of these problems are neither new nor unique to the OTC market.But the big, often tumultuous slide in stock prices this month has turned some of those who have been profiting from the practice against it

When Michael S. Perry took the podium at a recent cosmetics industry event, more than 500 executives packing the room snapped to attention
First Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch packaged-goods giant, spent $2 billion to acquire brands such as Faberge and Elizabeth Arden.Procter & Gamble Co. agreed to buy Noxell Corp. for $1.3 billion
P&G and Unilever bring with them great experience with mundane products like soap and toilet paper, sparking disdain in the glitzy cosmetics trade; but they also bring mammoth marketing clout, sparking fear

Though it is far from certain that companies best known for selling Promise margarine and Tide detergent will succeed in cosmetics, there's little doubt they will shake up the industry
For now, both companies are keeping quiet about their specific plans.But industry watchers expect them to blend the methodical marketing strategies they use for more mundane products with the more intuitive approach typical of cosmetics companies
Likely changes include more emphasis on research, soaring advertising budgets and aggressive pricing.But some cosmetics-industry executives wonder whether techniques honed in packaged goods will translate to the cosmetics business
Cosmetics companies roll out new makeup colors several times a year, and since most products can be easily copied by competitors, they're loath to test them with consumers
since most products can be easily copied by competitors, they're loath to test them with consumers
Just because upscale cosmetics look like packaged goods and smell like packaged goods, it doesn't mean they are packaged goods
Both companies are conservative marketers that rely on extensive market research.P&G rarely rolls out a product nationally before extensive test-marketing
P&G set out to reposition the brand by broadening the product line to include facial cleansers and moisturizers for sensitive skin.It also redesigned Oil of Olay's packaging, stamping the traditional pink boxes with gold lines to create a more opulent look

The presence of Unilever and P&G is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics.The most dramatic changes probably will come in new-product development
As the trend continues, demand for mass-market items that are high quality but only mid-priced -- particularly skin-care products -- is expected to increase

to trust each other when it comes to setting policy on covert activities
If that attitude lasts, it could infuse covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that hasn't been seen in years
Over the past week, the president has agreed to keep the committee informed, usually in advance, of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing.Mr. Bush has pledged as well to respect the 14-year-old executive order barring U.S. agents from assassinating foreign leaders or helping others to do so
Mr. Bush has pledged as well to respect the 14-year-old executive order barring U.S. agents from assassinating foreign leaders or helping others to do so.Despite objections by the CIA, Mr. Bush also has agreed to the establishment of an inspector general at the CIA who would be independent of the CIA director
In return, the Senate panel has dropped efforts to enact legislation requiring the administration to inform it within 48 hours of the launching of any covert activity.It also has removed a ban on CIA use of a contingency fund for covert acts and has agreed to wipe away some tortured and legalistic restrictions on coup planning put in place to ensure that the CIA didn't get back in the assassination game

Mr. Bush even disclosed privately that one Reagan-era deal with Congress required him to notify the odious Panamanian dictator, Manuel Noriega, if the U.S. learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life.The president also hinted he might veto this year's intelligence authorization bill if it is too restrictive

that there had been "a meeting of the minds" with the White House, and that the committee had given Mr. Bush "a clean slate," free of the impediments imposed during the Reagan years
There may be a truce in the long war of nerves between the White House and Congress over how this country conducts secret intelligence operations abroad.There still are some details to be nailed down
Mr. Bush is reserving the right in "rare" instances to keep Congress in the dark, asserting a constitutional prerogative the committee doesn't recognize.And a pending Justice Department interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions that would have to be settled
And a pending Justice Department interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions that would have to be settled.both sides may face political critics

As the air clears from last week's storm of resignations and reshufflings, the government faces a daunting job of rebuilding confidence in its policies
The prime minister and her new chancellor of the exchequer, the untested John Major, need to haul the country through something like a recession to bring down inflation and set the economy moving again.Mrs. Thatcher has to come to terms with European economic integration, beginning with the European Monetary System, which Britain is committed to joining fully someday.Finally, the government has to convince a rattled financial community -- and voters -- it is proceeding coherently toward its goals
It sounds like the work of a decade, but the deadline is late 1991, when Mrs. Thatcher is expected to call another national election
Though Mrs. Thatcher has pulled through other crises, supporters wonder if her steely, autocratic ways are the right formula today
Mr. Lawson quit in exasperation and Sir Alan Walters, the adviser, announced his resignation within an hour
Economists have been anticipating a slump for months.it will be deeper and longer than they had thought
A mild slowdown probably would have run its course by early 1991.the grueling downturn now expected could stretch into 1992
Recovery could be hampered if Britain's major trading partners in Europe cool off as expected in late 1990 and 1991
Though Mrs. Thatcher doesn't need to call an election until June 1992, she would prefer doing so in late 1991
If the economy shows no sign of turning around in about year's time, she will be very vulnerable

Wives May Not Benefit When Men Do Chores
WHEN HUSBANDS take on more housework, they tend to substitute for chores done by the kids rather than by the wife
Not unexpectedly, wives, whether working or non-working, did by far the most -- about 80% of the shopping, laundry and cooking, and about two-thirds of housecleaning, washing dishes, child care and family paper work.Only for yardwork and home maintenance did women do less than half. But the researchers found that while children's household tasks eased the mother's burden appreciably, the husband's helping hand "appears to lighten the children's load almost on a one-for-one basis and to reduce the wife's responsibility only modestly

Answers to a dozen questions in the 1986, 1987, 1988 and 1989 national surveys reveal that men and women in the 18 to 24 age bracket are considerably more liberal on race and gender than were the 18 to 24 year olds in NORC's polling in the early 1970s and early 1980s.66% of the 18 to 24 year olds in the four latest surveys favored an "open housing" law prohibiting homeowners from refusing on racial grounds to sell to prospective buyers.That compares with 58% of the similar age group in the 1980 through 1982 surveys and 55% in the 1972 through 1975 surveys

Censorship isn't a Marxist invention.The czars were no civil libertarians.As late as the 1890s, the Russian government prevented any coverage of famines.It even directed newspapers not to publish anything that might stain the honor of the Turkish sultan's wives.So glasnost is not a value woven with steel threads into the fabric of Russian society

it's far more than the budgetary gimmick it may seem at first glance.Rather, it's a device that could send shock waves through the president's entire relationship with Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress, fundamentally enhance the power of the presidency and transform the way the government does its business

White House aides know it's a step that can't be taken lightly -- and for that reason, the president may back down from launching a test case this year
They prefer to put off the line-item veto until at least next year. Still, Mr. Bush and some other aides are strongly drawn to the idea of trying out a line-item veto
Those bills can't easily be vetoed in their entirety because they often are needed to keep the government operating

Proponents maintain that a president would choose to use a line-item veto more judiciously than that.But there may be another problem with the device: Despite all the political angst it would cause, it mightn't be effective in cutting the deficit
Governors have found that they have to use the device sparingly to maintain political comity.And it isn't even clear that some pork-barrel projects can be hit with a line-item veto because they tend to be listed in informal conference reports accompanying spending bills rather than in the official bills themselves

Auto makers, who began deferring some equipment purchases last spring, can be expected to remain cautious about spending if their sales don't pick up.Machine tool executives are hopeful that recent developments in Eastern Europe will expand markets for U.S.-made machine tools in that region
There is demand for state-of-the-art machine tools in the Soviet Union and in other Eastern European countries as those nations strive to improve the efficiency of their ailing factories as well as the quality of their goods
Machine tool executives are hopeful, however, that recent developments in Eastern Europe will expand markets for U.S.-made machine tools in that region.there's a continuing dispute between machine tool makers and the Defense Department over whether sophisticated U.S. machine tools would increase the Soviet Union's military might
The Commerce Department says go, and the Defense Department says stop

If the output was too great for the domestic market, he said, companies should export
India's overregulated businessmen had to be persuaded, but they have started to think big
Some of the projects being funded by the new issues are the first fruits of Mr. Gandhi's policy, and they require more capital than the smaller industrial units built in the past
Mr. Gandhi has called general elections for November, and many businessmen fear that he and his Congress (I) Party will lose
Some companies are raising money in anticipation of a government less predictable than Mr. Gandhi's, and possibly more restrictive.that some of the money raised in the current spate of issues will be used as campaign donations before the elections

Texas Instruments Inc., once a pioneer in portable computer technology, today will make a bid to reassert itself in that business by unveiling three small personal computers.The introductions also mark Texas Instruments' plunge back into a technology it has all but ignored for the past several years
Although the Dallas-based computer giant introduced the first portable data terminal in 1971 -- a 38-pound monster -- and the world's first microprocessor-based portable in 1976, the only portable machines it has introduced since the first part of the decade have been "dumb" terminals with limited on-board processing ability

Insurers may see claims resulting from the San Francisco earthquake totaling nearly $1 billion -- far less than the claims they face from Hurricane Hugo -- but the recent spate of catastrophes should jolt property insurance rates in coming months
That's because only about 30% of California homes and businesses had earthquake insurance to cover the losses
The estimated earthquake losses are low compared with the $4 billion in claims that insurers face from Hurricane Hugo.that the combination of the Bay area earthquake, Hugo and last week's explosion at the Phillips Petroleum Co. 's refinery in Pasadena, Texas, will cause property insurance and reinsurance rates to jump
Insurers buy this insurance protection for themselves by giving up a portion of the premiums they collect on a policy to another firm -- a reinsurance company, which accepts a portion of any losses resulting from this policy
After Hugo hit, many insurers exhausted their reinsurance coverage
companies scrambled to replace reinsurance coverages again and Lloyd's syndicates turned to the London market excess lines for protection of their own
insurers who took big losses this fall and had purchased little reinsurance in recent years will be asked to pay some pretty hefty rates if they want to buy reinsurance for 1990
insurers who took big losses this fall and had purchased little reinsurance in recent years will be asked to pay some pretty hefty rates if they want to buy reinsurance for 1990.However, companies with few catastrophe losses this year and already big buyers of reinsurance are likely to see their rates remain flat, or perhaps even decline slightly
Insurers typically retain a small percentage of the risks they underwrite and pass on the rest of the losses.some large insurers, such as State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., don't purchase reinsurance, but fund their own program
A few years ago, State Farm, the nation's largest home insurer, stopped buying reinsurance because no one carrier could provide all the coverage that it needed and the company found it cheaper to self-reinsure
because no one carrier could provide all the coverage that it needed and the company found it cheaper to self-reinsure
Since few insurers have announced what amount of losses they expect to see from the earthquake, it's impossible to get a clear picture of the quake's impact on fourth-quarter earnings
Transamerica expects an after-tax charge of less than $3 million against fourth-quarter net; Hartford Insurance Group, a unit of ITT Corp., expects a $15 million or 10 cents after-tax charge; and Fireman's Fund Corp. expects a charge of no more than $50 million before taxes and after using its reinsurance

Lawmakers haven't publicly raised the possibility of renewing military aid to the Contras, and President Bush parried the question at a news conference here Saturday
if there's an all-out military offensive, that's going to change the equation 180 degrees
Lawmakers haven't publicly raised the possibility of renewing military aid to the Contras, and President Bush parried the question at a news conference here Saturday, saying only that "if there's an all-out military offensive, that's going to change the equation 180 degrees." But Mr. Ortega's threat over the weekend to end a 19-month cease-fire with the rebels seeking to topple him, effectively elevated the Contras as a policy priority just as they were slipping from the agendas of their most ardent supporters
But Mr. Ortega's threat over the weekend to end a 19-month cease-fire with the rebels seeking to topple him, effectively elevated the Contras as a policy priority just as they were slipping from the agendas of their most ardent supporters
that he would continue to abide by the cease-fire if the U.S. ends its financial support for the Contras
it came as Nicaragua is under special international scrutiny in anticipation of its planned February elections
Outside observers are gathering in Nicaragua to monitor the registration and treatment of opposition candidates.And important U.S. lawmakers must decide at the end of November if the Contras are to receive the rest of the $49 million in so-called humanitarian assistance under a bipartisan agreement reached with the Bush administration in March
While few lawmakers anticipated that the humanitarian aid would be cut off next month, Mr. Ortega's threat practically guarantees that the humanitarian aid will be continued
Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) said yesterday on "Meet the Press": "I would hope after his {Mr.Ortega's} act yesterday or the day before, we'd have unanimous support for quick action on remaining humanitarian aid." Sen. Dole also said he hoped for unanimous support for a resolution he plans to offer tomorrow denouncing the Nicaraguan leader
While renewing military aid had been considered out of the question, rejected by Congress and de-emphasized by the Bush administration, Mr. Ortega's statement provides Contra supporters with the opportunity to press the administration on the issue
if the {February} election is voided by the Sandinistas . . . they should call for military aid
that congressional Democrats intend to honor the March agreement to give non-lethal support to the Contras through the February elections.that the agreement requires that the Contras not initiate any military action
Mr. Ortega's threat to breach the cease-fire comes as U.S. officials were acknowledging that the Contras have at times violated it themselves
while maintaining that the Sandinistas had also broken the cease-fire, acknowledged: "It's never very clear who starts what
that the Contras have at times violated it themselves.that the Sandinistas had also broken the cease-fire
that the U.S. has cut off aid to some rebel units when it was determined that those units broke the cease-fire
In addition to undermining arguments in favor of ending Contra aid, Mr. Ortega's remarks also played to the suspicions of some U.S. officials and conservatives outside the government that he is searching for ways to manipulate or void the February elections
that he isn't responding to the military attacks so much as he is searching for ways to strengthen his hand prior to the elections

that cuts spending for new installations by 16% while revamping the Pentagon budget to move more than $450 million from foreign bases to home-state projects
The fiscal 1990 measure builds on a pattern set earlier this year by House and Senate defense authorizing committees.overseas spending is most vulnerable
and -- at a time of retrenchment for the military and concern about the U.S.'s standing in the world economy -- overseas spending is most vulnerable.Total Pentagon requests for installations in West Germany, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom and the Philippines are cut by almost two-thirds

of being transferred to faster-spending areas after the budget scorekeeping is completed
Much of the excess spending will be pushed into fiscal 1991, and in some cases is temporarily parked in slow-spending accounts in anticipation of being transferred to faster-spending areas after the budget scorekeeping is completed.a House-Senate conference ostensibly increased the National Aeronautics and Space Administration budget for construction of facilities to nearly $592 million, or more than $200 million above what either chamber had previously approved.Part of the increase would provide $90 million toward ensuring construction of a costly solid rocket-motor facility in Mr. Whitten's Mississippi.But as much as $177 million, or nearly 30% of the account, is marked for potential transfers to research, management and flight accounts that are spent out at a faster clip

Now, the nationwide average yield on a six-month CD is just under 8%, and 8.5% is about the best around
With $150 billion of CDs maturing this month, a lot of people have been scouring the financial landscape for just such an investment.investors looking for alternatives aren't finding it easy

If you're looking for a significantly higher yield with the same level of risk as a CD, you're not going to find it.There are some alternatives that income-oriented investors should consider
Short-term municipal bonds, bond funds and tax-deferred annuities are some of the choices.investors may want to look at securities that reduce the risk that CD holders are confronting right now, of having to reinvest the proceeds of maturing short-term certificates at lower rates
That's because municipal-bond interest is exempt from federal income tax -- and from state and local taxes too, for in-state investors
These securities get top credit ratings because the issuers have put aside U.S. bonds that will be sold to pay off holders when the municipals are retired

Bond resale prices, and thus fund share prices, move in the opposite direction from rates.The price movements get bigger as the maturity of the securities lengthens. Consider two bond funds from Vanguard Group of Investment Cos. that were both yielding 8.6% on a recent day.The Short Term Bond Fund, with an average maturity of 2 1/2 years, would deliver a total return for one year of about 10.6% if rates drop one percentage point and a one-year return of about 6.6% if rates rise by the same amount.But, in the same circumstances, the returns would be a more extreme 14.6% and 2.6% for the Vanguard Bond Market Fund, with its 12 1/2-year average maturity

Still, today's highest-yielding money funds may beat CDs over the next year even if rates fall

Our five-year plan contains three accounting devices -- negative money, an above guidance management reserve and optimistic inflation estimates -- which understate the spending the Pentagon has committed itself to by almost $100 billion.The 1990 plan also assumes inflation will decline to 1.7% by 1994
What happens if these increases do not materialize
This scenario has been the rough position of the U.S. Senate since 1985, and it reduces the baseline by $106 billion between 1990 and 1994
Scenario 1, known as the "Constant Dollar Freeze," reimburses the Pentagon for inflation only -- it slopes upward at 4% per year.This scenario has been the rough position of the U.S. Senate since 1985, and it reduces the baseline by $106 billion between 1990 and 1994. Scenario 3, the "Current Dollar Freeze," has been the approximate position of the House of Representatives for about four years.It freezes the budget at its current level, and forces the Pentagon to eat the effects of inflation until 1994.This reduces the baseline by $229 billion. Scenario 2 extends the recent compromises between the House and the Senate; it splits the difference between Scenarios 1 and 3, by increasing the budget at 2% per year.It reduces the baseline by $169 billion.Scenario 4 reduces the budget by 2% per year for the next five years -- a total reduction of $287 billion
If, for example, they choose to keep the B-2 Stealth bomber, they would have to sacrifice more and more other programs -- such as carrier battlegroups or army divisions -- as they moved toward lower budget levels

This argument plays well in the atmosphere of gaming and mistrust permeating the Pentagon and Congress, and unfortunately, there is some truth to it.But in the end, it must be rejected for logical as well as moral reasons

that the Pentagon should deliberately exaggerate its needs in the national interest.that it is justified in committing a crime -- lying to Congress -- because it is morally superior

Rather, there increasingly is a group of international brokerage and trading firms that operate in most European financial centers -- including European giants such as Barclays Bank PLC and Deutsche Bank, as well as Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. of the U.S. and Japan's Nomura Securities Co
These firms are calling the shots when it comes to deciding in which market to transact a trade

About a year ago, it ended an on-again, off-again internal production war that had put prices on a roller coaster and pitched oil towns from Houston to Caracas into recession.Saudi Arabia, OPEC's kingpin, abandoned a policy of flooding the market to punish quota-cheaters.About the same time, the Iran-Iraq war, which was roiling oil markets, ended.global petroleum demand has been climbing
Consumers offer security of markets, while OPEC provides security of supply
At its November meeting, it will try to revise its quotas to satisfy Persian Gulf members that can produce far more oil than their allotments.if they walk out without any effort to resolve their problem, production could increase to 23 million or 24 million barrels a day, making for a very troublesome first quarter

Prices have averaged more than $2 a barrel higher than that -- not a windfall, but at least a pleasant bonus for them.So, according to a Dun & Bradstreet Corp. survey, companies that had been refusing to spend even their very conservative budgets may loosen up before year end

Contrary to what might be expected based on the headline on John R. Dorfman's recent Money Matters article ("Pros Hit Theorists Right Where It Hurts" Oct. 3), I was able to stand proudly before my undergraduate finance students and proclaim that the findings of your yearlong experiment on stock picking is completely consistent with what they have been taught in the classroom.I do not find the fact that your group of pros' monthly selections of four stocks outperforms the market in general to be inconsistent with market efficiency
who invested $100,000 a year ago in the first four stocks selected by your pros and then sold those one month later
that an investor who invested $100,000 a year ago in the first four stocks selected by your pros and then sold those one month later, purchasing the four new pro picks, and repeated this process for the year would have accumulated $166,537, excluding account dividends, taxes and commissions.an investor holding the Dow Jones portfolio over the year would have accumulated only $127,446
Accepted theories state that investors require higher returns on riskier investments.Thus, rather than seeing the excess returns to the pro-selected portfolio as being abnormal, I see those returns as simply compensations for taking on added risk
If you asked me to select a stock with the highest expected return, I would select a stock with the greatest amount of undiversifiable risk
Your hypothetical investor is simply being compensated for taking on this added risk.your hypothetical investor has forsaken the gains to be had in reducing risk by diversifying his portfolio
Mr. Dorfman provides confirming evidence of this phenomenon when he reports that your staff of dart throwers would have accumulated only $112,383 by randomly selecting four new stocks to be held in a portfolio each month
that the stocks recommended by your pros tend to be substantially riskier than a diversified portfolio.your pickers' recommendations for the coming month are, on average, 22.5% riskier than holding the market portfolio according to Value Line's Beta estimates

Why do you maintain the House-passed capital-gains plan is a "temporary" reduction when it is not
Depending on the size of the gain and the rate of inflation, indexation can mean a lower tax payment than using the 19.6% rate without indexation.But in any event tax "payments" on capital gains will be lower with indexation than under current law, even though the tax "rate" is the same under both systems
and this is the important point -- tax "payments" on capital gains will be lower with indexation than under current law, even though the tax "rate" is the same under both systems
But in any event tax "payments" on capital gains will be lower with indexation than under current law.the tax "rate" is the same under both systems
The reduction eases the burden on portfolio changes and frees capital to seek more productive or more appropriate uses.But what is really significant is the indexation of capital gains after 1991
A large part of the long-term appreciation of assets reflects inflation, and the taxation of inflation-created capital gains is confiscation
that people ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest
The Financial Accounting Standards Board said it will soon issue a rule requiring disclosure about the financial risk of certain financial instruments. But the chief rule-making body for accountants backed off one part of its original proposal made earlier this year that would have required a breakdown of certain balance-sheet items related to off-balance sheet instruments
The balance-sheet detail was opposed by many banks and thrifts that felt the cost of supplying such data wasn't worth the value of the disclosures. Under the initial proposal banks would have been required to disclose that portion of allowances for loan losses that reflects specific letters of credit for which customers had defaulted
that would occur if the outside party involved in the instrument failed to perform
that a final rule will be issued before year end.that the initial effective date of the earlier proposal had been delayed by six months

although it took all five genes to produce the toxin, only one was responsible for the toxin's virulence
Ordinarily in genetic engineering each of these genes, minus the one that caused the virulence, would have been transferred to another bacterium, called E. coli, which would then produce a nonvirulent version of the toxin
The researchers said they did this, but the toxin didn't induce immunity to whooping cough

At a time when foreign banks are pouring vast resources and personnel into West Germany's financial center, the opening of a three-man office on a Frankfurt side street shouldn't attract much attention. Unless, of course, it happens to be run by the Rothschilds
Like other foreign banks establishing a presence here, the family describes its move as a calculated decision to set up a financial services outlet in Europe's largest economy ahead of the integration of European Community markets after 1992.Yet the Rothschilds don't deny an emotional element to the decision
In 1796, Mayer Amschel Rothschild founded Bankhaus M.A. Rothschild & Sons and later sent his four sons to London, Paris, Vienna and Naples to begin the bank's expansion during the early 19th century
The original bank in Frankfurt closed in 1901 after the death of Wilhelm Carl von Rothschild, and the family's banking activities focused on London and Paris
that by the end of the 19th century, Berlin had replaced Frankfurt as Germany's financial center.Yet the chief reason for the closure was rooted in a family tradition that wouldn't allow a bank to bear the Rothschild name without a Rothschild in its management
At the time we had only daughters.we had to close the bank
Although its palatial residence was destroyed by bombs during World War II, the Rothschilds' place in Frankfurt's history is still recalled by the city park and a street bearing the Rothschild name

GM sought U.S. antitrust clearance last week to purchase more than $15 million worth of Jaguar shares according to GM officials here and at the company's Detroit headquarters.The No. 1 U.S. auto maker then wrote Jaguar that it intends "to go to that 15%" level once it wins the U.S. clearance to go beyond $15 million

Ford is willing to bid for 100% of Jaguar's shares if both the government and Jaguar shareholders agree to relax the anti-takeover barrier prematurely
Ford might succeed because many shareholders are speculators keen for a full bid or institutional investors unhappy over Jaguar management's handling of its current financial difficulties

As the Soviet Union grapples with its worsening economy, leading reformers have drawn up a blueprint for change designed to push the nation much closer to a free-market system
They lay out a clear timetable and methodology for liberalizing the system of setting prices, breaking up huge industrial monopolies and putting unprofitable state-owned companies out of business.They also address such taboo subjects as the likelihood of unemployment and high inflation, and recommend ways to soften the social consequences
While many solutions to the nation's economic troubles are being discussed, the blueprint is attracting widespread attention here because of its comprehensiveness and presumed high-level authorship
Although it was published unsigned in the latest edition of the weekly Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta.the article was written by Leonid Abalkin and a small group of colleagues
The economic ideas in the document are much bolder than current policies.the proposed overhaul of prices -- an extremely sensitive political topic -- is far more precise than the vague plans announced by Mr. Gorbachev in 1987 and later dropped

who stand to lose out if they are implemented
As policy-makers draw up proposals for the next five-year plan.the blueprint represents a powerful first shot in what is likely to be a fierce battle over economic reform
and concede that "quick and easy paths to success simply don't exist." Instead, they map out a strategy in several phases from now until 1995
The entire system of centrally set prices would be overhauled, and free-market prices introduced for most wholesale trade and some retail trade
Consumers would still be able to buy some food and household goods at subsidized prices, but luxury and imported items, including food, would be sold at market prices
The blueprint is at its vaguest when referring to the fate of the two powerful economic institutions that seem likely to oppose such sweeping plans: the State Planning Committee, known as Gosplan, and the State Committee for Material Supply, or Gossnab

Alfred Sikes, the new FCC chairman, championed deregulation of AT&T at his last job as head of a Commerce Department telecommunications agency.But it has been an open question whether Mr. Sikes, an extraordinarily cautious man, would continue pushing deregulation at the FCC in the face of what is likely to be great political pressure

The surprise resignation yesterday of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson sent sterling into a tailspin against the dollar by creating uncertainties about the direction of the British economy.

The U.S. unit also firmed against other currencies on the back of sterling's tumble, as market participants switched out of pounds
The surprise resignation yesterday of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson sent sterling into a tailspin against the dollar.The pound also dropped precipitously against the mark
Mr. Lawson's resignation shocked many analysts, despite the recent recurring speculation of a rift between the chancellor and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Indeed, only hours earlier, Mrs. Thatcher had called Mr. Lawson's economic policies "sound" and said she has "always supported" him
that Mr. Lawson's replacement, John Major, the British foreign minister, will take time to establish his credibility and, in the meantime, sterling could trend downward in volatile trade
that Mr. Lawson's replacement, John Major, the British foreign minister, will take time to establish his credibility and sterling could trend downward in volatile trade
Mr. Foley of Lloyds noted that Mr. Lawson's replacement, John Major, the British foreign minister, will take time to establish his credibility and, in the meantime, sterling could trend downward in volatile trade. But Mr. Foley predicted few economic policy changes ahead, commenting that Mr. Major shares "a very similar view of the world" with Mr. Lawson
But Mr. Foley predicted few economic policy changes ahead, commenting that Mr. Major shares "a very similar view of the world" with Mr. Lawson. Bob Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank in New York, also noted that the pound's sharp decline is pegged more to uncertainty in the market than a vision of altered United Kingdom economic policies
Unless Mr. Lawson's resignation leads to a change in British interest-rate policy or posturing toward full inclusion in the European Monetary System's exchange-rate mechanism, Mr. Lawson's withdrawal will have little long-term impact on exchange rates

George Bush disclosed the policy last week by reading it to GOP senators, perhaps as a way of shifting blame for the Panama fiasco to Congress.But the broader truth is more complicated -- and dismaying

that we can't abolish these oversight committees because we've seen too many abuses of executive power

the first ship probably will be delivered close to schedule, but that Carnival may have to pay up to 25% more to get the second and third ships
All the ships are covered by loan guarantees from a state export financing agency.it's not clear whether they will actually be built
if the government makes good a threat to withdraw its guarantee commitments, shippers will counter with a hail of lawsuits
State loan guarantees are rarely a source of controversy.However, some bankers cited possible parallels between the Waertsilae Marine case and the collapse of Norway's state-owned Kongsberg Vappenfabrikk AS two years ago
In that case, international banks and investors incurred big losses because they incorrectly believed the company's debt carried implicit state guarantees
Doubts about the quality of state credit guarantees could reduce the competitive strength of Finnish companies in world markets where financing often is the key to winning orders.state-owned Finnish companies lacking formal state guarantees could face greater difficulty raising funds in international financial markets
Under the rescue plan, Waertsilae sold 51% of its stake to a group of banks and pension funds.The government guaranteed financing to complete the order backlog and took control of the board
to combine Waertsilae Marine with two other struggling firms, and thus ensure Finland's survival as a shipbuilding nation
but was thwarted when the parent Waertsilae concern pulled out at the last minute
After the restructuring of Waertsilae Marine and bolstered by state loan guarantees, two big bank creditors, Union Bank of Finland and state-controlled Postipankki, resumed lending the shipyard working capital.But the bankers got cold feet recently as government officials complained they had been misled about the shipyard's actual financial condition
But the bankers got cold feet recently as government officials complained they had been misled about the shipyard's actual financial condition, and hinted the credit guarantees might be withdrawn
it was the state's refusal to explicitly reaffirm the credit guarantees that led Union Bank and Postipankki to halt lending to Waertsilae Marine.Then, in a boardroom showdown, state-appointed directors voted to file for bankruptcy, apparently under instructions from Finland's Industry Minister Ilkka Suominen
Mr. Suominen had grown increasingly worried about the state's potential financial exposure as Waertsilae Marine's losses ballooned to more than double the figure estimated in August
The talks may drag on for weeks before any concrete result is announced
One solution would be to sell the shipyard to an outsider.But there appear to be few, if any, suitors

Intel Corp. 's most powerful computer chip has flaws that could delay several computer makers' marketing efforts, but the "bugs" aren't expected to hurt Intel and most computer makers

that discretionary power could have an impact on the markets if rumors were to circulate about when the exchanges might be closed
Mr. Breeden contended that discretionary power could have an impact on the markets if rumors were to circulate about when the exchanges might be closed.He added that the president already has the power to close the markets in an emergency. But Mr. Brady argued that the SEC is closer to the markets and in a better position to understand when the exchanges are under such stress that they should be closed
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said that Congress should grant the Securities and Exchange Commission the power to close the stock markets in periods of crisis.Mr. Brady said he asked the Working Group on Financial Markets to determine whether futures margins are too low

I do not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time.Mr. Brady endorsed the market-revision bill that both houses of Congress will try to push through this session
That bill would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial positions of their holding companies, mandate large traders' reporting of program or block trades, and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets. The bill also would give the SEC the power to close the markets, a discretion that former SEC Chairman David Ruder wanted but Mr. Breeden doesn't
The proposed legislation has a laudable goal: to assure the integrity of the U.S. futures markets.the proposal contains many provisions that could destroy important parts of the system it sets out to preserve
The complex bill covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and would profoundly change the way the industry is regulated.The bill also elevates even minor rule infractions to felonies and provides for recovery of punitive damages in civil lawsuits and arbitration cases without any showing of willful misconduct
Many aspects of the bill are salutary, providing appropriate public safeguards that can and should be instituted throughout the industry.Indeed, some of the bill's requirements, including broad representation on the exchanges' boards of directors and strong measures to prevent conflicts of interest, already have been put in place by the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange and other futures exchanges

On the hungry streets of Naguib Mahfouz's Cairo, life is nasty, brutish and wickedly entertaining.Mr. Mahfouz's Cairo also has Sufi sheiks and saintly wives who look to God, not crime, for their salvation
Mr. Mahfouz's Cairo also has Sufi sheiks and saintly wives who look to God, not crime, for their salvation.But it is his portrait of Cairo low-life -- of charlatans and opium addicts, of streets filled with "dust, vegetable litter, and animal dung" -- that made his reputation, and won him the Nobel Prize in 1988
Three novels, "The Beginning and the End" (412 pages, $19.95), "The Thief and the Dogs" (158 pages, $16.95), and "Wedding Song" (174 pages, $16.95), recently published by Doubleday offer an uneven sample of the 77-year-old Mr. Mahfouz's talent.But they do show the range of a restless intellect whose 30-odd novels span five decades and include work of social realism, protest and allegory
But they do show the range of a restless intellect whose 30-odd novels span five decades and include work of social realism, protest and allegory.They also chart the evolution of a city that has grown tenfold in the author's lifetime, from a colonial outpost of fez-wearing pashas to a Third World slum choking on its own refuse
The Beginning and the End," easily the best of the three, belongs to Mr. Mahfouz's "realistic" period and it is the one for which he is most renowned
His daughter turns to dressmaking, then to peddling herself for a few piasters
One son sacrifices his own career so that his avaricious brother can succeed
One son sacrifices his own career so that his avaricious brother can succeed, while another helps support the family with money siphoned from crime
A minor bureaucrat dies suddenly, dooming his family to poverty and eventual disgrace.The real tragedy, though, lies not in the family's circumstances but in its concern for appearances
Mourning for the father is overshadowed by the shame of burying him in a pauper's grave.The family moves to another house at night to conceal shabby belongings from neighbors.And the successful son wishes his embarrassing siblings dead
As a critique of middle-class mores, the story is heavy-handed.But its unsentimental sketches of Cairo life are vintage Mahfouz
We see, smell and hear slums filled with "the echoes of hawkers advertising their wares interspersed with abusive language, rattling coughs and the sound of people gathering spittle in their throats and spewing into the street." And we meet engaging crooks, such as Hassan "the Head," famed for his head-butting fights, his whoring and his hashish
Hassan comes to a bad end, but so does almost everyone else in the book
If the setting is exotic, the prose is closer to Balzac's "Pere Goriot" than it is to "Arabian Nights
Mr. Mahfouz began writing when there was no novelistic tradition in Arabic
Mr. Mahfouz began writing when there was no novelistic tradition in Arabic, and he modeled his work on Western classics
unlike a writer such as Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who has a distinctive Latin voice, Mr. Mahfouz's style offers little that can be labeled "Egyptian." But the familiarity of his style also makes his work accessible, as the streets of Cairo come alive for the Western reader as vividly as Dickens's London or Dostoevski's St. Petersburg
In one sense, this limits him.But the familiarity of his style also makes his work accessible

I am the hope and the dream, the redemption of cowards," he says in one of many interior monologues.Later, he recalls the words of his Marxist mentor: "The people! Theft! The holy fire
By 1961, Mr. Mahfouz's idealism had vanished or become twisted, as it has in Said.Cairo's spirited squalor also has gone gray
While the theme is compelling, the plot and characters are not

The story of a playwright's stage debut unfolds in first-person monologues, in the manner of Faulkner's "The Sound and the Fury." But the device obscures more than it illuminates
Buried in the work is a meditation on the morality of art, and on the struggle for integrity in an unfair world.But again, the themes get tangled in Mr. Mahfouz's elliptical storytelling
The clutter of the 1940s remains, but its color has drained away, and the will to overcome has been defeated

As Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has opened up the country to foreign trade, the discrepancy has become ever greater
They use dollars to buy Western items such as video recorders and personal computers and then sell them at a huge mark-up
With more than 300 billion rubles in savings accounts and little to spend them on, Soviet consumers grumble at the exorbitant black-market prices for such goods -- but they buy them anyway
to iron out exchange-rate discrepancies as Moscow moves toward making the ruble convertible -- a goal that Soviet bankers and economists say is still far away
Rumors of an impending devaluation have been circulating in Moscow for weeks, but the size of the cut took many Western bankers by surprise

But the amounts they exchange may be limited; most Soviet hotels demand payment in hard currency from Western visitors
Unless other rules are changed, the devaluation could cause difficulties for the people it is primarily meant to help: Soviets who travel abroad
Over the past three years, thousands of people here have made use of looser travel restrictions to get their first taste of life abroad. But under current rules, they are allowed to change just 200 rubles into dollars and other currencies for each trip
If it isn't, the black market for dollars probably will continue to thrive

This year is the 75th anniversary of the Federal Reserve System.it's time to take a fresh look at the nation's central bank
After 75 years there may be a few things that are worth reexamining. The regional Federal Reserve Bank setup may be out of date
In earlier years it may have seemed reasonable to give Richmond, Va., a bank and allow Los Angeles only a branch of the San Francisco bank, but times have changed
and some members of Congress think it's time to take a fresh look at the nation's central bank.Some of the would-be reformers want to restore an arrangement we once had -- or, at least, part of it
In the beginning, the treasury secretary and the comptroller of the currency were both ex officio members of the Federal Reserve Board.But in 1935, when Congress was trying to find someone or something to blame for the Great Depression, it decided to drop both the secretary and the comptroller from the board
when he was on the board he felt that he had a great deal of power
that he had a great deal of power and, somehow that was a good thing
that the change would accomplish much but at least Congress, as in 1935, would be doing something
Nicholas Brady, the incumbent treasury secretary, is of course aware of the proposal, and he doesn't like it much
That may have pleased the secretary, but H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist of the investment firm of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co., suggests that Mr. Brady may figure he already has all the power he needs
Like most treasury secretaries, Mr. Brady takes a keen interest in monetary matters, of course.He was taking an especially keen interest in board matters even before he went to the treasury
He was, in fact, taking an especially keen interest in board matters.he went to the treasury
what went wrong and what should be done about it
This recommendation might have encouraged a turf-hungry bureaucrat to try to expand his power, but so far Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan hasn't made a pitch for the job
The Fed has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in 1987 and again in 1989 it appears to have handled them well
he thought government agencies in the latest market drop were better prepared to coordinate their actions, but he has left no doubt that he still likes the ideas the commission advanced nearly two years ago
that he still likes the ideas the commission advanced nearly two years ago. In recent weeks Mr. Brady has joined other administration officials in trying to urge the Fed toward lower interest rates
the Fed may be slightly more interested in curbing inflation than the administration is, while the administration may put slightly more emphasis on spurring economic growth
The inflation-growth argument is an old one, but Mr. Brady, on the board or off, is surely trying to influence Fed policy
The treasury can do something on its own, but to have any hope of success it needs help from the Fed
The Fed has been intervening in foreign currency markets, all right, but through August, at least, it appeared to be "sterilizing" the intervention
but through August, at least, it appeared to be "sterilizing" the intervention.it was offsetting purchases of marks and yen by buying dollars in the domestic money market
When traders see the Fed is in the exchange market it may make them tread a little carefully, for fear of what the central bank may do
Now, sterilized intervention may have some effect.that sterilized intervention has little or no lasting impact on currency values
After August the Fed may have stopped sterilizing, but it's hard to see much impact on the dollar
The Fed has let interest rates slip slightly, but whether the main reason was dollar intervention, the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment, or the Friday 13 market drop, only Mr. Greenspan and his associates know
Trying to manage exchange rates to some desired level would mean diverting monetary and fiscal policies from their customary roles and thereby risking excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation

Janet Malcolm, a professional writer on psychiatric matters, wrote a series of articles for the New Yorker, later published in book form by Knopf under the title "In the Freud Archives
Janet Malcolm, a professional writer on psychiatric matters, wrote a series of articles for the New Yorker, later published in book form by Knopf under the title "In the Freud Archives.Mr. Masson then brought a libel suit against Ms. Malcolm, the New Yorker and Knopf
As a public figure, Mr. Masson had to prove malice and, as proof of malice, Mr. Masson contended that defamatory quotations ascribed to him by Ms. Malcolm were in fact fabricated
The quotes could not be found on the tapes, and the two judges who decided the case for Ms. Malcolm and her publishers conceded that, for the purpose of their decision, "we assume the quotations were deliberately altered
For all historians and most journalists, this admission would have been sufficient to condemn the Malcolm articles.But Judge Arthur Alarcon, joined by Judge Cynthia Holcomb Hall, took the astonishing position that it is perfectly OK to fabricate quotations so long as a judge finds that the fabrications do not alter substantive content or are rational interpretations of ambiguous remarks
when a writer uses quotation marks in reporting what someone has said, the reader assumes that these are the speaker's precise words or at least his words purged of "uh" and "you know" and grammatical error
While judges have an obligation under the First Amendment to safeguard freedom of the press, "the right to deliberately alter quotations is not, in my view, a concomitant of a free press
to deliberately alter quotations.Ms. Malcolm wrote that Mr. Masson described himself as "the greatest analyst who ever lived." No such statement appears on the tapes
The majority cited Mr. Masson's remark "It's me alone . . . against the rest of the analytic world" as warrant for the Malcolm fabrication.But, as Judge Kozinski noted, the context shows that Mr. Masson's "me alone" remark referred not to his alleged pre-eminence in his profession but to the fact that his position on a particular issue was not shared by anyone else
that the phrase was a rational interpretation of Mr. Masson's description of himself as a "private asset but a public liability" to Anna Freud and that in any case it was not defamatory
Mr. Masson emerges "as a grandiose egotist . . . and, in the end, a self-destructive fool.But it is not Janet Malcolm who calls him such
Masson has lost his case, but the defendants, and the profession to which they belong, have lost far more

Allow the EPA to permit the continued use of pesticides that exceed its negligible risk standard if the benefits of doing so outweigh the cost

So why does Renaissance's computer like stocks with the Dow at 2653.28.it didn't with the Dow at 2200
Three-month T-bill yields have fallen to 7.8% from about 9% at the start of the year.Stock prices are about 140 points lower than the peak of 2791.41 reached on the Dow industrial average Oct. 9
if there was such a move, it would take about three days to complete the loose ends of the transaction

who last week resigned as president and chief executive of Qintex Entertainment Inc. "for personal reasons" just as the company filed for bankruptcy-law protection
David Evans has been temporarily reappointed to both positions, the company said. Qintex Entertainment also said Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Jonathan Lloyd, 37 years old, would join the nine-member board

Qintex Entertainment -- which is 43%-owned by Qintex Australia -- found itself facing problems of its own.And the relationship between Qintex Entertainment and the Australian company appears to be quickly deteriorating
Qintex Entertainment was depending on Qintex Australia to arrange financing.But early on Oct. 19, the second of two hectic days of board meetings, Mr. Evans said he believed Qintex Australia wouldn't be forthcoming
He recommended that the company file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code before the MCA deadline, according to a source familiar with the sessions. But a majority of the board, which includes three members from the Australian company, overrode him
Last week the company indicated it would cut back on the working capital it would supply to Qintex Entertainment.a Qintex Entertainment shareholder filed suit in federal court in Los Angeles charging Qintex Australia with misleading shareholders about Qintex Entertainment's financial position

One of the more bizarre garden stories since Eden has been unfolding for four years now, in the private paper-and-crayon fantasies of artist Jennifer Bartlett.And if she and the Battery Park City Authority have their way, her horticulturally inept plan will soon go public as a real garden "artwork" in the downtown complex

Last year she boasted to HG magazine: "I'd never looked at a garden in my life." And she proved no shirking violet in her initial statement to the BPCA, a New York State public benefit corporation: "The only thing I was interested in doing was a very complicated garden, which would cost an enormous amount of money and be very expensive to maintain
The BPCA called its team a "stunning" collaboration. After four years, though, the South Gardens design is 100% uncollaborated Jennifer Bartlett
She has done little more than recycle her standard motifs -- trees, water, landscape fragments, rudimentary square houses, circles, triangles, rectangles -- and fit them into a grid, as if she were making one of her gridded two-dimensional works for a gallery wall
She has done little more than recycle her standard motifs -- trees, water, landscape fragments, rudimentary square houses, circles, triangles, rectangles -- and fit them into a grid, as if she were making one of her gridded two-dimensional works for a gallery wall.But for South Gardens, the grid was to be a 3-D network of masonry or hedge walls with real plants inside them

that she absolutely did not believe in compromise or in giving in to the client "because I don't think you can do watered-down versions of things
This was never a problem with South Gardens, because the client had long since given in to Ms. Bartlett's every whim
My loft was 50 by 100 feet, so 50 feet by 50 feet seemed like a good garden room
Ms. Bartlett blithely suggested calling upon "semi-skilled garden club workers for maintenance.she had insisted on paths so narrow (five to eight feet) and hedge corners so square that standard maintenance equipment -- trucks or cherry pickers -- couldn't maneuver

I read the exerpts of Wayne Angell's exchange with a Gosbank representative ("Put the Soviet Economy on Golden Rails," editorial page, Oct. 5) with great interest, since the gold standard is one of my areas of research

Mr. Breeden backed most of the provisions in a market-reform bill that the SEC brought to the subcommittee last year under then-chairman David Ruder.the new chairman vehemently opposed a provision in the bill that would give the agency the right to close the markets at times of stress

Senate Democrats who favor cutting the capital-gains tax aren't ready to line up behind the leading Senate proposal.Oregon Sen.

that Henry Kravis and other KKR directors of SCI TV would resign from the board once the restructuring is completed
Investors interpreted the KKR move as a desire by the firm to wash its hands of SCI TV.that with only a 15% equity stake, it wouldn't be appropriate for KKR to keep board representation
KKR already has made about $1 billion of gains from earlier transactions with SCI TV, thus it isn't significantly affected by the company's troubles
KKR would give up a 31% equity stake to bondholders, while Mr. Gillett would surrender an 8% stake
While one big SCI TV investor thinks that's pretty generous, many junkholders had been hoping that KKR and Mr. Gillett would invest new money in SCI TV
SCI TV's debt restructuring plan would defer payment of $153 million of bank debt.It also would defer interest and principal on junk bonds that have fallen due

Bethlehem Steel Corp. posted a 54% drop in third-quarter profit.two more of the nation's top steelmakers -- Armco Inc. and National Intergroup Inc. -- reported lower operating earnings in their steel businesses
It doesn't bode well for coming quarters.several steelmakers will report actual losses through the third quarter of 1990

Wall Street would like UAL Corp. 's board to change its mind about keeping the company independent.But what happens next in the continuing takeover drama may depend more on the company's two most powerful and fractious unions: the pilots and machinists
that the collapse of the previous $6.79 billion buy-out, if anything, may have strengthened the hands of these two labor groups.both may now have virtual veto power over any UAL transaction
One reason: banks probably will insist on labor harmony before they agree to put up cash for any new bid or even a less-ambitious recapitalization plan
If you have both {labor} groups on strike, you've got no revenue
If you have both {labor} groups on strike, you've got no revenue and that's a very scary thing for a bank to be looking at
where the union would stand if another bid or recapitalization became possible
to be more aggressive if a second buy-out attempt occurs
The two unions already had significant leverage.their employer has yet to settle with either on new contracts
That gives them both the threat of a strike and the ability to resist any wage concessions that may be necessary to make a transaction work. Thus, even investors who are pushing for the board to do a recapitalization that would pay shareholders a special dividend and possibly grant employees an ownership stake acknowledge that the unions are key
the UAL board should be ousted if it doesn't move soon to increase shareholder value
The pilots will be involved in any transaction that takes place around here.whether the pilots can team up with their longtime adversaries, the machinists, is another question
his union would like majority ownership for employees.the machinists have always opposed majority ownership in principle
On the other hand, the machinists have always opposed majority ownership in principle.in recent days, machinists' union leaders have shown some new flexibility
If a compromise can't be reached.they can do a transaction without the support of the machinists
If a compromise can't be reached, the pilots maintain they can do a transaction without the support of the machinists.But at this point, that may just be wishful thinking
The machinists lobbied heavily against the original bid from UAL pilots and management for the company.Their opposition helped scare off some Japanese banks. The pilots' insistence on majority ownership also may make the idea of a recapitalization difficult to achieve
a recapitalization involving employee ownership would succeed only if the pilots relent on their demand for control
Ms. Browning says she believes a recapitalization involving employee ownership would succeed only if the pilots relent on their demand for control.She also notes that even if the pilots accept a minority stake now, they still could come back at a later time and try to take control

The results include a $130.2 million write-down of the securities in the high-yield portfolio to the lower of their cost or market value. Columbia also added $227.3 million to reserves for losses on the portfolio
Previously, Columbia didn't have to adjust the book value of its junk-bond holdings to reflect declines in market prices, because it held the bonds as long-term investments
Because Columbia now must sell the bonds within five years, accounting rules require the thrift to value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices
The loss stems from $357.5 million of write-downs on Columbia's $4.4 billion high-yield investment securities portfolio.The quarterly results also reflected $21.4 million in non-recurring losses from commercial real-estate activities in California
that the thrift was "disappointed" by the effects of the accounting changes.Columbia remains "one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the industry," based on the economic value of its assets and tangible capital
The price of Columbia shares has been cut nearly in half since August.investors apparently realized that the thrift would be forced to take a big write-down
they don't know how quickly they will dispose of the thrift's junk bonds, because federal regulations, such as those that would allow thrifts to continue holding the bonds in separately capitalized subsidiaries, haven't yet been completed
Columbia officials said they don't know how quickly they will dispose of the thrift's junk bonds, because federal regulations, such as those that would allow thrifts to continue holding the bonds in separately capitalized subsidiaries, haven't yet been completed.

Democrats voted to override by a 3-1 margin, but Republicans were equally firm in support of the president, who has threatened to make abortion a decisive issue on at least three separate fiscal 1990 spending bills

The action came as Congress sent to the president last night a stopgap spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide $2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake

By a lopsided 97-1 margin, the Senate approved the measure after attaching further provisions sought by the influential California delegation and, despite reservations, the House adopted the bill on a 303-107 roll call
The package is more than $1 billion above the recommendations of Budget Director Richard Darman this week.But given the political importance of California, the administration was content to use its influence to prevent any Senate amendments adding further new appropriations
appropriated after Hugo struck the Carolinas and Caribbean last month
The $2.85 billion measure comes on top of $1.1 billion appropriated after Hugo struck the Carolinas and Caribbean last month, and these totals don't reflect the additional benefit of low-interest disaster loans
In direct cash assistance, $1 billion is provided in federal highway construction funds, and $1.35 billion is divided between general emergency aid and a reserve to be available to the president to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters
The emergency assistance wouldn't be counted against a state's normal allocation of annual highway funds, and the bill circumvents existing restrictions that otherwise would prevent the use of federal aid to repair a toll road, such as the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge damaged in last week's earthquake
The underlying stopgap bill is the second required by Congress this fall and, since the current fiscal year began Oct. 1, only the Energy and Interior departments are operating on permanent appropriations enacted into law

The investment boom is mainly sparked by strong domestic demand and isn't likely to increase exports sharply.much investment isn't aimed at increasing capacity
14.2% of their spending is designed to improve products or add new ones, 17.5% is to cut costs, 12.5% is for research and development, and the rest is for maintenance and other purposes
Some economists -- and many Japanese companies -- are puzzled by the warnings.the worriers remain unconvinced
With Japan running enormous trade surpluses against much of the world, they think that Japan should meet the increased domestic demand by importing more.And eventually domestic demand will weaken, forcing companies to emphasize exports again
If there's a further drive to export.that'll be a problem
Even in the short run, the investment boom could exacerbate a disturbing trend.Japanese auto makers are increasing their production capacity in the U.S
Japanese auto makers, for example, are increasing their production capacity in the U.S.; the additional production should, in part, replace imported vehicles with locally manufactured ones.But although Japanese companies increased their U.S. auto output by 42% from January to September compared with the year-earlier period, their exports to the U.S. will drop only 9% this year

Once one Japanese company steps up its investments, the whole industry follows
Because most businesses put market share above profitability, to let a competitor's addition to capacity go unmatched is to concede defeat

Japanese managers can't expect Americans to behave as if they were Japanese; instead, they must manage Americans as Americans
to conform to the Japanese culture when in Japan
the Japanese to conform to American norms when they locate here
Americans place native or native speakers in charge of subsidiaries overseas.European multinationals do likewise; even in America, their affiliates are usually run by American managers.But the Japanese insist upon Japanese managers everywhere they set up shop
While Mr. Kageyama does an excellent job of explaining the differences, both cultural and philosophic, I question his perspective
Would he suggest that employees of an American company doing business in Japan conform to their new bosses' culture and philosophy?Obviously not.Thus the conclusion is that the burden rests with management to understand/adopt the culture and philosophy of the country in which they are operating
The workers can be motivated, and the company reach its full potential
The workers can be motivated, and the company reach its full potential, only when management embraces the employees' perspective
A manager should not have to rebut the opinions of his employees about the style of his management.Instead, he should listen to see how that criticism can be used constructively to advance his objective of carrying out a set of tasks through the efforts of his subordinates
When the response to criticism is only a better explanation of policies without altering the reasons for the criticism.that Mr. Kageyama has still failed to attack the root cause of the problem and is simply treating symptoms
Suddenly, George Bush the pro-choice advocate became George Bush the anti-abortionist.And the vacillation didn't end there

Just a month ago, Mr. Bush sternly threatened to veto a pending welfare bill if it provided any abortion funds, except to save a woman's life.Then, two weeks ago -- declaring that "I'm not looking for any conflict over this" -- the president said he would consider a compromise to fund abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest. But only four days after that, Mr. Bush resurrected the veto threat. "I do not support federal funding for abortions except where the mother's life is threatened," he proclaimed, and finally vetoed the measure last weekend
if you ask me, `Is this man a true believer? ' I don't know
Anti-abortion forces regard him as at best an uncertain ally.abortion-rights forces remain bitterly critical
For most of the past nine years, he has striven to convince anti-abortion activists of his stalwart support for their position.But ever since the Supreme Court's Webster vs.Reproductive Health Services decision this year changed the political landscape of the abortion issue, the president seemingly has tried just as hard to avoid saying anything more unless pressed to the wall

The political risk would be far less if the president drew a firm line and hewed to it
If you have a position, you're better off to stick with it than to move around very much
By his moderate Republican heritage as well as the warnings of political advisers who say the issue is vital to younger voters, the president might seem to have at least some sympathy with abortion-rights arguments.Yet he is also firmly bound by his hard-line rhetoric and promises he made to anti-abortion activists during his long pursuit of the White House

On many issues -- flag-burning, for instance -- his keen political sensitivities overcome such conflicts. But Mr. Bush and his advisers miscalculated the politics of the abortion issue, failing to grasp how dramatically the abortion-rights movement would be aroused following last summer's Supreme Court decision to restrict those rights in the Webster case
when others raise the subject of abortion, the usually loquacious president can be close-mouthed almost to the point of curtness
In 1974, as the U.S. representative to the United Nations, he wrote an introduction to a book on world population in which he boasted of his leadership during his term in Congress in expanding family-planning services for the poor.Running for president in early 1980, he was also quoted as supporting federal funding for abortions in cases of rape, incest and to save the life of the mother
In his Rolling Stone interview in 1980, Mr. Bush volunteered his abortion-rights remarks to contrast himself with his rival, Ronald Reagan.As Mr. Reagan's running mate, though, Mr. Bush plunged headlong into the anti-abortion position
that he would support a constitutional amendment banning abortions except in cases of rape, incest and life endangerment, but that he opposed federal funding in all but the latter case
His rhetoric gathered momentum as he rolled into office
His rhetoric gathered momentum as he rolled into office, affirming his "firm support of our cause" during an anti-abortion rally three days after his inauguration last January.He again urged passage of a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion.

When we look closely at our own history, it is clear that our constitutionally mandated civil rights have evolved not through the goodness of people's hearts but through legislation and constitutional amendments
This is how American women won the right to vote.And it is how African-Americans and other minority groups were guaranteed their equal rights as citizens in this nation
Disabled Americans have had their civil rights guaranteed in all federally funded programs since Section 504 was passed as a part of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act
Donald DeScenza, an independent analyst in New Canaan, Conn., said he was "impressed with the company's performance.Harry Millis, an analyst at McDonald & Co., Cleveland, said Goodyear's results "fell at the bottom" of his range of estimates

Goodyear appeared to have held or gained some market share in the U.S. for the first time since the second quarter of 1988.total U.S. tire unit sales were off about 2%
Total tire segment sales were up only about 1% to $2.2 billion.it reduced manufacturing levels at some of its U.S. tire plants because of inventory adjustments and slackened production by auto makers
In the latest quarter, Goodyear's tax rate was 51% compared with 41% a year earlier.total tax outlays were $73.5 million, compared with $44.1 million the year earlier

Mr. Icahn, the company's deep-pocketed, tenacious adversary, recently disclosed that he had raised his USX stake to 13.1%, and he again threatened a takeover
Mr. Icahn, the company's deep-pocketed, tenacious adversary, recently disclosed that he had raised his USX stake to 13.1%, and he again threatened a takeover.USX's giant steel segment is facing softening demand and slipping prices as well as increasing competition from foreign steelmakers and low-cost minimills
The import quotas got only a 2 1/2-year extension, and USX is laboring under a staggering $5.8 billion debt at a time when it must spend money to upgrade steel mills and drill for oil
Mr. Corry might have to dismember the company more than he wants to.Or he might have to incur a huge expense of either buying Mr. Icahn's stock, possibly at a premium, or paying stockholders a special dividend partly because of Mr. Icahn's pressure
In 1986, Mr. Roderick adroitly dodged Mr. Icahn's first bullet after the takeover specialist had built up an 11.4% stake

He was shocked to learn of Mr. Icahn's new takeover threat.the fiercely competitive Mr. Corry quickly showed he's no pushover
Although the board believed that Mr. Icahn is more interested in talking the stock price higher than acquiring USX, it adopted a poison-pill defense

I know it's not over," a sober-faced Mr. Corry acknowledged while greeting steel suppliers in New York on Oct. 12 and inviting them to a buffet of salmon and sushi in honor of Kobe Steel Ltd., USX's partner in a steel mill in Lorain, Ohio

And, earlier this month, he announced the sale of the reserves of Texas Oil & Gas, which was acquired three years ago and hasn't posted any significant operating profits since
What's more, the takeover occurred as natural-gas prices were falling
What's more, the takeover occurred.and just as Texas Oil & Gas reported its first annual loss in 28 years
Mr. Corry expected the Texas Oil & Gas sale to delight Mr. Icahn by addressing his concern about boosting shareholder value.But when the two men met in New York a day after Mr. Icahn disclosed the rise in his USX stake, Mr. Corry learned that Mr. Icahn wanted him to sell all of Texas Oil -- not just its reserves of about 1.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 28 million barrels of oil but also its pipeline, gas-gathering and contract-drilling operations

Mr. Icahn advocates the sale of the company's steel operations, and Mr. Corry doesn't necessarily disagree
In the past five years, USX has turned steel into a profit maker by closing several plants and reducing labor costs.But the short-term outlook is so-so
While Mr. Roderick was reared in the shadows of Pittsburgh's smoking mills, Mr. Corry grew up in Cincinnati, a city nicknamed "Porkapolis" and more accustomed to pork chops than pig iron

Indeed, Mr. Corry, at an August press conference, talked about investing in steel as long as it provides a good return and "not a day longer.shedding steel would run directly counter to Mr. Roderick's original rationale for diversifying into oil and gas

However, shedding steel would run directly counter to Mr. Roderick's original rationale for diversifying into oil and gas.the opportunity to sell steel at a price acceptable to USX may be gone, for now
About the only way that USX now can get out of steel is to dish it out, piece by piece, in separate joint ventures.With Mr. Icahn breathing down his neck Mr. Corry may have little choice but to sell at a weak price, even if it means losing some steel-related tax-loss carryforwards

Oil has long been Mr. Corry's pet.Indeed, when the Bush administration finally decided this summer to renew import restrictions -- arguably the most important decision to affect the steel industry in five years -- Mr. Corry and his directors were aboard helicopters, high above Marathon's rich oil reserves in the North Sea

When the DJIA modestly rebounded, the dollar bounced back in choppy dealings but ended the day below the levels of late Monday.Stock prices posted significant gains in later trading and closed down by only 3.69 points on the day
Analysts peg the dollar's recent weakness to an underlying slowdown in the U.S. economy, highlighted by recent economic data, particularly a surprisingly sharp widening in the August U.S. trade gap. They also point out that narrowing interest-rate differentials between the U.S. and its major trading partners tend to make the U.S. currency less attractive to foreign investors
Traders attribute the mark's surge to a robust West German economy and higher rate differentials.But, they add that the mark's strength is in part a reflection of a shift away from U.S. assets by Japanese investors into West German investments

New orders for durable goods fell back slightly in September after shooting up the month before
Orders for military equipment, household appliances, machinery and other goods expected to last at least three years dipped 0.1% last month, to $126.68 billion, after leaping 3.9% in August

Still, Milton Hudson, senior economic adviser at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. in New York, said: "If you look back a half-year or so the evidence was pretty good of affirmative strength in the capital-goods sector.Now at least there are question marks about that, and without any question the pace of growth has slowed

Your Oct. 2 editorial "Reding, Wrighting & Erithmatic" on the recent "education summit" was like most pieces on the subject of education: It had little to say.Oddly, though, on the very same page you printed a comment that addresses one of the most serious shortcomings of the American education system
Unfortunately, the comment was buried in another article, so it could not stand out in an education context

The Ministry of Construction spreads concrete throughout the country and boasts in international conferences that Japan's paved roadway per capita is the longest in the world, but they seldom think of the poor commuters who spend so much time sitting in traffic
The Ministry of Agriculture and Fishery actually is a ministry for farmers and fishermen instead of a ministry of provisions.The Ministry of Health and Welfare is a ministry of doctors and pharmaceutical companies rather than an organization dedicated to protecting the health of the people.The Ministry of Education is nothing but a cartel for licensed teachers, and certainly does not act on behalf of students.The Ministry of Construction spreads concrete throughout the country and boasts in international conferences that Japan's paved roadway per capita is the longest in the world, but they seldom think of the poor commuters who spend so much time sitting in traffic.The Ministry of Transportation serves the industry, certainly not the passengers who must pay extraordinarily high prices.

Last year, 43 million tons of desert were moved from one dune to another to recover 934,242 carats.Oh yes, the Atlantic was also pushed back 300 yards
If there's diamonds out there, we'll get to them
While other mines might yield more carats, a higher percentage of them go to industrial use
Since this treasure chest is too big to fit in a bank vault, it has been turned into one
Months after railway worker Zacharias Lewala first picked up a diamond from the sand in 1908, the German colonialists who controlled Namibia proclaimed a wide swath of the desert -- about 200 miles north from the Orange River and 60 miles inland from the Atlantic -- a restricted area, a designation normally reserved for military operations
When the Germans lost World War I, they lost Namibia to South Africa and the diamonds to Ernest Oppenheimer, patriarch of Anglo American Corp. and De Beers
Today, no one gets in or out of the restricted area without De Beers's stingy approval. The mining zone has thus remained one of the most desolate places in Africa
Jackals roam the streets at night, and gemsbok, hardy antelope with long straight horns, wander in from the desert to drink from water sprinklers

Huge machines that look as though they came from the Star Wars desert-battle scene lumber among the dunes.Mechanized vacuum cleaners probe the sand like giant anteaters; a whirring ferris wheellike excavator, with buckets instead of seats, chews through layers of compacted sand; tracks and conveyor belts, shuttling sand to the screening plants, criss-cross the beach. Then there is the artifical sea wall, 600 yards long and 60 yards thick, jutting into the ocean
When the mining in front of the wall is complete, it is moved northward
Engineers first used concrete blocks to bolster the barrier, but the ocean tossed them aside like driftwood

Laboring in blue and gray overalls, they are supposed to concentrate on cleaning out crevices, and not strain their eyes looking for diamonds.But should they spy one, the company will pay a bonus equal to one-third its value
For these workers at the bottom of the mine's pay scale, this is usually enough to overcome the temptation to steal -- a crime that could earn them up to 15 years in jail. Still, employees do occasionally try to smuggle out a gem or two

New apple trees grow slowly, and the Red Delicious is almost as entrenched as mom
The Delicious hegemony won't end anytime soon.the apple industry is ripe for change
Red Delicious has been overplanted, and its prices have dropped below the cost of production
The scare over Alar, a growth regulator that makes apples redder and crunchier but may be carcinogenic, made consumers shy away from the Delicious, though they were less affected than the McIntosh
A lot of growers won't be around in a few years.they have stopped using Alar

Federal credit programs date back to the New Deal, and were meant to break even financially.recent events indicate that federal credit is out of control
Student loan defaults remain high at about 12%, and the program has been rocked by allegations of fraud and mismanagement
that defaults in Federal Housing Administration guarantees were five times as high as previously estimated, and that FHA's equity fell to minus $2.9 billion
GAO's findings are particularly troubling because the FHA has about $300 billion in obligations outstanding and had previously been considered one of the most financially secure credit programs
If the programs continue their present path, the potential government losses are staggering

To reduce the risks while still retaining the legitimate benefits these programs can provide
If the program is meant to provide a subsidy, collecting the debt defeats the original goal
If the program is meant to provide a subsidy, collecting the debt defeats the original goal.Thus, subsidized loans tend to turn into giveaway programs, with increasing subsidy and default rates over time
government should issue credit only if it intends to use every legal method to collect
Thus, subsidized loans tend to turn into giveaway programs, with increasing subsidy and default rates over time.credit programs can be appropriate tools to improve the operation of capital markets
In contrast, credit programs can be appropriate tools to improve the operation of capital markets.legal restrictions on interstate banking once inhibited the supply of credit to the agricultural sector.Farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a reliable flow of lendable funds
In contrast, credit programs can be appropriate tools to improve the operation of capital markets.this in no way justifies the huge government subsidies and losses on such loans
There is a fundamental conflict between providing a subsidy and maintaining the integrity of a credit program.If the program is meant to provide a subsidy, collecting the debt defeats the original goal.student loans currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and mitigate problems created by the fact that students' future earnings are not accepted as collateral.The program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount.High default rates, a low interest rate, and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high.Families that do not need the loan can make money simply by putting the loan in the bank and paying it back when the student graduates
and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school
paying it back when the student graduates
The program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount.a student loan program that was meant solely to correct capital-market imperfections would allow loans for any student, regardless of family income, at market or near-market rates
While the student was in school, interest costs would either be paid by the student or added to the loan balance
Reducing those rates moderately (say, to 75%) would still provide substantial assistance to borrowers.But it would also encourage lenders to choose more creditworthy customers, and go a long way toward reducing defaults

What defeated General Aoun was not only the weight of the Syrian army.The weight of Lebanon's history was also against him
The weight of Lebanon's history was also against him; and it is a history Israel is in danger of repeating
Like Lebanon, and however unfairly, Israel is regarded by the Arab world as a colonial aberration.Its best hope of acceptance by its neighbours lies in reaching a settlement with the Palestinians.Like Lebanon, Israel is being remade by demography.In Greater Israel more than half the children under six are Muslims.Within 25 years Jews will probably be the minority.Yet Israel will neither share power with all these Arabs nor redraw its borders closer to its pre-1967 Jewish heartland
Jerusalem will become Belfast before it becomes Beirut
Unlike the Maronites, Israel's Jews will not let themselves become the weakest force in a system of private armies; Jerusalem will become Belfast before it becomes Beirut.But that is not much of a consolation to draw from the failure of General Aoun

though in general adopting a softer line, repeated the Sverdlovsk assessment
The Pentagon's recently issued "Soviet Military Power," though in general adopting a softer line, repeated the Sverdlovsk assessment.It also was detailed in Congressional testimony this past February: An explosion at the Microbiology and Virology Institute in Sverdlovsk released anthrax germs that caused a significant number of deaths
Since Mr. Shevardnadze did not address this topic before the Supreme Soviet, the Soviet Union's official position remains that the anthrax deaths were caused by tainted meat
We doubt this claim just as we doubted Mr. Shevardnadze's assurance last year that Krasnoyarsk didn't violate the ABM treaty.And just as we did not believe the tendentious claims of the Congressmen and arms-control advocates who visited Krasnoyarsk, we are in no way persuaded by the assent to the tainted-meat theory by a U.S. team of scientists who met with Soviet counterparts in Washington last year
We don't believe it.And we certainly do not believe that Mr. Gorbachev or any of his emissaries yet deserve to have the West take their word for it

The trust owns 7.2 million of the Series A convertible preferred shares, which are each convertible into 10 Manville common shares.The trust also owns half of Manville's 48 million common shares outstanding
In addition to the stock and 20% of Manville's profits beginning in 1992, the trust is supposed to receive $2.5 billion over its 27-year life.But it initially was funded with about $765 million and may soon face a cash crunch
As of June 30, it had settled about 15,000 of 81,000 claims filed and its unpaid claims totaled $136 million, a large portion of its $268 million in cash and marketable securities
Since most of its assets are tied to Manville, a forest and building products concern, the trust might also want to diversify its holdings
A Manville spokesman wouldn't elaborate on the proposed changes.But he said they are "to a large degree, housekeeping," although some may generate some disagreement

Until his labor can produce a profit in this dying and distorted system, even Solidarity's sympathetic new government won't win him over
waiting for July's usual state-directed price rises.The Communists froze prices instead
The farmers ran a boycott, and meat disappeared from the shops
On Aug. 1, the state tore up its controls, and food prices leaped
That was when the tame old Peasants' Party, desperate to live through the crisis, broke ranks with the Communists and joined with Solidarity in the East Bloc's first liberated government. But by the time Solidarity took office in September, the damage was done
Of course it's better to sell private," he says, as the butcher trundles away
He won't for long, because his old state sources of rye and potatoes are drying up
State monopolies will keep on stifling trade, "free" prices or not, until something else replaces them
Building them now will require undergirding from the West, and removal of political deadwood, a job that Solidarity has barely started.But Polish agriculture does possess one great asset already: the private farmer
There are a lot of them, and they have property
As the Chinese have shown and the Soviets are learning
Try as they might, the Communists could neither replace nor break him.And they did try

They use 60% more fertilizer per acre, twice the high-grade feed.Yet their best boast is that they produce 32% of Polish pork
I've heard from friends that state farms are subsidized," Mr. Pyszkiewicz says as his wife, Wieslawa, sets some chairs out in the sun
The state quit shoving peasants onto its subsidized farms over 30 years ago.But it never did let up on the pressure
The pension's size still depends on how much produce he sells the state.His allotment of materials also did
His allotment of materials also did, until the state couldn't hold up its end of that bargain
until the state couldn't hold up its end of that bargain.Yet the state alone sells seeds and machines
When supplies are short, it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain
Some men stay, their best friend a bottle of vodka, but two million acres have gone fallow
Without machines, good farms can't get bigger.So the potato crop, once 47 million tons, is down to 35 million
If a food crisis undid the Communists, a food revolution will make Solidarity
Vegetables are abundant and full of flavor in Poland, the pickles and sauerkraut sublime, the state monopolies long broken.Grain, milk and meat come next
A private challenge to the monolithic tractor industry will take more time and money than Poland can spare, although a smokehouse or a local dairy can spring up fast
I hire transportation, and my customers have fresh cold cuts every day
If nobody buys, I bring my prices down
He has bought some trendy Western clothes, and a green Mercedes with an American flag in the window.But the meat-processing machines he picked up are 50 years old
If the situation changes, I'll get stuck with them
Rural Solidarity objected, to no avail, when Solidarity leader Lech Walesa accepted the Peasants' support
Next Spring, the two will battle in local elections.But until then, and probably long afterward, the Communists' apparat of obstruction -- from the head of the dairy co-op to the village bank manager -- will stay planted in the Polish countryside
Not even a tractor.And you want to make wicker baskets, too
The farmer leaves.And the naczelnik shuts his door
The 321-99 roll call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance, but the cost to the Treasury is sure to aggravate budget pressures this year and next under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law
By a lopsided 401-18 margin, the chamber rejected an effort to waive Gramm-Rudman for purposes of addressing the two disasters, and budget analysts estimate the increased appropriations will widen the fiscal 1990 deficit by at least $1.44 billion unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found by Congress
the increased appropriations will widen the fiscal 1990 deficit by at least $1.44 billion unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found by Congress
The budget impact will be greater still in fiscal 1991, and the issue forced a confrontation between the Appropriations Committee leadership and Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, whose California district was at the center of the earthquake last week
Because of the vagaries of Gramm-Rudman, the immediate impact is relatively small.But the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal 1991
Within the appropriations process, the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted against the share of funds to be allocated to those subcommittees that recently have had the greatest difficulty in staying within the budget
The underlying bill approved yesterday is required to keep the government operating past midnight tonight, and this urgency has contributed to the speed -- and, critics say, mistakes -- that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance
The hastily drafted measure could hurt California by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required.And the state's delegation is fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate $185 million in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this year

The Senate is expected to make some modifications today, but both the White House and Congress appear most anxious to speed final approval before tonight's deadline
Administration pressure discourages any effort to add to total funding, and the Senate changes are expected to be largely technical
Yesterday's floor action came as a House-Senate conference approved a nearly $8.5 billion fiscal 1990 military construction bill
An estimated $25.8 million is allocated to continue work in Oman.But all funding is cut for the Philippines, and projects in South Korea are cut to $13.6 million, or less than a sixth of the administration's request
But all funding is cut for the Philippines, and projects in South Korea are cut to $13.6 million, or less than a sixth of the administration's request
An estimated $38.9 million was set aside for military installations in the home state of North Carolina Rep. W.G. Hefner, the House chairman.And $70.2 million would go to projects in Tennessee represented by his Senate counterpart and fellow Democrat, Sen. James Sasser
Texas and California are traditionally powerful within the conference, but equally striking is the dominance of Alaska, Pennsylvania and West Virginia because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process
In the final trading, the House was insistent on setting aside $500 million to carry out base closings ordered to begin in fiscal 1990.But it gave ground to Mr. Inouye on a number of projects, ranging from a $11 million parking garage here, to a land transfer in Hawaii, to a provision to assist the Makwah Indian Tribe in Washington state
The House approved a short-term spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide $2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake as a House-Senate conference approved a nearly $8.5 billion fiscal 1990 military construction bill, representing a 5% reduction from last year and making severe cuts from Pentagon requests for installations abroad.House-Senate negotiators have tentatively agreed on a $3.18 billion anti-drug and anti-crime intitiative, cutting other federal spending 0.43% to pay for it
The size of the cuts isn't known, but they'll be centered in the exploration and production division, which is responsible for locating oil reserves, drilling wells and pumping crude oil and natural gas
domestic exploration and production operations had a $16 million loss in the third quarter, while comparable foreign operations earned $234 million

The received Darwinian wisdom of the day said that animals living so long ago must be simple in design, limited in scope and ancestral to contemporary species.the hidebound traditionalist reconstructed hypothetical organisms from the Burgess fossils in such a way that they could be shoehorned into familiar categories

Not long after the appearance of life, evidently, there was an explosive proliferation in the number of animal designs seen on the earth.The vast majority of them were wiped out by a succession of environmental upheavals that were too sudden and catastrophic for the normal rules of natural selection to operate

Back when the Burgess fauna were flourishing, it seems, human evolutionary hopes hung on the survival of a little worm with a backbone called Pikaia
Mr. Gould finds this oddly exhilarating; like an existentialist of old, he views our contingency as "a source of both freedom and consequent moral responsibility." I cannot help feeling that if some other curiosity from the Burgess Shale had survived instead, beings at once wiser and less boorish than Homo sapiens might have eventually gained earthly dominion

They discourage prosecutors, under certain circumstances, from seeking court orders seizing the assets of racketeering defendants prior to trial.the guidelines "are a codification and a clarification far more than a new direction

that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before a jury determines they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can ruin corporate defendants or force them into unfavorable plea bargains
In the new guidelines, the Justice Department says that in attempting to freeze disputed assets before trial, "the government will not seek to disrupt the normal, legitimate business activities of the defendant" and "will not seek. . .to take from third parties assets legitimately transferred to them." The guidelines also state, "The government's policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant's crime

When the Trinity Repertory Theater named Anne Bogart its artistic director last spring, the nation's theatrical cognoscenti arched a collective eyebrow
Ms. Bogart, an acclaimed creator of deconstructed dramatic collages that tear into such sacred texts as Rodgers and Hammerstein's "South Pacific," is decidedly downtown.Trinity Rep is one of the nation's oldest and most respected regional theaters
For Ms. Bogart, who initially studied and directed in Germany (and cites such European directors as Peter Stein, Giorgio Strehler and Ariane Mnouchkine as influences) tends to stage her productions with a Brechtian rigor -- whether the text demands it or not.And Gorky, considered the father of Soviet socialist realism, did not write plays that easily lend themselves to deliberately antirealistic distancing techniques
Gorky was a loyal if occasionally ambivalent proletarian writer committed to enlightening the masses with plain speaking rooted in a slightly sour version of Chekhovian humanism.And "Summerfolk," penned in 1904 as a kind of sequel to Chekhov's "Cherry Orchard," is a lawn party of Russian yuppies engaged in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers
And "Summerfolk is a lawn party of Russian yuppies engaged in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers.Along the way there also are lots of romantic dalliances
Despite the absence of samovars (and a tendency to turn the furniture upside down), the production is rich in Russian ennui voiced by languorous folk sporting beige linen and rumpled cotton, with boaters and fishing poles aplenty. But beyond this decorative nod to tradition, Ms. Bogart and company head off in a stylistic direction that all but transforms Gorky's naturalistic drama into something akin to, well, farce
Not only do the actors stand outside their characters and make it clear they are at odds with them, but they often literally stand on their heads
Like Peter Sellars, Ms. Bogart manipulates her actors as if they were rag dolls
even hanging them from precipices while having them perform some gymnastic feats of derring-do
The clash of ideologies survives this treatment, but the nuance and richness of Gorky's individual characters have vanished in the scuffle
when repainted in such broad strokes (particularly by the lesser members of the ensemble) it looks and sounds forced
Ms. Bogart does better with music than with words when she wants, as she so often does want, to express herself through Gorky's helpless play
whom she appointed Trinity's first-ever musical director and whom she equipped with a spanking new $60,000 sound system and recording studio
that her intent in such manipulative staging of the classics is simply an attempt to "make it new.that her fondest artistic wish was to find a way to play "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" so that the song's "original beauty comes through," surmounting the cliche

HomeFed had been one of the handful of large West Coast thrifts that in recent quarters had counteracted interest-rate problems dogging the industry by keeping a lid on problem assets and lending heavily into the furious California housing market.HomeFed's loan originations and purchases plunged 26% in the quarter, to $1.4 billion from $1.9 billion a year earlier
However, HomeFed's loan originations and purchases plunged 26% in the quarter, to $1.4 billion from $1.9 billion a year earlier.non-performing assets rose to $593 million from $518.7 million
sales of such properties were slower than anticipated in the third quarter, but it expects sales to pick up in the rest of the year
Any such downturn in California would be grim news for West Coast thrifts, particularly the less healthy ones, which have performed poorly even with a torrid market.it purposely curbed loan originations in the quarter because of uncertainty over the new capital requirements and regulations that will emerge from negotiations over implementing the government's massive thrift bailout bill

Interest rates generally began declining last spring after moving steadily upward for more than a year
The average yield on six-month broker-sold CDs rose to 8.29% from 8.05% and on one-year CDs the average yield rose to 8.30% from 8.09%
Only CDs sold by major brokerage firms posted significant increases in average yields in the latest week, reflecting increased yields on Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction.So-called jumbo CDs, typically in denominations of $90,000 and up, also usually follow T-bills and interest rate trends in general more than those aimed at small investors
The average yield on threemonth jumbos rose to 8.00% from 7.96%, while the two-year average fell by the same amount to 7.89%
The small changes in averages reflect generally unchanged yields at many major banks.Some lowered yields significantly
Some, however, lowered yields significantly.At Chase Manhattan Bank in New York the yield on a small denomination six-month CD fell about a quarter of a percentage point to 8.06%

Benjamin Jacobson & Sons has been the New York Stock Exchange specialist firm in charge of trading stock in UAL Corp. and its predecessors since the early 1930s. But the firm has never had a day like yesterday
When it did a half-hour into the session, it was priced at $150 a share, down more than $28 from Monday's close
It sank further to as low as $145, but a big rally developed in the last half hour, pushing the stock back up to close at $170, down just $8.375 from Monday
Munching pizza when they could

It was chaotic.But we like to call it 'controlled chaos

When Mr. Jacobson walked into the office at 7:30 a.m. EDT, he announced: "OK, buckle up
UAL, which closed on the Big Board Monday at $178.375 a share, traded in the third market afterward
In the 45 minutes before the 9:30 opening bell, the Jacobson specialists kept getting sell orders, heavier than they imagined.And at 9:15, they posted a $135 to $155 "first indication," or the price range in which the stock would probably open
That range was quickly narrowed to $145 to $155, although traders surrounding the post were told that $148 to $150 would be the likely target
When UAL finally opened a half hour late, some 400,000 shares traded at $150
On that earlier day, the stock's trading was halted at a critical time so the specialists could catch their breath
Mr. Jacobson, his gray hair flying, didn't wear out his red-white-and-blue sneakers, but he sweat so much he considered sending out for a new shirt
Mr. Bates usually handles day-to-day UAL trading on his own.But yesterday, the heavy trading action eventually consumed not only Messrs.Jacobson and Bates but four other Jacobson partners, all doing their specialist-firm job of tugging buyers and sellers together and adjusting prices to accommodate the market
About 30 floor traders crammed near the UAL post most of the day, and probably hundreds more came and went -- a "seething mass," as one trader described it
The Bear Stearns order that marked the late-day turnaround caused a "massive buying effort" as UAL jumped $20 a share to $170 in the last half hour

The results surprised many analysts, because USAir has almost no competition in its Pittsburgh hub and has expanded operations by completing its acquisition of Piedmont Airlines

Next to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts's megabillion RJR Nabisco deal, SCI Television is small fry. But the troubles of SCI TV are a classic tale of the leveraged buy-out excesses of the 1980s, especially the asset-stripping game
that went bad after piling on debt
SCI TV isn't just another LBO that went bad after piling on debt -- though it did do that
SCI TV's buy-out was an ace in the hole for Mr. Kravis and for investors in KKR partnerships.But it has left holders of SCI TV's junk bonds holding the bag, including some heavyweights that KKR might need to finance future deals, such as Kemper Financial Services, First Executive, Columbia Savings & Loan and Prudential Insurance Co. of America
Some junk-holders are said to be considering legal action against KKR or moves to force SCI TV into bankruptcy court.And KKR's majority partner in SCI TV's buy-out, Nashville, Tenn., entrepreneur George Gillett, also is said to be very unhappy

KKR loaded up the cable and television company with debt in an 1985 buy-out, then later sold Storer's cable operations at a fat profit
KKR loaded up the cable and television company with debt in an 1985 buy-out, then later sold Storer's cable operations at a fat profit
In this second LBO, KKR with one hand took more than $1 billion of cash out of the TV company's assets and moved it into the Storer cable operations, making them more valuable in a 1988 sale. (Storer also took $125 million of junior SCI TV bonds as partial payment for the TV assets
With the other hand, KKR put back into SCI TV less than 10% of the cash it had taken out, buying SCI TV common and preferred shares. So, while KKR today has an estimated $250 million sunk in now-shaky SCI TV, including equity and debt, the LBO firm still is $1 billion ahead on the SCI TV buy-out after taking cash up front

that if SCI TV had to be liquidated today, it might fetch 30% less than in the 1987 buy-out, wiping out most of the company's junk-holders and its stockholders.SCI TV can barely pay its cash interest bill, and to stay out of bankruptcy court it must soon reschedule a lot of bank loans and junk bonds that have fallen due
Meanwhile, SCI TV can barely pay its cash interest bill, and to stay out of bankruptcy court it must soon reschedule a lot of bank loans and junk bonds that have fallen due
Negotiations "have started con- structively, but that's not to say we like this particular offer
No major player in the SCI TV deal will talk publicly.But it's understood that Mr. Kravis is disappointed that Mr. Gillett didn't manage to boost SCI TV's operating profit after the buy-out
SCI TV can survive if lenders extend its debt payments until TV stations rise in value again
if lenders extend its debt payments until TV stations rise in value again
They would both give part of their combined $50 million in common equity in SCI TV to holders of SCI TV's $488 million of junk bonds, as a carrot to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company. But some militant SCI TV junk-holders say that's not enough
Junk-holders say they have a stick to beat KKR with.others say junk-holders have nothing to gain by putting SCI TV into bankruptcy-law proceedings
While KKR doesn't control SCI TVwhich is unusual for a KKR investment -- it clearly has much deeper pockets than Mr. Gillett

Prenatal diagnosis of genetic defects as early as the sixth week of pregnancy is increasingly common today.But the mouse experiment at a Medical Research Council laboratory in London shows genetic defects can be detected three days after conception using a new American-developed gene-copying technique
before the new embryo had become implanted in the uterus, it was washed out of the mother mouse
One cell was teased out, and its DNA extracted
such embryo diagnosis can be used by couples at high risk of passing a genetic defect to a child.infertile couples who have the woman's eggs fertilized in the test tube usually have several eggs fertilized at a time.When the fertilized cells divide to eight cells, a single cell from each embryo can be tested for genetic defects.A healthy embryo can be picked for implantation and defective ones discarded

to make a bid for all of the British auto maker when restrictions on its shareholding are lifted
The British government currently forbids any outside investor from holding more than 15% of the company's shares without permission until Dec. 31, But with its stake in Jaguar, which it raised yesterday to 11.95%, Ford could convene a special Jaguar shareholders' meeting and urge holders to vote to drop the restriction sooner
Analysts have been expecting a GM-Jaguar pact that would give the U.S. car maker an eventual 30% stake in the British company and create joint ventures that would produce an executive-model range of cars.But the specter of Ford eventually launching a full-fledged bid could unravel the GM-Jaguar talks
It wouldn't surprise me if {Jaguar executives} want to wait and see what the color of that {Ford bid} is" first
Sir John Egan, Jaguar's chairman, so far has refused to meet with Ford officials, but he is believed to be willing to consider a specific bid proposal
Both Ford and GM badly need a luxury brand to combat new competition from the Japanese in the European and U.S. markets.And financially strapped Jaguar has spent over a year looking for a rich uncle to provide cash and technological know-how
The company has expressed a preference for GM over Ford because GM has promised it would keep Jaguar independent
when it abandoned a four-year effort to market its German-built Merkur Scorpio sedan as a European luxury import in the U.S. Then, last Friday, Ford's talks about a possible alliance with Saab-Scania AB of Sweden collapsed
Its Opel line has a solid image and a recent string of highly successful new models, but it lacks Jaguar's cachet
GM's interest in Jaguar reflects a desire to help diversify the U.S. company's products in the growing luxury-car segment of the market.GM officials also see a lot of potential in marrying Jaguar's cars to the technological know-how of Group Lotus PLC, a British engineering and specialty car maker GM bought in 1986

Theoretically, jurors are supposed to weigh the evidence in a case logically and objectively.that they start with firmly entrenched attitudes and try to shoe-horn the facts of the case to fit their views
If it is a case in which the client seeks punitive damages, for example, depressed, underemployed people are far more likely to grant them
Since Litigation Sciences generally represents the defense, its job is usually to help the lawyers identify and remove such people from the jury

This became apparent as game one, a Sicilian Defense by Mr. Kasparov, proceeded
No human can examine millions of moves, but Mr. Kasparov, using his ineffably powerful brain, consistently found very good ones
After eight moves by each side, the board was the same as in a game in which Nigel Short of Great Britain fought the champion to a draw in 1980.But the computer didn't play Mr. Short's ninth move, a key pawn thrust, and its position deteriorated rapidly

When most spectators thought its position hopeless, the computer thought it was only, in effect, one-half of a pawn down

While D.T. shuffled its king back and forth in a defensive crouch, Mr. Kasparov maneuvered the knight to a dominant outpost
Mr. Kasparov maneuvered the knight to a dominant outpost.He also launched a kingside storm, sacrificing a pawn to denude D.T.'s king
This left the computer with a broader range of plausible replies -- and it immediately blundered by moving a queenside pawn, to the neglect of kingside development
As early as move six, Mr. Kasparov deviated from a well-known sequence of moves, developing a knight instead of making a standard bishop attack against the computer's advanced knight.This left the computer with a broader range of plausible replies -- and it immediately blundered by moving a queenside pawn, to the neglect of kingside development. "In a new position just after the opening, a computer will have serious problems," Mr. Kasparov said later
In such positions you have to create something new, and the computer isn't able to do that right now
Greedily, it grabbed a pawn, at the cost of facing a brutal attack.And when a defensive move was called for, D.T. passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats

In a hopeless position, the computer resigned rather than make its 37th move.And Mr. Kasparov, to cheers and applause, marched back into the analysis room
Undeterred, D.T.'s handlers vowed to press on.Indeed, three of them will be building a successor machine for International Business Machines Corp
Reaching for that extra bit of yield can be a big mistake.you don't understand what you're investing in
Yields on five-year CDs at major banks were averaging about 7.45%, and 10-year Treasury notes were paying less than 8%
The CD seemed like a great deal. But nearly 3 1/2 years later, Merrill says the investment is worth about $43,000 -- an amount that represents an annual return of just over 2% on Dr. Blumenfeld's $40,000
that the CD he bought for a retirement plan wasn't a plain vanilla CD. Instead, his Merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon CD
Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4% when it was issued in 1984, and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then, part of the price Dr. Blumenfeld paid was a premium -- an additional amount on top of the CD's base value plus accrued interest that represented the CD's increased market value
Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4% when it was issued in 1984
Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4% when it was issued in 1984, and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then
Now the thrift that issued the CD is insolvent, and Dr. Blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium isn't insured under federal deposit insurance
The tip-off came when he opened a recent Merrill Lynch statement and found that the CD's "estimated current market value" had plummeted by $9,000 in a month
he paid when he bought the CD
that the $9,000 drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the CD, and that the amount wasn't insured
that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon CD and that he had previously invested in TIGRs (Treasury Income Growth Receipts), a type of zero-coupon Treasury security sold by Merrill Lynch

If the price paid for a CD purchased in the secondary market . . . is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero-coupon CDs, the difference . . . is not insured
Computations involving zero-coupon CDs are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant
Those officials say there was full disclosure of the risks in a "fact sheet" sent to all CD investors with their confirmation of sale.Merrill Lynch has agreed that if the thrift that issued Dr. Blumenfeld's CD, Peoples Heritage Federal Savings & Loan Association in Salina, Kan., is liquidated and the CD terminated, the brokerage firm would cover the premium Dr. Blumenfeld paid

it's impossible to estimate how many investors are in Dr. Blumenfeld's situation.the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years
Zero-coupon CDs are only a small portion of the $1 trillion-plus in CDs outstanding, and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total
Zero-coupon CDs are only a small portion of the $1 trillion-plus in CDs outstanding, and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total.there are several billion dollars of zero-coupon CDs with various maturities outstanding
income tax is payable in the year interest is accrued, although interest isn't actually paid until maturity
Most zero-coupon CDs are in maturities of six to nine years, and they usually double in value by maturity
and Dr. Blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium isn't insured under federal deposit insurance.investors who bought zero-coupon CDs in the secondary market aren't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments isn't insured
But investors who bought zero-coupon CDs in the secondary market aren't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments isn't insured.People who paid a premium for standard CDs purchased on the secondary market could also find that those premiums aren't insured if the institutions that issued the CDs failed

U.S. brandy exports more than doubled last year to 360,000 proof gallons, a standard industry measure, according to Jobson Beverage Alcohol Group, an industry association.Exports of rum surged 54% to 814,000 proof gallons.Mexico is the biggest importer of both rum and brandy from the U.S. Japan, the world's third-largest liquor market after the U.S. and Britain, helped American companies in April when it lowered its tax on imported spirits and levied a tax on many domestic products.California wineries, benefiting from lowered trade barriers and federal marketing subsidies, are expanding aggressively into Japan, as well as Canada and Great Britain.In Japan, the wineries are promoting their products' Pacific roots and courting restaurant and hotel chefs, whose recommendations carry weight. In Australia, Britain, Canada and Greece, Brown-Forman Corp. has increased its marketing of Southern Comfort Liqueur.Using cinema, television and print ads, the company pitches Southern Comfort as a grand old drink of the antebellum American South. The biggest foreign inroads, though, have been made by bourbon
While U.S. makers of vodka, rum and other spirits compete against powerhouses abroad, trade agreements prohibit any other country from making bourbon
All bourbon comes from Kentucky, though Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey often is counted as bourbon because of similarity of taste
While U.S. makers of vodka, rum and other spirits compete against powerhouses abroad, trade agreements prohibit any other country from making bourbon.just as vodka has acquired an upscale image in the U.S., bourbon has become fashionable in many foreign countries, a uniquely American product tied to frontier folklore

Bush administration officials say inflation is under control.With economic growth slowing, they say they believe the Fed should ease credit even further.But for the most part, officials have avoided expressing those views in public, fearing they would unnecessarily antagonize the Fed
third-quarter earnings rose 14% on a hefty sales gain, but domestic franchisees apparently didn't partake of the improvement
Systemwide sales, which include sales at franchisee as well as company-owned stores, totaled $4.59 billion compared with $4.2 billion. But sales for U.S. franchisees were flat at best on a per-store basis despite weak 1988 figures

where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government
(a) Marxist devaluation of environmental resources, which are not produced by labor; (b) planned economies' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government; and (c) the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development, producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West
and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions
The solutions they formally proposed included lead/sulfur taxes, conservation and recycling incentives, reforestation offsets, transferable pollution permits, an ecological bank to finance pollution-reduction credits, and debt-for-environment swaps.But their most fundamental recommendation was to separate industry from the state, making it fully accountable for pollution control
A revolution takes more than conference manifestos.Indeed, skepticism was amply captured by a joke told by Poles at the conference
The Russians are talking peace.The Palestinians are talking elections.And the Poles are engaged in commerce
The world must be coming to an end.The Russians are talking peace.The Palestinians are talking elections.And the Poles are engaged in commerce." But the implications of such a shift to market approaches go well beyond the fact that Poland is already working on nationwide emissions trades to reduce smelter pollution, or that the Soviets plan to introduce marketable pollution permits in some republics next year

Market-based pollution control may consume some capital that would purchase state industries
Market-based pollution control may consume some capital that would otherwise purchase state industries.But it could also accelerate "marketization" by reinforcing industrial accountability, breaking up state monopolies, giving managers a stake in solutions, and ensuring that modernization is not reversible for failure to address environmental effects

That means simple, clear rules that secure the first large blocks of reduction, deferring more complex issues such as risk.It also means use of quantity-based pollution limits such as transferable permits, rather than price-based limits such as effluent fees
That's because quota-trained managers will likely respond better to quantity than to price signals

It will be increasingly difficult for the U.S. to cling to command-and-control measures if even the East Bloc steps to a different drummer
At the moment, Poland resembles 19th-century Pittsburgh more than a modern industrial society -- with antiquated production, inadequate environmental management, and little ecological awareness.But the continuing pressures for free-market economics suggest the conference's vision was not all fantasy

It's not that we don't know how to, because we do
It's that we don't want to.And the reason we don't want to is that effective education would require us to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular, as well as to violate some cherished vested interests

If I were to ask a sample of American parents, "Do you wish the elementary schools to encourage creativity in your children?" the near-unanimous answer would be, "Yes, of course." But what do we mean, specifically, by "creativity
Fortunately, these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood, and they have enough common sense to know what that demands
The reasons are complex, but one simple reason ought not to be underestimated
It is nice for teachers to think they are engaged in "personality development" and even nicer to minimize those irksome tests with often disappointing results.It also provides teachers with a superior self-definition as a "profession

It is nice for teachers to think they are engaged in "personality development" and even nicer to minimize those irksome tests with often disappointing results.It also provides teachers with a superior self-definition as a "profession," since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy.I myself took such courses in college, thinking I might end up a schoolteacher.They could all fairly be described as "pap" courses. But it is unfair to dump on teachers, as distinct from the educational establishment
I know many schoolteachers and, on the whole, they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching
They may not be among the "best and brightest" of their generation -- there are very few such people, by definition.But they need not be to do their jobs well
Yes, we all can remember one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days.But our education proceeded at the hands of those others, who were merely competent and conscientious

It is the kind of libel the teachers' unions don't mind spreading, for their own narrow purposes.It is also the kind of libel politicians find useful, since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency.But there is not one shred of evidence that, other things being equal, salary differentials result in educational differentials

that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the pupils -- though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons

that manufacturers face when computerizing their operations
The company unveiled more than 50 products, mostly software, that are designed to integrate the three areas of a manufacturing operation -- the plant floor, design operations and production planning.The aim is to increase the flow of information into a manufacturer's main computer network for use in business planning, marketing and other operations
that they are one of the computer industry's leading revenue sources.But many manufacturers find that communication between different computers has been rendered nearly impossible by the babel of computer languages used by different machines, including robots and machine tools
International Business Machines Corp. unveiled a broad strategy to tackle the biggest problem that manufacturers face when computerizing their operations: Most machines can't talk to each other.IBM's announcement, which was expected and will formally be made to customers today, also marks an attempt to gain credibility on the plant floor, where Digital Equipment Corp. has long dominated and where Hewlett-Packard Co. has recently gained market share

that it will take a while for all the pieces of the IBM strategy to fall into place.the specific products IBM unveiled will generally be available by the end of the first quarter
IBM's decision to invest this sort of effort into a single industry showed that it was getting serious about understanding customers' problems and wasn't just selling technology.IBM's push is also unusual in its approach to marketing
Rather than just send out marketing people to knock on customers' doors, IBM is making several hundred of its own manufacturing people available to discuss specific needs.IBM's manufacturing staff also will be able to provide software that IBM has developed internally and will be able to form teams with a customer to jointly solve manufacturing problems
IBM can obviously bring its expertise to bear on problems related to computer manufacturing, but it could also help customers on software to deal with such things as changes in engineering documents

As thrifts sell assets.they must also reduce liabilities, such as deposits
As thrifts sell assets to improve their capital-to-asset ratio, as required under the new law passed in August, they must also reduce liabilities, such as deposits
As interest rates paid depositors were lowered, thrift withdrawals exceeded deposits by $5.1 billion, not including interest credited to accounts
The downsizing of the thrift industry is well under way," said Bert Ely, an industry consultant in Alexandria, Va. "This suggests the bailout law is having a more dramatic effect than anyone would have imagined so soon." James Barth, an economist with the Office of Thrift Supervision, also attributed some of the outflow to seasonal factors
Not including thrifts under government conservatorship, S&Ls reduced their assets by $10.1 billion from the previous month, and deposit outflows totaled $3.9 billion
For the 264 insolvent thrifts under government management at the end of August, assets declined by $3.3 billion and withdrawals exceeded deposits by $1.2 billion
to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future, as the industry continues to shrink
we are going to see deposit shrinkage continue, unless we see big changes in rates
Since the bureau's estimates for the business sector provide the numerator for the productivity ratios calculated by the Department of Labor, underestimated growth rates artificially depress official productivity statistics
If this thesis is correct, it has important implications for macroeconomic policies
It may lower the sense of urgency behind efforts to enact tax incentives and other measures to increase the rate of growth in productivity and real GNP.It would also affect the perceptions of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the informed public generally, as to what constitutes a reasonable degree of price stability
In the early 1980s, I predicted a significant acceleration in productivity growth over the rest of the decade.There has indeed been more than a one percentage point improvement in productivity growth since 1981
There has indeed been more than a one percentage point improvement in productivity growth since 1981.But I had expected more
The evidence does not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth has become greater during the 1948-89 period, but all I am claiming is that the growth trend is understated
The evidence does not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth has become greater during the 1948-89 period, but all I am claiming is that the growth trend is understated. (It is possible, that further study will reveal increasing bias
Even if it is assumed that productivity rose no more than half as quickly in the rest of the nonbusiness sector, this Labor Department estimate indicates a downward bias in the real GNP estimates of 0.2 percentage point a year, on average
Because finance and services contribute 10% to final business product, missing these productivity improvements depresses the overall growth rate by 0.15% a year
The first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates (mainly employment or hours) instead of output estimates for those sectors, such as governments, paid household services and private non-profit institutions, where there are difficulties in assembling output data The second source of error in growth statistics is the use of inappropriate deflators to adjust for price changes.the official estimates understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services
Finally, the official estimates understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services
In 1985, a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance characteristics was introduced, and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed
The first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates (mainly employment or hours) instead of output estimates for those sectors, such as governments, paid household services and private non-profit institutions, where there are difficulties in assembling output data.the biases ennumerated above indicate a 0.7 percentage point understatement in growth of total real GNP
In sum, the biases ennumerated above indicate a 0.7 percentage point understatement in growth of total real GNP.For the private domestic business economy, the bias was a bit over 0.5 percentage point.the growth rates of both total GNP and real private business product per labor hour have been underestimated by about 20%
Carbide, like other companies with a heavy reliance on the so-called commodity end of the chemicals industry, was expected to post earnings sharply lower than in an exceptionally strong 1988 third quarter.But the company's latest quarter was a few pennies a share lower than the more pessimistic projections on Wall Street
It certainly wasn't a disaster, but it does show weakness" in some of the company's chief markets
the slide accelerated in the third quarter as buyers continued to trim inventories
Prices for polyethylene, a common plastic and an important Carbide product, started to fall early this year.Prices also fell for ethylene oxide and glycols, products used in making antifreeze
For the third quarter, operating profit from Carbide's chemicals and plastics business fell to $238 million from $352 million a year ago, before accounting for taxes and interest expense

Eastman Kodak Co., seeking to position itself in the potentially huge high-definition television market, unveiled a converter that can transform conventional motion-picture film into high-definition video. The move also helps the Rochester, N.Y., photographic giant ensure that its motion-picture film business
While the prototype converter is costly, it's being lauded by the infant HDTV industry as a way of increasing the number of high-quality shows that can be seen on the new medium
that they would face a severe shortage of programs once consumers begin replacing their TV sets with HDTVs
Japanese electronic giants, such as Sony Corp. and Hitachi Ltd., have focused almost entirely on HDTV hardware, and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition.And only a handful of small U.S. companies are engaged in high-definition software development
Consumers will be able to switch on their HDTV sets and get all the viewing benefits the high-tech medium offers.they'd be watching programs that are no different in quality from what they currently view on color TVs
Kodak won't disclose the cost or when its converter will be on the market, but it's estimated the machine may be available within two years
A similar machine already on the market, made by Rank Sintel Ltd., a unit of Rank Organisation, costs about $500,000. And the potential market is tremendous
If HDTV takes off in the U.S., there will be demand for some 4,000 to 5,000 HDTV converters
The converter is head and shoulders above anything else I've seen," says Richard J. Stumpf, vice president-engineering and development at MCA Inc. 's Universal City Studios.And Mr. Niles, the program producer, contends that Kodak's move is "a sound marketing decision.They can't afford to stay out of HDTV
They can't afford to stay out of HDTV.the stakes are high
HDTVs break down images into more than 1,100 lines, compared with 525 for today's televisions, providing considerably sharper detail.And the sets are wider, resembling the dimensions of a movie screen

At 500 yen ($3.60) for a handful of balls, pachinko is a common pastime, and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II.

In 1984, an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions.Then, in 1988, a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was fielded in parliament
North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans, Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral
the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes to win support in the battle against prepaid cards, or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the JSP and the North Korean residents' organization, the Chosen Soren

The Chosen Soren and the JSP immediately denied the report.And at first, neither the opposition nor the LDP wanted to pursue the issue.But the press kept it alive; as with the Recruit scandal, lists began circulating with names of people who had received money

Within a matter of weeks, less-conservative magazines reported that members of the ruling LDP had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations.the two camps upped the ante

Mr. Schuman's "Violin Concerto," which sounds more like a mildly atonal rhapsody for solo violin with orchestral accompaniment, meanders until the propulsive "Agitato, fervente." But there are ample rewards in its plaintive slow sections and virtuoso fireworks for soloist, brass and timpani
Even when I hear it played badly, I'm still humbled by the piece
I could ever feel I've contributed to it in some way, then all the hard work has been worth it

China could exhaust its foreign-exchange reserves as early as next year.imports are cut drastically to help narrow the balance-of-payments deficit

When the pilots refused, the company retracted it

They were willing to mistreat us because we hadn't shown any moxie, any resistance
A large majority of the 961 former Tiger fliers support the union, according to a union study.But though most of the 1,087 Federal pilots are believed opposed, it is unclear just how much their loyalty to Mr. Smith has been eroded

Mr. Hastings's case was particularly nettlesome because it marked the first time a federal official was impeached and removed from office on charges of which a jury had acquitted him
Although Mr. Hastings had been acquitted by a jury, lawmakers handling the prosecution in Congress had argued that the purpose of impeachment isn't to punish an individual
that the purpose of impeachment isn't to punish an individual.that impeachment aims to protect public institutions from people who have abused their positions of trust, irrespective of the outcome of prior criminal or civil cases
Mr. Hastings faced the senators and sat impassively during the first two roll-call votes, then quickly left the chamber
While he packed the Senate gallery with his supporters during some of the impeachment trial, most civil rights groups kept their distance from his case

Is the National Security Council staff big enough, and does it have enough clout, to do its job of coordinating foreign policy
He was all too aware of how a large, inadequately supervised NSC staff had spun out of control and nearly wrecked President Reagan's second term.Gen. Scowcroft has pruned the NSC staff and tried to ensure that it sticks to its assigned tasks -- namely, gathering the views of the State Department, Pentagon and intelligence community; serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out
serving as an honest broker in distilling that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out
The Tower Commission specifically said that the NSC staff should be "small.the Panama episode has raised questions about whether the NSC staff is sufficiently big, diverse and powerful to coordinate U.S. policy on tough issues
The National Security Council itself was established in 1947 because policy makers sensed a need, in an increasingly complex world, for a formal system within the White House to make sure that communications flowed smoothly between the president and the State Department, Pentagon and intelligence agencies
By law, the council includes the president, vice president and secretaries of state and defense.In practice, the director of central intelligence and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also serve as unofficial members
By law, the council includes the president, vice president and secretaries of state and defense.In practice, the director of central intelligence and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff also serve as unofficial members. But the size, shape and role of the NSC staff have been left for each president and his national security adviser to decide
that the size of the staff wasn't a problem during the Panama crisis.But one clear problem during the coup attempt was that the NSC staffer most experienced in Latin America, Everett Briggs, was gone
Gen. Scowcroft is particularly well-versed in arms control, and Mr. Gates has spent years studying Soviet politics and society
Both Gen. Scowcroft and his deputy, Robert Gates, are experts in U.S.-Soviet affairs.neither has an extensive background in Latin America, the Middle East or Asia
But neither has an extensive background in Latin America, the Middle East or Asia.In those areas, the role of NSC staffers under them have become more important
that one of the biggest dangers he faces is that NSC staffers working in relative anonymity will take over policy-making and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced State Department and Pentagon bureaus.But just as every previous NSC adviser has, Gen. Scowcroft now will have to mull at what point the NSC staff becomes too lean and too restrained

Ford Motor Co. and Saab-Scania AB of Sweden broke off talks about a possible alliance after Ford officials concluded that the cost to modernize Saab's car operations would outweigh the likely return
With the collapse of the talks Friday, European analysts expect Ford to intensify its pursuit of British luxury car maker Jaguar PLC.Saab is left to continue its search for an ally to shore up its sagging car business
that the No. 2 U.S. auto maker lost interest as it became clear that the Swedish auto maker's automotive operations had little to offer in the way of image or technology
Ford originally had seen a Saab alliance as a way to expand its presence in the European and U.S. luxury car markets.Ford and Saab had discussed a possible link between their heavy truck operations
In addition, Ford and Saab had discussed a possible link between their heavy truck operations. But the talks on a heavy truck alliance apparently didn't go far
Some European analysts speculated that officials of Saab's highly profitable Scania truck operation balked at surrendering any of their autonomy.Ford officials became convinced they couldn't expect to recover the investment it would require to make Saab's cars competitive in the increasingly crowded luxury market
that its car division had a 1.2 billion kronor ($186.1 million) loss during the first eight months of this year, slightly worse than Saab-Scania had forecast in its first-half report last month.Overall, Saab-Scania's pretax profit during the first eight months of the year plunged 48.9% to 1 billion Swedish kronor ($155.1 million) from 1.96 billion kronor ($303.9 million) a year earlier

they expect to have a friendly alliance with GM wrapped up by the end of the month.GM is hosting a delegation of members of the British Parliament who are touring the auto maker's headquarter operations in Detroit
Ford faces an uphill fight for Jaguar, however.Ford clearly views Jaguar as a prize worth fighting for, since the company's gilded brand image would give Ford a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both Europe and the U.S
But Ford clearly views Jaguar as a prize worth fighting for, since the company's gilded brand image would give Ford a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both Europe and the U.S
Last week, Ford encountered a setback in its effort to broaden its U.S. luxury offerings when it was forced to abandon a four-year-old effort to market its German-built Scorpio sedan in the U.S. as a luxury import under the Merkur brand name
But Ford clearly views Jaguar as a prize worth fighting for, since the company's gilded brand image would give Ford a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both Europe and the U.S.despite the GM-Jaguar romance Ford by last Friday had boosted its Jaguar holding to about 11% of the luxury auto maker's shares outstanding from 10.4% early last week

Up in his stadium box, their new and controversial owner, Jerral "Jerry" Jones, watches anxiously as the team bounds up to the scrimmage line
One team pays so much and the other pays more
Shortly after buying 66% of the team from H.R. "Bum" Bright for $145 million, and mindful of the Cowboys' ragged bottom line, the 47-year-old Mr. Jones set about his own round of team cuts
When he sells it, he says, the Cowboys will move to a more practical -- read affordable -- grass practice field near Texas Stadium
With a new day dawning on the sport, Mr. Jones doesn't see a place for this sort of luxury.as for Tom Landry, well, in Mr. Jones's mind, he had played out his winning years
After posting losing seasons in each of the last three years, the Cowboys needed a change
An Arkansas native, he started at guard on the undefeated 1964 University of Arkansas team that won a national championship.After college, he worked at his father's insurance company in Little Rock, and in 1966 led an aborted attempt to buy the San Diego Chargers.Years later, with cash from the sale of the insurance company, he founded Arkoma Production Corp., an oil and gas exploration company based in Little Rock. So it wasn't surprising that Mr. Jones returned to his Arkansas roots when he went looking for a replacement for Mr. Landry

To try to draw more fans, he has dropped end-zone ticket prices from $25 to $19.Mr. Jones has also beefed up his marketing staff to sell the 118 luxury suites topping Texas Stadium
When he bought the team, only six of the suites had been sold
Last year, the Cowboys' share of that pie came to $17.6 million.The team earns between $2 million and $4 million for local radio and television broadcast rights
Mr. Jones is currently trying to jack up the price for those local rights.He is also trying to get more stations in Mexico, where the Cowboys have a following, to pick up the games
Besides signing Mr. Aikman to a sizable contract, Mr. Jones has agreed to pay rookie quarterback Steve Walsh $4.1 million over the next four years
Details of the plan, which would go into effect in 1993, are sketchy, but each player would apparently be paid a base salary keyed to his position and ability

This year, the NFL also imposed an 80-player limit on teams going into training camp, down from 120, in a move meant to trim payroll costs.And the league is trying to get more for its three-year national network contract, which expires after this season
Owners say they expect the league to demand a 50% increase, despite the fact that televised football games have had lackluster ratings.An NFL spokesman also says the league will probably expand its offerings to cable TV companies like ESPN
The new breed of team owner, Mr. Jones included, has been fighting the NFL bureaucracy for a greater say in league affairs, and the battle has produced a form of organizational gridlock
For his part, Jerry Jones says he's in the business for the long haul, and his work style seems to support that

When the Supreme Court upheld Missouri's abortion restrictions last July, the justices almost certainly didn't have drunk driving, trespassing and false imprisonment on their minds
When the Supreme Court upheld Missouri's abortion restrictions last July, the justices almost certainly didn't have drunk driving, trespassing and false imprisonment on their minds. But the 5-4 ruling may have had as much immediate impact on those activities -- especially trespassing -- as on abortion rights
that weren't part of the actual cases decided and that never were contemplated by the justices
In the Missouri case, unforeseen consequences may have arisen because the high court reinstated the preamble of the state's 1986 abortion law
that human life begins at conception and that unborn children have rights protected by the Constitution
Last year, a federal appeals court in St. Louis said the preamble was unconstitutional, citing an earlier Supreme Court ruling that states can't justify stricter abortion curbs by changing the definition of when life begins.But the Supreme Court concluded that it was premature to rule on the constitutionality of the preamble because the definition of human life hadn't yet been used to restrict abortion services

In one, the lawyer for a 20-year-old resident of Columbia, Mo., who was charged with drunk driving, argued that his client should be treated as a 21-year-old adult because his actual age should be calculated from conception, not from birth.in a case filed in federal court in August, a lawyer is arguing that Missouri authorities are wrongfully imprisoning the fetus of a pregnant woman who is in jail for theft and forgery
because of the behavior of President Barre's troops. In the port of Berbera, hundreds of men of the rival Issak clan were rounded up in May 1988, imprisoned, and then taken out at night in groups of five to 50 men to be executed without any judicial process whatsoever

The horrific details are only now emerging from a painstakingly documented report, based on hundreds of interviews with randomly selected refugees.What gives these events particular significance is the fact that they are part of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the horn of Africa
As long as the rival Soviet-backed regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam held a total gridlock over neighboring Ethiopia, the U.S. was forced to accept that lonely Berbera runway as a distant No. 2 to the Soviets' array of airfields next door
As long as the rival Soviet-backed regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam held a total gridlock over neighboring Ethiopia, the U.S. was forced to accept that lonely Berbera runway as a distant No. 2 to the Soviets' array of airfields next door.But due to dramatic events on the battlefield over the past few days and weeks, those Soviet bases may soon be as endangered and as lonely as the American runway
Tigrean armies are now 200 miles north of Addis Ababa, threatening the town of Dese.Mr. Mengistu has been forced to transfer thousands of troops from Eritrea just to hold the town

that Soviet dominance in Ethiopia is collapsing as fast as President Barre's regime in Somalia is.The U.S. has a historic opportunity both to strike a blow for human rights in Somalia and to undo the superpower flip-flop of the late 1970s on the Horn of Africa
The State Department, to its credit, has already begun distancing itself from Mr. Barre, evinced by its decision to publish the Gersony report (which the press has ignored).What's more, the U.S. has suspended $2.5 million in military aid and $1 million in economic aid. But this is not enough
Because the U.S. is still perceived to be tied to Mr. Barre, when he goes the runway could go too
when he goes the runway could go too
It is a certainty that Mr. Barre's days are numbered.The U.S. should take care that its own position in the country does not go down with him
what will come next in Somalia or whom the successor might be
Nobody is sure what will come next in Somalia or whom the successor might be.Whoever it is will have to work pretty damn hard to be worse than Barre
While the State Department positions itself for the post-Barre period in Somalia, it should continue to back former President Carter's well-intentioned role as a mediator between Mr. Mengistu and the Eritrean guerrillas in Ethiopia, while concomitantly opening up channels of communications with the Tigrean rebels through neighboring Sudan
it should continue to back former President Carter's well-intentioned role as a mediator between Mr. Mengistu and the Eritrean guerrillas in Ethiopia, while concomitantly opening up channels of communications with the Tigrean rebels through neighboring Sudan
There is simply no way to engineer a succession covertly, as is sometimes possible elsewhere on the continent.But the U.S. has one great advantage: The Soviets are universally loathed throughout Ethiopia for what they did to the country this past decade -- famine and all
The only U.S. liability in the region is what remains of the link to Mr. Barre, and that should be cut fast

that a handful of members still have enough unused capacity to glut the market and cause an oil-price collapse a few months from now if OPEC doesn't soon adopt a new quota system to corral its chronic cheaters.the effort by some oil ministers to get OPEC to approve a new permanent production-sharing agreement next month is taking on increasing urgency
So far this year, rising demand for OPEC oil and production restraint by some members have kept prices firm despite rampant cheating by others.But that could change if demand for OPEC's oil softens seasonally early next year

At that rate, a majority of OPEC's 13 members have reached their output limits.that at least three million barrels a day -- and possibly as much as seven million barrels a day -- of spare capacity still exists within OPEC
The Iraqi oil minister and Saudi oil minister Hisham Nazer insisted in their comments to the conference that their countries would act responsibly to maintain a stable market.in interviews later, both ministers stressed that they expect future OPEC quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member
If you are already producing at 95% or 100% of your capacity, what's the good to be told you can produce at 105% of capacity

Previously, no OPEC member had been willing to accept a reduction in its percentage share of the group's total output target, or ceiling.But the concept of disproportionate quotas for those with unused capacity was generally endorsed by the ministers
Libya accepted Iran's proposal only so long as it was promised production parity with Kuwait.And the United Arab Emirates, a chronic quota cheater, refused to give any guarantee it would change its ways
In the end politics got in the way.the oil ministers continue to study the plan, and it will probably be the basis for discussion at next month's meeting

when the F-18s wear out, the navy is prepared to take Rafales to replace them
Officially, the statement isn't an attack on the Rafale.unofficially, senior navy officials sharply criticize the Rafale as an air force plane ill-suited to carrier use
Although they never said so publicly, they have made no secret of their preference for the F-18 on operational grounds
Although government-controlled, Dassault still is run by the founder's son, Chairman Serge Dassault, who has fiercely protected his company's independence
The Rafale project is the result of France's inability jointly to develop a plane with other countries, and French officials question whether the state can continue paying for expensive independent programs

once Hong Kong reverts to China's sovereignty in 1997, Cathay will be forced to play second fiddle to China's often-disparaged flag carrier, Civil Aviation Administration of China, or CAAC
The fuel-efficient Airbus planes will be used largely to replace Cathay's aging fleet of Lockheed Tristars for regional flights, while the Boeing aircraft will be used on long-haul routes to Europe and North America
One step is to beef up its fleet.Cathay also is moving some of its labor-intensive data-processing operations outside Hong Kong
Fierce bidding for young employees in Hong Kong is pushing up Cathay's labor costs by 20% a year for low-level staff, while experienced, skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain
Some jobs already have been moved to Australia, and there are plans to place others in Canada
Although the June 4 killings in Beijing have hurt its China flights, Cathay's other routes have retained high load factors
Cathay is working to promote Hong Kong as a destination worth visiting on its own merits, rather than just a stopover.There also has been speculation that Cathay will be among the major private-sector participants in the Hong Kong government's plans to build a new airport, with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal
alliances with other carriers -- particularly Cathay's recent link with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines -- as an important part of Cathay's strategy.that Cathay hasn't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the U.S. carrier or with Lufthansa, the West German airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade

the airline is putting its faith in the Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong's return to China.A special section dealing with aviation rights states that landing rights for Hong Kong's airlines, which include the smaller Hong Kong Dragon Airlines, will continue to be negotiated by Hong Kong's government.But critics fret that post-1997 officials ultimately will be responsible to Beijing
Cathay would love to keep going, but the general sense is they're going to have to do something
that the carrier will have to evolve and adapt to local changes.that the Sino-British agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future

The neighborhood around Alexander Haagen Co. 's Vermont-Slauson Shopping Center in the Watts section of Los Angeles resembles the crime-ridden, deteriorating sections of many inner cities and certainly isn't the sort of area one would choose to visit.But turn into the shopping center's parking lot, and one could be in the safe, busy mall of a prosperous suburb
But turn into the shopping center's parking lot, and one could be in the safe, busy mall of a prosperous suburb
A successful low-crime mall in a high-crime area violates the more typical inner-city pattern, in which commercial areas are taken over by unruly youth, gangs, and the criminal element, with an erosion of the customer base, development capital, and insurability.Major regional and national chain stores are replaced by mom-and-pop operations offering poorer-quality merchandise at higher prices.Along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents. Thus there is even more to the Vermont-Slauson Center than a good place to shop

In the Grand Boulevard Plaza developed by Matanky Realty Group in Chicago's Third Ward, opposite the Robert Taylor Homes, 29% of the stores to date have been leased to blacks and 14% to members of other minority groups
Primarily that putting one of these inner-city deals together takes time, patience, breadth of vision and negotiating skills that not all developers possess.Security costs are also quite high
The entire site is enclosed by a 6-to-8-foot-high ornamental iron fence with a small number of remote-controlled gates.Shrubs and flowers give it a pleasing and non-fortress-like appearance.Infrared motion detectors and closed-circuit TV cameras monitor the entire center; lighting levels are three to five times the industry standard.The security command post, camouflaged as second-story retail space, has its own "crow's nest" above the roofs of the other buildings, with a panoramic view of the entire center.Local law enforcement is present in a sub-station occupying space donated by the center.These features are also used in Matanky Realty Group's Grand Boulevard Plaza
These security costs are kept off-budget because the centers' site acquisition, construction, and financing costs were reduced by such programs as Urban Development Action Grants, Economic Development Administration Grants, Community Development Block Grants, tax-free Industrial Development Bonds, Enterprise Zone tax write-offs, city infrastructure grants, and tax increment financing
Many of these programs no longer exist, or have been severely cut back.However, since these centers appear to pay for themselves, there is nothing to prevent state and local governments from enacting legislation with similar provisions

Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. posted a loss for fiscal 1989 of 980.2 million Australian dollars (US$762.4 million), the largest in Australian corporate history.In preliminary, unaudited results reported Friday, Bond Corp. also posted an operating loss of A$814.1 million for the year ended June 30
Operating revenue rose 69% to A$8.48 billion from A$5.01 billion.But the net interest bill jumped 85% to A$686.7 million from A$371.1 million
The results included a A$453.4 million write-off of future income-tax benefits and a provision for a loss of A$149.5 million on the sale of a stake of about 20% in Lonrho PLC.the tax benefits remain available and might be used later
the general financial performance of its U.S. brewing operations, G. Heileman Brewing Co., was "disappointing, and this has been reflected in the results
Now Bond Corp. has agreed to sell at least half its Australian brewing assets.It has sold billions of dollars of other assets and has more on the block. But in a TV interview Sunday Mr. Bond said, "We've taken a big loss.We've taken it on the chin.But we're out there and we're going to stay in business

Some analysts contend the total writeoffs should have been much greater, and Bond Corp. 's auditors cited a list of several assets and deals about which there is "uncertainty" regarding the current value and potential impact on the firm
the acknowledged losses mean net asset backing is in the red to the tune of 53 Australian cents a share, vs. positive asset backing of A$1.92 a share a year ago.Having fully considered all aspects of the company's state of affairs and future cash flows, the directors confirm absolutely that the company is solvent

that 26% reported difficulty recruiting personnel and that 19% said they were considering moving
their annual crime losses averaged about $15,000, with an additional $8,385 annual cost in security -- enough money to hire at least one more worker.The costs of crime may also be enough to destroy a struggling business
Small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs, if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining those businesses
The shift of retailing to large shopping centers has created even greater economies of scale for providing low-crime business environments.Since 1984 revenues of the 10 largest guard companies, primarily serving such big businesses, have increased by almost 62%
Bigger business can often better afford to minimize the cost of crime.Few small neighborhood businesses can afford such protection, even in collaboration with other local merchants
Some cities, including New York, have experimented with special tax districts for commercial areas that provide additional patrols funded by local businesses.But this raises added cost barriers to urban entrepreneurship
Increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such "hot spots" of pedestrian density
While no guarantee, an increased police presence might even deter further attacks

Global allocation funds take the asset-allocation concept one step further by investing at least 25% of their portfolios outside the U.S.This gives them the added benefits of international diversification -- including a foreign-exchange boost during periods, like the past week, when the dollar declines against other major currencies.With all that going for them, global flexible portfolio funds declined only 1.07% in the week through last Thursday

Patrician, dynamic Scott Thatcher, founder and head of PegaSys, initially finds the takeover threat risible.But, as he and his skilled team soon discover, they're up against two factors they hadn't counted on: first, a business climate in which a failing company with few assets and many debts can borrow against the assets of the successful company it hopes to acquire in order to finance the takeover; second, that standing behind AIW is a sinister consortium of much bigger, shadier and shrewder foreign interests secretly providing the money and muscle for the deal

The arbs may recoup some of their paper losses if the UAL deal gets patched up again
The arbs may recoup some of their paper losses if the UAL deal gets patched up again.the question faced by investors is: What is UAL stock worth
That's because airline earnings, like those of auto makers, have been subject to the cyclical ups-and-downs of the economy
that, despite the huge drop in the stock, UAL hasn't returned to the level at which it could attract buying by institutions solely on the basis of earnings. So anyone buying the stock now is betting on some special transaction such as a recapitalization or takeover, and must do so using some guesswork about the likelihood of such an event
that the UAL pilots and management can put together a bid "in the $225 area," but that it could take three to four months to close
that UAL's board might hold out for a new bid much closer to the original level -- even if it means that the management goes back to running the company for a while and lets things return to normal
By that logic, the closing of a deal could be much further away than three to four months.the eventual price might be higher
The pilots have a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their annual compensation by $200 million, and to commit $200 million from their retirement funds.On Friday, they also persuaded the UAL flight attendants to join them
The pilots have a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their annual compensation by $200 million, and to commit $200 million from their retirement funds.that banks aren't likely to lend the almost $5 billion that would be necessary for a takeover even at a lower price without someone putting up a hefty wad of cash -- probably even greater than the 17% in cash put up by investors in the leveraged takeover of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Corp. in July
That way someone else has an even stronger motivation to make sure the deal is going to work, because they would be losing their money before the banks lost theirs
because they would be losing their money before the banks lost theirs
Banks want to see someone putting up real cash at risk, that is, subordinate to the bank debt in any deal.Banks also want to be able to call someone on the telephone to fix a problem with a deal that goes bad -- preferably someone other than a union leader
One way out of that dilemma could be a partial recapitalization in which the pilots would wind up sharing the value of their concessions with public shareholders.The pilots could borrow against the value of their concessions, using the proceeds to buy back stock from the public and give themselves the majority control they have been seeking. But it isn't clear that banks would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to shareholders
First Boston's estimates had been higher before management supplied a 1989 projection
Using estimates of the company's future earnings under a variety of scenarios, First Boston estimated UAL's value at $248 to $287 a share if its future labor costs conform to Wall Street projections; $237 to $275 if the company reaches a settlement with pilots similar to one at NWA; $98 to $121 under an adverse labor settlement, and $229 to $270 under a pilot contract imposed by the company following a strike. And using liquidation value assuming the sale of all UAL assets, First Boston estimated the airline is worth $253 to $303 a share
Unfortunately, all those estimates came before airline industry fundamentals deteriorated during the past month

Carriers could use their equipment more efficiently, leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill.Shippers cut about $35 billion from their annual, inter-city truck and rail costs, to about $150 billion, or about 6.4% of gross national product, down from 8% of GNP in 1981.But with much of the inefficiency squeezed out of the freight-transport system, rising costs are likely to be reflected directly in higher freight rates

to notify foreign dictators if it knows of coup plans likely to endanger their lives
The existence of the guidelines has become known since President Bush disclosed them privately to seven Republican senators at a White House meeting last Monday
No notification was ever considered.the U.S. didn't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega, but merely sought to imprison him
What's more, both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House.the disclosure of the guidelines is already being interpreted on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort to pressure Congress
that "a text torn out of context is a pretext, and it is unfair for those in the White House who are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion
the committee couldn't defend itself by making the documents public because that would violate classification rules
Sen. Boren said the committee couldn't defend itself by making the documents public because that would violate classification rules. But the chairman and other committee members stressed that the notification guideline wasn't imposed on the White House by a meddling Congress
that the notification guideline wasn't imposed on the White House by a meddling Congress.it grew out of talks about coup-planning in Panama that were initiated by the administration in July 1988 and stretched into last October
The guideline wasn't a law, but a joint interpretation of how the U.S. might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a U.S. role in assassinations.In fact, yesterday the administration and Congress were still differing on what had been agreed to
notification was required even if the U.S. "gets wind" of somebody else's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator's life
notification was required even if the U.S. "gets wind" of somebody else's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator's life.the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the U.S
Although the notification guideline wasn't carried out in this month's coup attempt.that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of U.S. intelligence and military operatives in Panama
The issue came to a head last year.the Reagan administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new Panama coup efforts
The issue came to a head last year partly because the Reagan administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new Panama coup efforts.the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred by a White House desire to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign
Though the assassination ban is a White House order that Congress never voted on, the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation
The administration has reacted to criticism that it mishandled the latest coup attempt by seeking to blame Congress for restrictions the White House said have hampered its freedom of action.However, last week Mr. Webster's two top CIA deputies said congressional curbs hadn't hampered the spy agency's role in the coup attempt in Panama
congressional curbs hadn't hampered the spy agency's role in the coup attempt in Panama.the administration's criticisms appeared to have made some headway with Sens.Boren and Cohen after their Oct. 12 meeting with the president
The three men agreed to rewrite the guidelines, without changing the basic assassination ban, to clear up any ambiguities that may have hampered U.S. encouragement of coups against anti-American leaders. The new argument over the notification guideline could sour any atmosphere of cooperation that existed

Trelleborg isn't in the same league yet as mining giants such as RTZ Corp. or Anglo-American Corp But we certainly like what we've seen so far." But Trelleborg still must clear some tough hurdles
Booming metals prices have fueled Trelleborg's recent profit surge, raising mining's share of pretax profit to 68% this year from a big loss two years earlier.an expected fall in metal prices next year could slow profit growth
Noranda would prefer to break up Falconbridge, and that the Swedes -- relatively inexperienced in international mining operations -- could have problems holding their own with a much bigger partner like Noranda operating on its home turf
We'd be reluctant to accept 50-50 ownership in a manufacturing company.But such partnerships are common in mining, where there aren't problems or conflict of interest or risk of cheating by a partner

Manila is offering several major assets for the first time and is trying to conclude sales already arranged.the government is scheduled to unveil plans for privatizing Philippine Airlines, the national carrier, an effort that lawyer and business columnist Rodolfo Romero calls "the bellwether of privatization
Much of the money from the sales is earmarked for a multibillion-dollar agrarian-reform program.But efforts have been thwarted by official indifference, bureaucratic resistance, a legal system that operates at a snail's pace, political opposition and government misjudgments

The price will depend on how much Picop shares fetch on the local stock market. But according to bankers and stock analysts who have studied the paper mill, price isn't the only consideration
As it stands now, the government would continue to hold 45% of Picop after the 36% stake is sold

The list of laboratories claiming to be producing inexplicable amounts of heat from "cold fusion" experiments is slowly growing. But the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fusing of hydrogen atoms
Neither of the two chemists whose Utah experiments triggered the cold fusion uproar, Martin Fleischmann and B. Stanley Pons, were at the meeting.But some members of an ad hoc expert committee set up by the Department of Energy to evaluate the cold fusion research were in the audience
When an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum electrodes, the heavy water did begin to break up, or dissociate
Ordinarily the electrolysis, or breakup, of the water would consume almost all of the electrical energy.But Messrs.Fleischmann and Pons said their experiments also produced large amounts of heat
Ordinarily the electrolysis, or breakup, of the water would consume almost all of the electrical energy.their experiments also produced large amounts of heat
Because they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation, they asserted that the "excess" heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms inside the palladium rod

the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments' quiescent times.they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time
The bursts often occur.they "perturbed" the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied, or switching the current off and on
Typically, the input energy ranges from a third of a watt to one watt and the excess energy is measured in tenths of a watt
There isn't any way to continuously measure the amount of tritium in the heavy water, so it's been difficult to tell whether the tritium formation is related to the heat bursts or some other phenomenon
Messrs.Fleischmann and Pons initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable
A number of times they detected neutrons in one, sometimes two, of the three detectors, but only once during 411 hours of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in all three detectors
but only once during 411 hours of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in all three detectors -- and they think that was a spurious event

In subsequent experiments, one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time

ONCE YOU MAKE UP your mind about an investment, the rest is easy, right
to get burned if you don't know what you're doing
There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many ways to get burned if you don't know what you're doing. So here's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges
Not all exchanges accept every type of order.And even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange, a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer
even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange, a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer
and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers, since it imposes no price restrictions
get me in now" or "get me out now
With a market order, an investor tells a broker to buy or sell "at the market.if wheat is being offered at $4.065 and bid at $4.060, a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price
if wheat is being offered at $4.065 and bid at $4.060, a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price
that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers.Profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring brokers
Limit orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment
Investors may regret the restriction if the stock reaches 54 and then falls
if the stock reaches 54 and then falls
Unless the market goes at least one tick (the smallest price increment permitted) beyond the limit price, investors aren't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price
Unless the market goes at least one tick (the smallest price increment permitted) beyond the limit price, investors aren't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price
to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level
Once the price reaches that level, a stop order turns into a market order, and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get
Once the price reaches that level, a stop order turns into a market order, and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get
Stop orders are sometimes called "stop-loss" orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses
While stop orders sound similar to limit orders, there is a difference
Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above
Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above.sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below
In contrast, sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below
that the order was filled at $75 when the stock opened at that price on Monday
Stop-limit orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order
which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit
If it can't be made at that price, it doesn't get filled
Investors who wish to be out of a position, without the risk of receiving a worse-than-expected price from a market order, may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled.But if the market moves quickly enough, it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price
if the market moves quickly enough, it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order
But it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price
in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached
Market-if-touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached.However, unlike a buy-stop order, a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price
However, unlike a buy-stop order, a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price, while a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it
As soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price
It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better.But if the investment can't be bought or sold immediately, the order is automatically canceled
if the investment can't be bought or sold immediately, the order is automatically canceled
he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options
they don't fill it immediately, then I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price
to take more time to buy or sell an investment, if they think they can get a better price by waiting
to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order
On the close" can be added to many types of orders.market-on-close orders" must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange. "Stop-close-only orders" are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading. "Day orders" expire at the end of the day on which they are entered, "good-till-canceled orders" have no expiration date
of entering "good-til-canceled limit orders" and then forgetting about them
who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled
IN SIZING UP the risks of stock-market investments, there's probably no starting place better than "beta." But investors better not ignore its limitations, either
The beta of the broad market, typically defined as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, is always 1.0.So a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile, one at 1.5 is 50% more volatile, and so on
Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas.Go with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market. Remember, though, that beta also has important limitations
Beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret.that beta also has important limitations
There is risk that is not associated with market moves, and the beta doesn't tell you the magnitude of that
and the beta doesn't tell you the magnitude of that.beta doesn't measure the company- and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock
That "business" risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks, but it virtually disappears in a large and well-diversified portfolio
In particular, beta doesn't measure the company- and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock.Beta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own drummer

but the stocks tend to have low betas because their moves are not market-inspired
In reality it's very volatile, but the movements are not because of market movements
When you think of the words "risk" and "investment," what's the specific peril that comes to mind
If you're like most people, you said it's a holding that goes completely sour -- maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding
People tend to see risk primarily on that one dimension.therein lies another aspect of investment risk: the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others

Note that the younger couple's portfolio has a higher expected annual return, 10.1% vs. 8.8%, as calculated by Seidman Financial Services, which is the financial-planning affiliate of BDO Seidman.one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility

Of course, the greater volatility of the younger couple's portfolio doesn't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders' long-term goals.Indeed, the older couple's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return won't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans

Alarmed, state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways to certify and regulate planners.reform hasn't taken hold yet
Nobody can estimate the toll, but John Gargan, a Tampa, Fla., planner and head of one trade group, the International Association of Registered Financial Planners, thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is "humongous," far greater than that from crookery
She concedes that such a position is "unfair" to the thousands of conscientious and qualified people plying the trade, but as a consumer advocate she feels impelled to take it
that even some people who took these steps "were still getting ripped off." The bad news hasn't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning

An estimated 10 million Americans are now using financial planners, and the pool of capital they influence is enormous
The SEC has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers -- about the same as in 1980.the number of advisers has tripled to about 15,000 over the past decade
The sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult, if not impossible, to regulate.the SEC has proposed to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry-funded, self-regulatory organization patterned on the National Association of Securities Dealers, which operates in the brokerage business
When the IAFP recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners, Mr. Gargan's group was excluded
That may be because Mr. Gargan enrolled his dog, Beauregard, as a member of the IAFP

In addition, perhaps 5% of registrants will come from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials "narrowly missed" gaining them admission in the first category.

One variation that appealed to me at first was the "Money Smart Term Life" policy offered by Amex Life Insurance Co., the American Express unit, to the parent company's credit-card holders.Upon examination I wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense
and would pay me back all the premiums I put in if I canceled the policy after 10 years

that would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given the company a real profit

This is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance, the kind that amasses cash value

That's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package
to die while under its protection
This is reflected in a built-in mortality cost -- in effect, your share of the company's estimated liability in paying off beneficiaries of people who had the effrontery to die while under its protection.And in most cases, a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is, in effect, paying the salesman's commission as well

One is based on interest rates that the company guarantees (usually 4% to 4.5%) and the other on the rate it is currently getting on investment, often 8.5% or more

The stress study was undertaken because problems related to stress "are much more prevalent than they seem

Even the courts are beginning to recognize the link between jobs and stress-related disorders in compensation cases, according to a survey by the National Council on Compensation Insurance.

Import competition for U.S. furs has risen sharply since furriers started aggressively marketing "working-girl mink" and similar lower-priced imported furs in recent years
The new market helped boost U.S. fur sales to about $1.8 billion a year now, triple the level in the late 1970s.It also opened the door to furs made in South Korea, China, Hong Kong and other countries
High-end U.S. furriers say these imports haven't squeezed them.But low-priced and middle-priced furriers like Mr. Purnick say imports have cut their sales
imports have cut their sales.Mr. Rosen has turned the import phenomenon to his advantage

Aftereffects of the 1987 stock market crash head the list of reasons.In addition, competition has glutted the market with both skins and coats, driving prices down.The animal-rights movement hasn't helped sales.Warm winters over the past two years have trimmed demand, too, furriers complain. And those who didn't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages
Large furriers such as Antonovich Inc., Fur Vault Inc. and Evans Inc. all reported losses in their latest fiscal years.even those who have found a way to cope with the imports and the slump, fear that furs are losing part of their allure
He contends that chasing consumers with low-priced imports will harm the industry in the long run by reducing the prestige of furs. But Mr. Rosen responds: "Whatever people want to buy, I'll sell.The name of the game is to move goods

Analysts hailed the sweetened pension package, which they said had been the subject of rumors for several months.other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting move won't result in even greater earnings growth

These big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few "active" stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the S&P 500 or other bellwethers, much less beat it
These big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few "active" stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the S&P 500 or other bellwethers, much less beat it.

Indexing for the most part has involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to mirror a stock market barometer, such as Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, and match its performance.today, indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one
Because index-fund managers are no longer satisfied with merely being average, they have developed "enhanced" indexing strategies that are intended to outperform the market as much as three percentage points
Indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade, but the index money has been just sort of sitting there
With today's computer-driven program trading techniques, index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the S&P 500.Futures and options also make it possible to build "synthetic" index funds that don't actually own a single share of stock, but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market
After tripling in size in the past five years, index funds now hold about 20% of the stock owned by pension funds

Your Oct. 12 editorial "Pitiful, Helpless Presidency?" correctly states that I was critical of the Bush administration's failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust Manuel Noriega presented by the attempted military coup on Oct. 3. You are absolutely wrong in opining that this position is some kind of "flip-flop," something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls
Although you may have forgotten, public opinion about Gen. Noriega is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling (and simultaneous work as a U.S. operative)
It was during those hearings that the nation first learned the breadth and depth of Gen. Noriega's criminality, and of his enduring relationships with a variety of U.S. government agencies. Those hearings also highlighted how Gen. Noriega was able to use his relationships with these agencies to delay U.S. action against him, and to exploit the administration's obsession with overthrowing the Sandinistas to protect his own drug-dealing

Our government did nothing regarding Gen. Noriega's drug business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the Contra war

Speaking to reporters this week after Bank Bumiputra's shareholders approved a rescue plan
heavy lending to the property sector rocked the bank when property prices in Malaysia plummeted in 1984-85
the bank couldn't wait any longer for prices to recover and for borrowers to service their loans.So the bank's board decided to make 1.23 billion Malaysian dollars (US$457 million) in provisions for interest payments from loans previously recorded as revenue but never actually received by the bank, and to submit a bailout package to replenish the bank's paid-up capital
Once the plan is approved.most of Bank Bumiputra's nonperforming loans will have been fully provided for and the bank will be on track to report a pretax profit of between M$160 million and M$170 million for the fiscal year ending March 31
most of Bank Bumiputra's nonperforming loans will have been fully provided for and the bank will be on track to report a pretax profit of between M$160 million and M$170 million for the fiscal year ending March 31
For the previous financial year, the bank would have reported a pretax profit of M$168 million if it hadn't made provisions for the nonperforming loans
Malaysia's Banking Secrecy Act prohibited the bank from identifying delinquent borrowers.public documents indicate 10% or more of the bank's provisions were made for foregone interest on a M$200 million loan to Malaysia's dominant political party, the United Malays National Organization, to build its convention and headquarters complex in Kuala Lumpur
At the end of the exercise, the cash injection from Petronas will increase the bank's paid-up capital to M$1.15 billion after virtually being wiped out by the new provisions
When the Supreme Court opened the door this year to new restrictions on abortion, Ms. Ehman opened her mind to Democratic politics
Polls bear out this warning, but after a decade of increased Republican influence here, the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for Mr. Courter
Unless he closes the gap, Republicans risk losing not only the governorship but also the assembly next month
New Jersey's own highest court remains a liberal bulwark against major restrictions on abortion, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Webster vs.Missouri, has engaged voters across the nation who had been insulated from the issue
A recent pro-choice rally in Trenton drew thousands, and in a major reversal, Congress is defying a presidential veto and demanding that Medicaid abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest
If Webster hadn't happened, you wouldn't be here
We could have shouted from the rooftops about Courter . . . and no one would have heard us
Abortion alone can't explain this shift, but New Jersey is a model of how so personal an issue can become a baseline of sorts in judging a candidate
By a 2-to-1 ratio, voters appear more at ease with Mr. Florio's stance on abortion, and polls indicate his lead widens when the candidates are specifically linked to the issue

The Camden County congressman still carries himself with a trademark "I'm-coming-down-your-throat" intensity, but at a pause in Newark's Columbus Day parade recently, he was dancing with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city's old Italian-American ward
After losing by fewer than 1,800 votes in the 1981 governor's race, he has prepared himself methodically for this moment, including deciding in recent years he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for Medicaid abortions
If you're going to be consistent and say it is a constitutionally protected right.how are you going to say an upscale woman who can drive to the hospital or clinic in a nice car has a constitutional right and someone who is not in great shape financially does not
The Camden County congressman still carries himself with a trademark "I'm-coming-down-your-throat" intensity.Mr. Courter seems a shadow of the confident hawk who defended Oliver North before national cameras at Iran-Contra hearings two years ago
he erred by stating his "personal" opposition to abortion instead of assuring voters that he wouldn't impose his views on "policy" as governor.by stepping outside the state's pro-choice tradition, Mr. Courter aggravates fears that he is too conservative as well on more pressing concerns such as auto insurance rates and the environment
He hurt himself further this summer by bringing homosexual issues into the debate; and by wavering on this issue and abortion, he has weakened his credibility in what is already a mean-spirited campaign on both sides
Like many of his colleagues, he didn't serve in Vietnam in the 1960s yet embraced a hawkish defense and foreign policy
Jack Kemp and the writers Irving Kristol and George Gilder were influences, and Mr. Courter's own conservative credentials proved useful to the current New Jersey GOP governor, Thomas Kean, in the 1981 Republican primary here
The same partnership is now crucial to Mr. Courter's fortunes, but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate, pro-choice Gov. Kean
While the Warren County congressman pursued an anti-government, anti-tax agenda in Washington, Gov. Kean was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of New Jersey's budget in his eight years in office
Kean forces play down any differences with Mr. Courter, but this history makes it harder for the conservative to run against government
He is warm and polished before a Puerto Rican Congress in Asbury Park.Yet minutes after promising to appoint Hispanics to high posts in state government, he is unable to say whether he has ever employed any in his congressional office

He speaks for the death penalty as if reading from Exodus 21
Hard-hitting consultants match ads with Mr. Courter's team, and Mr. Florio retools himself as the lean, mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s
he scraps an old reference to Ozzie and Harriet and instead quotes the Grateful Dead
The Democratic lawmaker fits a pattern of younger reformers arising out of old machines, but his ties to Camden remain a sore point because of the county's past corruption
His campaign hierarchy is chosen from elsewhere in the state, and faced with criticism of a sweetheart bank investment, he has so far blunted the issue by donating the bulk of his profits to his alma mater, Trenton State College

A run-up in world oil prices last winter sent consumer prices soaring at a 6.7% annual rate in the first five months of this year, but the subsequent decline in energy prices has pulled the annual rate back down to 4.4%
Back in 1987-88, business was operating at fairly tight capacity, so businesses felt they could raise prices
The steep climb in producer prices reported last Friday fostered pessimism about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market's 6.9% plunge that day.In the past several days the U.S.'s central bank has allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly to try to stabilize the markets
Fed policy makers have been wary of relaxing credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy

The disarray in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at Campeau Corp. has offered commercial banks a golden opportunity to play a greater role in financing billion-dollar takeovers. But two big New York banks seem to have kicked those chances away, for the moment, with the embarrassing failure of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. to deliver $7.2 billion in bank financing for a leveraged buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp

The earnings also mark a significant drop from the second quarter's $45.3 million or $1.25 a share.Moreover, the earnings were well below analysts' expectations of about $1.16 a share

When that happened, "seismic" tremors of fear -- much like the shock waves created by an earthquake -- coursed through the market and increased the market's volatility
Panic frequently results in irrational behavior.And in financial markets, irrational behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe
When market tremors start, it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve (buy and sell orders at various prices) be made available to all, not just to market makers
Because of a lack of information and access, many investors -- including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed, because of their ignorance of important market information
Market makers buy what investors wish to sell; their business is reselling these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors, and at a profit.the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction
while any one customer may purchase immediacy by selling to a market maker (which is micro-liquidity for the investor), the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction
As a result the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction.it can be argued that increasing capital commitments by market makers (a result of some post-1987 crash studies) also increases market volatility

It's hardly astonishing (given the men's track record) that Sony wants Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters.But it is puzzling to some Hollywood executives that Sony rushed to hire them without clearing up the Warner situation first
that Sony might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring Mr. Guber and letting Mr. Peters stay on to fulfill the Warner contract.But though "people in town may ask why Guber needs Peters, it's good to have a partner, and obviously the chemistry works

In 1980, Mr. Guber got together with Mr. Peters, by then a successful producer in his own right, after the death of Mr. Bogart
While Guber Peters produced a number of hits for Warner and others, their record wasn't always so impressive
Among their clinkers were "The Legend of Billie Jean," "VisionQuest," "Clue" and "Clan of the Cave Bear." And the failures make it possible for Warner in its current lawsuit to paint the producers as ingrates

In July a year later, Warner agreed to release the producers from their old contract when Messrs.Guber, Peters and Sugarman made a $100 million offer to buy 25% of MGM/UA

Last May, he sold his 24% stake in Barris to a passive Australian investor and Barris was renamed Guber Peters Entertainment Co.Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters had agreed to extend their Warner agreement with the new five-year exclusive contract
The new deal was considered the most generous of its kind, both financially and in terms of creative freedom.But it paled by comparison to what Sony was to offer last month: the chance, at last, to run a major studio, about $50 million in deferred compensation, up to 10% of Columbia's future cash flow, 8% of the future appreciation of Columbia's market value, and annual salaries of $2.7 million for each

Sony is paying a hefty price for a company that had revenue of only $42 million last year.And earnings have been erratic
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters claim they have an oral agreement with Warner executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise.But in affidavits filed yesterday in the Los Angeles court, Mr. Ross, Warner Bros.Chairman Robert Daly and President Semel deny that such an oral agreement was ever made
For one thing, according to Mr. Daly, the producers requested a release in advance.Moreover, the old contract was about to expire, and the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner wasn't as strong as it is now
Moreover, the old contract was about to expire, and the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner wasn't as strong as it is now
Warner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights, and it was "in Warner's interest to accommodate MGM/UA, Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives
At the very least, Mr. Ross clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of flesh from Sony.During settlement talks Warner demanded such things as cable TV rights to Columbia movies and Columbia's interest in the studio it jointly owns with Warner, according to executives involved in the talks
in accepting the Sony offer before taking it up with Warner
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters refuse to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the Sony offer before taking it up with Warner.And they say there are plenty of precedents in Hollywood for letting people out of contracts

First, there's the name: "asset-backed securities." Better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing. And there's more
The assets backing the securities come from some of the country's biggest -- and most secure -- institutions.Most earn high ratings from credit agencies.Their yields are higher than those of U.S. Treasury issues.And the booming market has already attracted many of the nation's biggest institutional investors
The concept may be simple.the simplicity may be misleading
that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them -- and those are hard to evaluate
that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them -- and those are hard to evaluate.Moreover, the securities were introduced only about 4 1/2 years ago; the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession
Skeptics say the slightly higher returns aren't enough to compensate for the extra risk.They warn that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them -- and those are hard to evaluate.Moreover, the securities were introduced only about 4 1/2 years ago; the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession.Such concerns haven't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of Wall Street's hottest new products
They have sold issues backed by car loans, boat loans and recreational-vehicle loans.They have offered bundles of homeequity loans, as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time-shares.Last year, there was an issue of "death-backed bonds" -- securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders.Some predict there will be "Third World bonds," backed by loans to Brazil, Argentina and other debt-ridden nations.And the biggest volume this year has been on securities backed by credit-card receivables, sometimes known as "plastic bonds
Before the sun sets on the '80s, it seems nothing will be left unhocked
Most issues have been sold to professional money managers, pension funds, bank trust departments and other institutions.But wealthy individuals also have been jumping in, and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market

But wealthy individuals also have been jumping in, and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market
The process typically begins when an institution, such as Citibank or Sears, Roebuck & Co., takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust
when an institution, such as Citibank or Sears, Roebuck & Co., takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust.The trust then issues securities -- generally due in five years or less -- that are underwritten by Wall Street brokerage firms and offered to investors
Issues typically come with "credit enhancements," such as a bank letter of credit, and thus have received high credit ratings
the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers, while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions
Asset-backed securities "are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds.skeptics question whether asset-backed bonds offer sufficient rewards to compensate for the extra risks
who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street
That kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street.But for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have, that margin is meaningless
you're in the bond business playing the relative-performance derby, then even an extra 25 basis points (0.25 percentage point) becomes an important consideration on a career basis
If you're in the bond business playing the relative-performance derby, then even an extra 25 basis points (0.25 percentage point) becomes an important consideration on a career basis.if you're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again, then that isn't of overwhelming importance
But if you're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again
But for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have, that margin is meaningless.the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable, while interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level
Moreover, the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable, while interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level
That's why some investment managers, such as Alex Powers, a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank's private banking division, don't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax states, such as New York or California. But Mr. Powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts, such as retirement plans
to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature
You could see massive gyrations here because it's such a thinly traded market
The secondary, or resale, market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues.an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds, or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange, can simply check newspaper listings
Evaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem.Investors may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities
that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and "do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks, Citibank N.A., Citicorp or any affiliate thereof.if there's a problem, don't expect Citibank to come to the rescue
if there's a problem, don't expect Citibank to come to the rescue
The front cover of the prospectus for the Citibank credit-card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and "do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks, Citibank N.A., Citicorp or any affiliate thereof.The prospectus also notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency
Evaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem.That also isn't easy
The letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities.Nor does it cover the entire portfolio
Details of credit enhancements vary widely from issue to issue.Still, they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues
in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues -- which in turn is why the yield above Treasurys is so slim
Still, they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues -- which in turn is why the yield above Treasurys is so slim.But skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper
why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper
When you buy an asset-backed issue, you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties
If a bank's credit rating was lowered because of, say, its loans to Third World nations, that could also affect the ratings, liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports
If a bank's credit rating was lowered because of, say, its loans to Third World nations, that could also affect the ratings, liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports
Underwriters insist these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions.But despite the credit enhancements, despite the high ratings, some money managers still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets
That could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset-backed securities, as well as make it tougher to unload the latter. But it could be much worse
For one thing, credit-card loans are unsecured.that banks have been overeager to issue cards to the public -- giving cards to too many big spenders who will default during a recession
A day of reckoning is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the highest-quality debt issues, and therefore we think the best debt investment is U.S. government bonds

The respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets, but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they were a year ago.12% of this year's respondents said they expect a recession within 12 months.Last year, only 8% were expecting a recession
Apparently, the respondents don't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much.A slim majority (51%) think stock prices will be higher in August 1990 than they were in August 1989. Their verdict on real estate is almost the same.Some 50% expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next 12 months.only 32% expect an increase in the price of gold.Since gold tends to soar when inflation is high, that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control

to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts, and also to bring back income averaging for farmers, a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several years
The Senate Finance Committee voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts, and also to bring back income averaging for farmers, a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several years. As part of the same bill, the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations, in what committee member Sen. David Pryor (D., Ark.) calls a "feeding frenzy" of special-interest legislating
To be sure, the full Senate, facing a fast-approaching budget deadline, last Friday stripped away all of the tax breaks that were contained in the Finance Committee bill.But lawmakers of both parties agree that the streamlining was temporary

In reaction to proposed capital-gains legislation, groups are lobbying to make sure they aren't left off the gravy train.Real-estate interests are protesting an omission in President Bush's capital-gains proposal
If there is going to be a tax scheme that contemplates lower treatment of capital gains, they certainly want to be part of it
In the House-passed tax bill, Mr. Thevenot got his wish.Sotheby's, Christie's and the National Association of Antique Dealers are still trying to get theirs
real-estate assets are included in the capital-gains provision.that gains from the sale of collectibles also be given preferential treatment
Two of the major ways that tax-writers managed to attain these ends were to scrap the preferential treatment of capital gains and to curtail the use of paper losses, also known as passive losses, that made many tax shelters possible.Many other tax benefits also were swept away

When President Bush arrives here next week for a hemispheric summit organized to commemorate a century of Costa Rican democracy, will he be able to deliver a credible message in the wake of the Panamanian fiasco
to pay lip service to nonintervention, while they privately encourage more assertive U.S. action to remove Gen. Manuel Noriega and safeguard their countries from a Sandinista onslaught
Faced with this embarrassment, U.S. diplomats expressed confidence that the influential Rio Group of South American nations, which gathered last week in Peru, would take a stronger posture toward the Panamanian dictator.But other than a few slaps on the wrist, Gen. Noriega went unpunished by that body, too
The host, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, did not invite Chile, Cuba, Panama or Haiti to the summit, which was to be restricted to democracies.However, Mr. Ortega was included
Formally upgrading the Sandinistas to a democratic status.the Bush administration agreed to the dubious arrangement in July
According to officials in Washington, the State Department hoped that by pleasing President Arias, it would gain his support to postpone any decision on the Contras until after Mr. Ortega's promises of democratic elections were tested next February.However, relying on an ardent critic of the Reagan administration and the Contra movement for help in delaying the disarming of the Contras was risky business
However, relying on an ardent critic of the Reagan administration and the Contra movement for help in delaying the disarming of the Contras was risky business.And even some last-minute phone calls that Mr. Bush made (at the behest of some conservative U.S. senators) to enlist backing for the U.S. position failed to stop the march of Mr. Arias's agenda
In Honduras he promised to help unblock some $70 million in assistance withheld due to the failure of local agencies to comply with conditions agreed upon with Washington. Aid was also the gist of the talks Sen. Dodd had with Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani
Prior to this episode, Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) undertook a personal diplomatic mission through Central America to promote an early disbanding of the rebels.It was therefore not surprising that close allies of the U.S.
The U.S.S.R. would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to Nicaragua after the February election if the U.S. did likewise with its allies in Central America
There, Mr. Shevardnadze felt legitimized to unveil his own peace plan: The U.S.S.R. would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to Nicaragua after the February election if the U.S. did likewise with its allies in Central America.He also called on Nicaragua's neighbors to accept a "military equilibrium" guaranteed by both superpowers
Since Mr. Shevardnadze's proposals followed discussions with Mr. Baker, speculations arose that the Bush administration was seeking an accommodation with the Soviets in Central America
which declared a false symmetry between Soviet military aid to the Sandinista dictatorship and that provided by Washington to freely elected governments
This scheme would fit the Arias Plan.it is also likely to encourage those on Capitol Hill asking for cuts in the assistance to El Salvador if President Cristiani does not bend to demands of the Marxist guerrillas
This scheme would fit the Arias Plan.Furthermore, it is also likely to encourage those on Capitol Hill asking for cuts in the assistance to El Salvador if President Cristiani does not bend to demands of the Marxist guerrillas
Furthermore, it is also likely to encourage those on Capitol Hill asking for cuts in the assistance to El Salvador if President Cristiani does not bend to demands of the Marxist guerrillas

about what would happen if his much-heralded peace plan would fail
if their country is militarily attacked by either Nicaragua or Panama, the U.S. will come to its defense
A poll conducted in July by a Gallup affiliate showed that 64% of Costa Ricans believe that if their country is militarily attacked by either Nicaragua or Panama, the U.S. will come to its defense.But in the light of events in Panama, where the U.S. has such clear strategic interests, waiting for the Delta Force may prove to be a dangerous gambit
Holiday Corp. said net income jumped 89%, partly on the strength of record operating income in its gaming division.the hotel and gambling giant said it was proceeding with plans to make a tender offer and solicit consents with respect to approximately $1.4 billion of its publicly traded debt
it would retire or assume when it agreed to buy the Holiday Inn business in August
The debt issues involved and the proposed consent fees and cash tender offer prices (expressed per $1,000 of principal amount) are as follows: 10 1/2% senior notes due 1994 at 101%; 11% subordinated debt due 1999 at 102%; 9 3/8% notes due 1993 at 100%; and 8 3/8% notes due 1996 at 95.25%.its 15% notes due 1992 also will be included in the tender offer and consent solicitation at a price to be determined by Holiday prior to the commencement of the offer
Although such a venture wouldn't match the "fourth network" created by News Corp. 's Fox Broadcasting Co., MCA and Paramount may have similar ambitions
which also owns six TV stations, provides programs three nights a week to those and other affiliates
MCA owns WWOR in New York and Paramount last month agreed to purchase a 79% stake in the TVX Broadcast Group from Salomon Inc. in a deal valued at $140 million
the co-venture would target stations affiliated with Fox because Fox has the desirable independent stations in most of the key cities
Currently, Fox supplies programs on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, although the company plans to expand to other weeknights
it plans to offer its stations movies, theatrical and made-for-TV ventures, probably on Wednesdays, sometime next year.It is also planning another night of original series
Paramount and MCA, according to the broadcasting executive, plan to offer theatrical movies produced separately by Paramount and MCA for Wednesdays and perhaps a block of original shows Fridays.Paramount and MCA have also held discussions with Chris-Craft Industries' broadcasting unit

Moreover snafus in transportation funding that the state has experienced over the years may have restricted the availability of funds for such a retrofitting, even if it were technologically feasible
After completing installation of the jackets on "one frame" of the freeway last year, the state DOT had sent the project over to its Sacramento engineers to draw up a final design
encasing the concrete columns with steel, then connecting them more securely to the double-decker roadbed
Knowledgeable employees said the project had been stymied somewhat by "the difficulty of designing" the jackets.The employees also said the project may have been snagged by budgetary concerns
The Cypress structure opened in June 1957, and as such, like many buildings in the San Francisco Bay area, does not meet current building codes requiring considerably more steel support.The northern piers of the span lie in estuarian deposits that were of a type to have liquefied easily during the 1906 quake.they were as surprised as anyone by the Cypress destruction

Peter Isler, the winning navigator in the past two America's Cup challenges, has split from the team led by Dennis Conner, skipper of the victorious Stars & Stripes, to form his own team for the next contest in 1992.And, in addition to a crack team of sailors, Mr. Isler has lined up some real brass to help him finance the syndicate

After the discarded mural was found outside the school by a concerned Stamford graduate, it eventually was turned over to Hiram Hoelzer, a professional art restorer

Mr. Hoelzer, however, sued Stamford, claiming that the city had abandoned the artwork and that it had waited too long to reclaim it. But Judge Louis L.

when they select their political agents -- a Republican brand that believes in the minimalist state and in the virtues of private markets over the vices of public action, and a Democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses attendant to the pursuit of private interest
Congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office
If they put a Republican into office, not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from "bringing home the bacon" to their respective constituencies
Each legislator, after all, is only one out of 535 when it comes to national policy making
Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter's particular district/state, such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits
Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter's particular district/state, such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits
Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter's particular district/state, such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits.The individual voter's standing will be enhanced through lower taxes
Prior to the election of Franklin Roosevelt as president and the advent of the New Deal, government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner's dilemma problem confronting voters in races for Congress was considerably less severe
Third, the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office.first-term members of the House, once the most vulnerable of incumbents, have become virtually immune to defeat
Because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role in national policy making, they were more vulnerable to defeat
First, why ticket splitting has increased and taken the peculiar pattern that it has over the past half century.the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House
Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress
this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts
if the key assumption is valid, Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking
that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking
Second Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking.This is indeed what the data indicate, particularly in the case of the House
First, economists James Bennett and Thomas DiLorenzo find that GOP senators turn back roughly 10% more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do.To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking, this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns. Second, if the key assumption is valid, Democrats should have lower attendance rates on roll-call votes than Republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking.This is indeed what the data indicate, particularly in the case of the House.as shown in the table, Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices
where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices
Finally, as shown in the table, Democrats allocate a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices -- where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to Washington offices.An examination of changes in personal staffing decisions in the Senate between 1986 and 1987 (when control of that body changed party hands) reveals that the personal staffing differences noted in the table cannot be attributed to the disproportionate control Democrats exercise, due to their majority-party status, over other resources such as committee staff
Put more simply, GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner's dilemma is more severe
Put more simply, GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner's dilemma is more severe.ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level
State government is more typically split along Republican-governor/Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse.that, holding other factors constant, the difference between a state's major-party vote going to the Republican gubernatorial candidate and the Republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate
First.at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly irrational behavior voters display in the voting booth may have an exceedingly rational explanation
The measure provides no money for the promised payments until then, but beginning in fiscal 1991, the government would be committed to meeting annual payments of as much as $500 million until the total liability of approximately $1.25 billion is paid

The Coats bill isn't a pure line-item veto because it would apply only to spending bills

Banks indicated they were operating at greater than 90% of their usual capacity, but a Nob Hill hotel said tourists had fled, leaving the previously full hotel with an 80% vacancy rate.City crews tallied the wreckage to buildings, but lacked a clear sense of how gravely transportation arteries were disabled.Among the city's banks, Bank of America said all but eight of its 850 branches were open.The closed branches, in San Francisco, Hayward, Santa Clara and Santa Cruz, sustained structural damage.Power failures kept just seven of its 1,500 automated-teller machines off-line.Securities-trading operations were moved to Bank of America's Concord office, and foreign-exchange trading operations were shifted to Los Angeles, the bank said. Wells Fargo & Co. said its Emergency Operations Committee -- which met all night Tuesday -- moved its global-funds transfer system to El Monte, Calif., 500 miles to the south.Only five of 496 branches statewide remain closed, while 23 of 600 automated-teller machines remained out of order. The most extensive damage was in small towns near the quake's epicenter, 80 miles south of San Francisco.Santa Cruz County estimates total damage at nearly $600 million.Santa Clara County has a running total so far of $504 million, excluding the hard-hit city of Los Gatos. Oakland officials were still uncertain about the magnitude of structural damage late yesterday; a section of I-880, a twotiered highway, collapsed in Oakland, causing a majority of the deaths resulting from the quake. San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos estimated that damages to the city total $2 billion.That includes dwellings in the ravaged Marina district that must be demolished, peeled business facades south of Market Street, and houses in the city's outer Richmond district that were heaved off their foundations.Many streets and sidewalks buckled, and subterranean water mains and service connections ruptured. The federal funds would go to a range of programs, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, highway construction accounts and the Small Business Administration, according to Rep. Vic Fazio (D., Calif.). FEMA, which coordinates federal disaster relief, is already strapped by the costs of cleaning up after Hurricane Hugo, which hit the Carolinas last month.It is likely to get as much as $800 million initially in additional funds, and eventually could get more than $1 billion, according to Mr. Fazio, a member of the House Appropriations Committee. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there is enough money on hand to deal with immediate requirements.The Bush administration has at its disposal $273 million in funds remaining from the $1.1 billion Congress released for the cleanup after Hurricane Hugo. "We feel we have the money necessary to handle the immediate, short-term requirements," Mr. Fitzwater said.He added that the Office of Management and Budget, the Transportation Department and other agencies are "developing longer-term legislation" that should be ready soon. Much of the cost of cleaning up after the earthquake will involve repairing highways and bridges.California lawmakers are seeking changes in rules governing the federal highway relief program so more money can be made available for the state. Some things can't be repaired.The Asian Art Museum in Golden Gate Park reports $10 million to $15 million in damage, including shattered porcelains and stone figures.Its neighbor, the De Young Museum, totaled $3 million to $5 million in structural damage and shattered sculpture. The city's main library is closed because of fissures that opened in its walls, and marble facings and ornamental plaster at the Beaux Arts City Hall broke off in the temblor. The ground along the Embarcaderothe street that skirts the city's eastern boundary and piers -- dropped six inches after the quake, wreaking major damage to at least one of the piers.At San Francisco International Airport, shock waves wrecked the control tower, knocking down computers and shattering glass.Offices of the city's Rent Board were destroyed. Mayor Agnos's $2 billion estimate doesn't include damage to freeway arteries leading into the city, some of which remained closed.A major chunk of the $2 billion is expected to be eaten up by overtime for city workers deployed in the emergency, said a spokesman for Mr. Agnos. "All of the city's $5.9 million emergency reserve was spent in the first 24 hours" on overtime salaries, he said. Insurers struggled to to get a firm grasp on the volume of claims pouring into their offices. At Fireman's Fund Corp., a spokesman said 142 claims were received in the first 24 hours after the quake, and the company is braced for as many as 5,000 claims from its 35,000 residential and 35,000 business policyholders in the affected area. "Claims range from a scratched fender -- and there were an awful lot of cars damaged in this -- to a major processing plant," a spokesman said. "We're delivering a check for $750,000 to an automotive business in Berkeley that burned on Tuesday." Fireman's is part of a $38 million syndicate that supplies business interruption insurance to the city on the Bay Bridge, which must pay employees during the three weeks or more it is expected to be out of service and deprived of toll income. California lawmakers want to eliminate temporarily a $100 million cap on the amount of federal highway relief for each state for each disaster, as well as a prohibition on using the emergency highway aid to repair toll roads. In addition, under the highway-relief program, the federal government provides 100% of emergency highway aid for only the first 90 days of a repair effort.After that, the federal share diminishes.For interstate highways, the federal share normally would drop to 90% of the cost of repairs, and the state would have to pick up the remainder of the cost.But lawmakers want to extend the period for 100% federal funding for several months. Those changes also would apply to two areas hit hard by Hurricane Hugo -- South Carolina and the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to an aide to Rep. Fazio.the FEMA announced a toll-free telephone number (800-462-9029) to expedite service to victims of the earthquake

There are no easy choices in Cambodia, but we can't imagine that it benefits the U.S. to become the catalyst for an all-too-familiar process that could end in another round of horror in Cambodia
Now that Vietnam appears to have pulled out its occupation army, the State Department is talking again about accepting an "interim" coalition government in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh
Within two years, the moderates were exiled or in prison, Nicaragua had gone communist, and the Sandinistas were building one of the biggest armies in Latin America and threatening their neighbors
when the Western powers bowed to pressure for such a coalition it turned out they were opening the door to communist domination
It's not clear which crew of communists might prevail in a coalition government, but the one good bet is that the non-communists would disappear

But there is no solid evidence that the Khmer Rouge have changed.it's difficult to swallow the notion that Mr. Baker is willing to accept conditions that would help the Khmer Rouge set up shop again in Phnom Penh
True, Prince Sihanouk backs the idea of such a coalition, at least for this week.But Prince Sihanouk has backed all sorts of ideas over the years, and done rather better by himself than by Cambodia
So it's difficult to swallow the notion that Mr. Baker is willing to accept conditions that would help the Khmer Rouge set up shop again in Phnom Penh.should the U.S. worry much about offending China
U.S. diplomacy has done it before, and it will likely do it again
The administration and Congress have lately tangoed around the idea of sending military aid to Cambodia's non-communists.But now the possibility of "diplomatic movement" (Vietnam's withdrawal, the Baker initiative) has put that plan on hold, with the proviso that if the going got rough, the U.S. would then rearm the opposition

Some delays have been caused by a shortage of micoprocessors -- notably Intel Corp. 's newest chip, the 486 -- but others apparently have been caused by Dell's explosive growth and thinly stretched resources

The Orange Workers believe that the solution to South Africa's racial problems isn't the abolition of apartheid, it's the perfection of apartheid -- complete and total separation of the races. Here, then, is where the Orange Workers have come to make apartheid's last stand
This may seem to be a preposterous and utterly futile effort in Africa.And the fact that there are only 3,000 card-carrying Orange Workers may put them on the loony fringe

BankAmerica Corp. reported a 34% jump in third-quarter earnings, as its rocket-like recovery from nearly ruinous losses several years ago continued to be fueled by growth in consumer loans, higher interest margins and negligible loan losses
All but eight of the 850 branches reopened yesterday for business.Automated teller machine operations also were up and operating yesterday
For the first time in nearly two years, BankAmerica results failed to improve in consecutive quarters, but the decline from the second quarter was attributable to special factors
Excluding tax credits, profit was 6% below the second quarter.But that drop was caused entirely by a decline in Brazilian interest paid, to $5 million from $54 million the second quarter
The company cited higher tax credits in the second quarter, totaling $63 million, compared with $28 million in the third quarter.BankAmerica continued to build its reserve against troubled foreign loans by boosting its loan-loss provision to $170 million, about the same as the previous quarter but well above the $100 million in the year-earlier quarter
Moreover, BankAmerica continued to build its reserve against troubled foreign loans by boosting its loan-loss provision to $170 million, about the same as the previous quarter but well above the $100 million in the year-earlier quarter.The provision rate was far above BankAmerica's actual net credit losses of $24 million in the third quarter, compared with $18 million in the second period and $38 million a year earlier.its reserve against troubled foreign-country loans, once below 25%, now amounts to 45% of the $6.4 billion of non-trade debt it calculates it is owed by those nations
Third-quarter profit was 16% below the $304 million, or $1.50 a share, earned in the 1989 second quarter.By any measure, third-quarter earnings were still robust, equivalent to a 0.92% return on assets even excluding tax credits
By that key measure of operating efficiency, BankAmerica turned in a better performance than its well-regarded Los Angeles-based competitor, Security Pacific Corp., which posted a 0.89% return in the third quarter.But it continued to badly trail its San Francisco neighbor, Wells Fargo & Co., which reported an extraordinary 1.25% return on assets

Merkur's death isn't nearly as costly to Ford as was the Edsel debacle, because Merkur was a relatively low-budget project with limited sales goals.Still, Merkur's demise is a setback for Ford at a time when the company's image as the U.S. auto maker with the golden touch is showing signs of strain
The No. 2 auto maker's new Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar models haven't met sales expectations in the year since they were introduced, and Ford's trucks are losing ground to their GM rivals
Merkur was originally aimed at enticing into Lincoln-Mercury dealerships the kind of young, affluent buyers who wouldn't be caught dead in a Town Car -- a vehicle so bargelike that Ford is staging a press event next month linking the Town Car's launch to the commissioning of a new aircraft carrier in Norfolk, Va.

Although the legislation would apply to any acquisition of a major airline, it is aimed at transactions financed by large amounts of debt
It became apparent in hearings that there ought to be regulation of leveraged buy-outs of some sort," Rep. James Oberstar (D., Minn.), chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee, said during the panel's deliberations. "I don't believe in the airline business you can be totally laissez-faire because of the high degree of public interest" at stake. But Mr. Skinner disagreed, calling the legislation "a retreat from the policy of deregulaton of the airline industry

Such authority is more than adequate, say opponents of the legislation.But supporters argue that grounding an airline is so drastic that the department would hesitate doing it
The panel rejected a proposal pushed by AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, to allow the Transportation secretary to block corporate raiders from waging proxy fights to oust boards that oppose a leveraged buy-out.It also voted down proposals to give the secretary much more discretion on whether to block a buy-out and to require the department to consider the impact of a buy-out on workers

Sebastian Guzman Cabrera took over the oil workers union, Mexico's most powerful labor organization, only last January.But even in that short time Mr. Guzman Cabrera has become as controversial in his own way as his deposed predecessor, Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, known as La Quina
In recent contract negotiations with Pemex management, Mr. Guzman Cabrera accepted major concessions that greatly curtail the union's role in subcontracting, long a source of millions of dollars in illicit earnings.And with the quiet pragmatism of Mr. Guzman Cabrera replacing the prickly populism of La Quina, government technocrats have been given a free hand to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment
Since world oil prices collapsed in 1982, the government has siphoned Pemex's coffers to make payments on Mexico's $97 billion foreign debt
While the government drains Pemex from above, the union has drained it from below
I'm the secretary-general, if there is one
Mr. Guzman Cabrera put in more than 40 years at Pemex before being pushed into retirement by La Quina after a dispute two years ago
Though he also long benefited from the system built by La Quina.union perks had simply gotten out of hand

union perks had simply gotten out of hand.in recent contract negotiations, Mr. Guzman Cabrera gave up the union's right to assign 40% of all of Pemex's outside contracts -- an enormous source of kickbacks
Thus, in recent contract negotiations, Mr. Guzman Cabrera gave up the union's right to assign 40% of all of Pemex's outside contracts -- an enormous source of kickbacks.The union also ceded the 2% commission it had received on all Pemex maintenance contracts
Thus, in recent contract negotiations, Mr. Guzman Cabrera gave up the union's right to assign 40% of all of Pemex's outside contracts -- an enormous source of kickbacks.The union also ceded the 2% commission it had received on all Pemex maintenance contracts.The new contract also eliminates the $15 monthly coupon, good only at union-owned grocery stores, that was part of the salary of every worker, from roughneck to chief executive
About 9,800 technical workers, notably chemists and lawyers, were switched to non-union status.Also, because of its reduced capital budget, Pemex has phased out about 50,000 transitory construction workers, reducing the work force to about 140,000
Mr. Guzman Cabrera says the union's sacrifices will be offset by a wage and benefit package that amounts to a 22% increase in compensation. But Pemex managers are the ones most thrilled by the contract
Pemex officials wouldn't say how much money the new contract would save the company, but one previous government estimate pegged savings at around $500 million a year
But Pemex managers are the ones most thrilled by the contract.Pemex's customers also are pleased with the company's new spirit
Grupo Desc, a big conglomerate, has long depended on Pemex petrochemicals to produce plastic packing material.But when the Pemex plant shut down for an annual overhaul, it would never give notice to its customers

In May, the government unveiled new foreign investment regulations that create special trusts allowing foreigners, long limited to a 40% stake in secondary petrochemical companies, to own up to 100%.Later, the government reclassified several basic petrochemicals as secondary products
But Pemex managers are the ones most thrilled by the contract.Pemex's courtship with private companies, and especially foreign ones, is controversial in a country where oil has been a symbol of national sovereignty since foreign oil holdings were nationalized in 1938

UAL fell $6.25 a share to $191.75 on volume of 2.3 million shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange as concern deepened among takeover stock traders about the length of time it will take to revive the purchase
UAL management was to pay $15 million for 10%, and British Air was to receive a 15% stake
The buy-out fell through when Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. unexpectedly failed to obtain bank financing
Although British Air is waiting to see what the buy-out group comes up with, Mr. Stevens said a revised transaction with less debt leverage is likely to be more attractive to banks
the original proposal is dead, and all aspects of a revised version are up for change, in light of the changes in UAL's market price, the amount of debt banks are willing to fund, and the price British Air would be willing to pay
the original offer was "a pretty full price," and that British Air's contribution "was quite a large chunk for us

Although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some purchasers, utilization management -- like most other cost containment strategies -- doesn't appear to have altered the long-term rate of increase in health-care costs
While utilization management frequently reduces hospitalization costs, these savings are often offset by increases in outpatient services and higher administrative costs, according to the report by a panel of health-care experts
that utilization management should have more of an impact as federal research on the effectiveness of medical treatments helps lead to medical practice guidelines

that utilization management will also do a better job of containing costs as it spreads to cover medical services delivered outside of hospitals
There's pretty good evidence that utilization management has reduced inappropriate hospitalization.at the same time, spending on physician services and ambulatory care have mushroomed

First, its position in the government is anomalous Second, the responsibilities of the Federal Reserve as guardian of the currency, which means as guardian of the stability of the price level, sometimes lead it to take measures that are unpopular.the Federal Reserve is an attractive target for complaint by politicians
The Fed is easily assigned the blame for unpleasantness, like high interest rates or slow economic growth, while the politicians can escape responsibility by pointing to the Fed's independence
This leads to proposals for "reform" of the Fed.these proposals do not rest on a view of what the Fed's problem is or, if they do, they rest on an incorrect view
But these proposals do not rest on a view of what the Fed's problem is or, if they do, they rest on an incorrect view

On average, something that cost $100 30 years ago now costs $425.Or, a wage that was $100 30 years ago would buy only $23.53 worth of stuff today
At least, it would not have happened without the support of monetary policy that provided for a 10-fold increase in the money supply during the same period.And that increase in the money supply would not have happened without the consent of the Federal Reserve
if it uses its independence too freely it will lose it
The common proposals for reforming the Fed would only make the situation worse, if they had any effect at all
The secretary is the world's biggest borrower of money.he is a political agent of a political president, who naturally gives extraordinary weight to the way the economy will perform before the next election, and less to its longer-run health
Could he plausibly interpret it as encouragement for the Fed to give primary emphasis to stabilizing the price level?Or would he interpret it as instruction to give more weight to these other objectives that the secretary represents -- low interest rates, short-run economic expansion, and stabilization of exchange rates at internationally managed levels
The Fed's case for its own independence would be a little stronger if it were more solicitous of the independence of the rest of the government
The Fed exercises a power given to it by Congress and the president.But Congress and the president accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power they have given the Fed
To leave this decision to an "independent" agency is not only undemocratic.It also prevents the conduct of a policy that has a long-term rationale
It also prevents the conduct of a policy that has a long-term rationale, because it leaves the Fed guessing about what are the expectations of its masters, the politicians, who have never had to consider the long-term consequences of monetary policy
Legislation to this effect has been introduced in Congress in this session by Rep. Stephen Neal (D., N.C.).It is not the kind of thing that is likely to be enacted, however
Congress would be required to make a hard decision, and Congress would much prefer to leave the hard decision to the Fed and retain its rights of complaint after the fact
People will say that the nation and the government have other objectives, in addition to stabilizing the price level, which is true.But that is not the same as saying that the Federal Reserve has other objectives
The government has other agencies and instruments for pursuing these other objectives.But it has only the Fed to pursue price-level stability
But it has only the Fed to pursue price-level stability.And the Fed has at most very limited ability to contribute to the achievement of other objectives by means other than by stabilizing the price level
The two objectives most commonly thought to be legitimate competitors for the attention of the Fed are high employment and rapid real growth.But the main lesson of economic policy in the past 30 years is that if the Fed compromises with the price-stability objective in the pursuit of these other goals, the result is not high employment and rapid growth but is inflation

The deportation of more than 315,000 men, women and children by the Bulgarian regime adds up to one of the largest migrations seen in the postwar years.Yet some people are advancing a chilling casuistry: that what we are seeing is somehow the understandable result of the historical sins committed by the Turks in the 16th century

As if this weren't enough, the Senate Judiciary Committee is getting into the act
There can be no quibbling that the Armenians endured terrible suffering, but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve
It puts great strain on a longstanding U.S. friendship with Turkey, a country that has been one of America's strongest allies in NATO.The resolution also comes at a time when Turkey has been seeking help from the United States in resolving its Bulgarian emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the European Community
that surfaced when Turkey asked for assistance in dealing with its Bulgarian emigration crisis
when these rationalizations fall on deaf ears that the old standby of retribution for treatment at the hands of the Ottoman Empire comes to the fore
Surely, the past suffering of any people at any time cannot be simply filed away and forgotten.But what the Senate Judiciary Committee has done in supporting the strongly worded Armenian resolution achieves no useful end

No doubt many of his ideas are worthy, but ultimately he is proposing to make fundamentally flawed programs work slightly more fairly and efficiently
Last week, Secretary Kemp ran into a buzzsaw of criticism from House Banking Committee members.They were appalled that he wanted to target more of the $3 billion Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program to low-income projects and zero out the notorious "discretionary" funds that have allowed HUD officials to steer contracts to political cronies

Builders get away with using sand and financiers junk when society decides it's okay, necessary even, to look the other way
Builders get away with using sand and financiers junk when society decides it's okay, necessary even, to look the other way.And by the early 1980s U.S. capitalists had ample reason to welcome junk bonds, to look the other way
By that time they found extremely low profit rates from non-financial corporate investment.Government statistics in fact show that the profit rate -- net pretax profits divided by capital stock -- peaked in 1965 at 17.2%
That same calculation saw profit rates fall to 4.6% in the recession year 1982 and the supposed miracle that followed has seen the profit rate rise only to 8.1% in 1986 and 8% in 1987
in the number arrived at if you divide the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets, the famous Q ratio associated with Prof.James Tobin
In theory, the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same.But of course the market could decide that the firm's capital stock -- its assets -- means nothing if the firm is not producing profits
that the firm's capital stock -- its assets -- means nothing if the firm is not producing profits
But of course the market could decide that the firm's capital stock -- its assets -- means nothing if the firm is not producing profits.This is indeed what the market decided
if it takes only 43 cents to buy a dollar's worth of a firm's capital stock, an alert entrepreneur won't look the other way
that the underlying profitability rate will go up and the capital assets he bought on the cheap will soon be producing profits, thus restoring the market's faith in them
that the underlying profitability rate will go up and the capital assets he bought on the cheap will soon be producing profits, thus restoring the market's faith in them
From the history of capitalism we can take it as a sound bet that if it takes only 43 cents to buy a dollar's worth of a firm's capital stock, an alert entrepreneur won't look the other way.here is where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet, and where society was maybe foolish to look the other way
where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet, and where society was maybe foolish to look the other way
The profit rate is still low and the Q ratio was only 65% in 1987 and 68.9% in 1988
The mounting risks did not go unobserved, even in the mid-1980s.But there were enough promoters announcing the end of history (in this case suspension of normal laws of economic gravity) for society to continue shielding its eyes
Mainstream economists and commentators, craning their necks up at the great pyramids of junk financing, swiveling their heads to watch the avalanche of leveraged buy-outs, claimed the end result would be a leaner, meaner corporate America, with soaring productivity and profits and the weaker gone to the wall.But this is not where the rewards of junk financing were found
Profit rates after the great merger wave are no higher, and now we have an extremely high-interest burden relative to cash flow
From its peak in 1972 of $198.41, the average American weekly wage had fallen to $169.28 in 1987 -- both figures being expressed in 1977 dollars.after the glory boom of the Reagan years, wages had sunk from the post World War II peak by 16% as capitalists, helped by the government, turned down the screws or went offshore

Governments have become sophisticated in handling moments of panic (a word the London Times forbade my father to use when he was reporting the Wall Street crash in 1929).But sophistication has its limits

Even as the stock market has generally done well this year, IBM's shares have slipped steadily from its 52-week high of $130.875
The announcement came after the market's close
The company has spent some $5 billion over the past 3 1/2 years to buy back 42 million common shares, or roughly 7% of those outstanding.despite IBM's well-publicized recent problems, the computer giant still generates enormous amounts of cash
The company has spent some $5 billion over the past 3 1/2 years to buy back 42 million common shares, or roughly 7% of those outstanding. In addition, despite IBM's well-publicized recent problems, the computer giant still generates enormous amounts of cash.As of the end of the second quarter, it had $4.47 billion of cash and marketable securities on hand.some securities analysts had predicted in recent days that IBM would authorize additional purchases
although IBM didn't view its spending as necessarily a way to support the stock, it thought the purchases were a good way to improve such financial measurements as per-share earnings and return on equity
At yesterday's closing price, $1 billion would buy back about 10 million shares, or less than 2% of the roughly 580 million outstanding.as of Sept. 30, the company still had authorization to buy $368 million of stock under a prior repurchase program
In the short term, the move is likely to have little effect.Over the long term IBM's stock repurchases -- along with its hefty, $4.84-a-share annual dividend and generally loyal following among large institutional investors -- are providing a floor for the stock price
Although IBM last year produced its first strong results in four years and was expected to continue to roll this year, it began faltering as early as January

Stock-index arbitrage is the most controversial form of program trading because it accelerates market moves, if not actually causing them.Under the exchange's definitions, program trading also describes a number of other strategies that, in the opinion of some traders, don't cause big swings in the market
Though it collects such data daily, its monthly reports on program trading usually come out about three weeks after each month ends

Ever since that fearful Black Monday, they've been tirelessly wooing wary individual investors -- trying to convince them that Oct. 19, 1987, was a fluke and that the stock market really is a safe place for average Americans to put their hard-earned dollars.

True, the amount of money investors are willing to entrust to their brokers has been growing lately.But those dollars have been going into such "safe" products as money market funds, which don't generate much in the way of commissions for the brokerage firms

From a helicopter a thousand feet above Oakland after the second-deadliest earthquake in U.S. history, a scene of devastation emerges: a freeway crumbled into a concrete sandwich, hoses pumping water into once-fashionable apartments, abandoned autos. But this quake wasn't the big one, the replay of 1906 that has been feared for so many years
The economic life of the region is expected to revive in a day or two, although some transportation problems may last weeks or months
A main factor mitigating more widespread damage was the location of the quake's epicenter -- 20 miles from the heart of the Silicon Valley and more than 50 miles from downtown San Francisco and Oakland.Also, the region's insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage
The tremendous energy of the quake was dissipated by the distance, so that most parts of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage -- broken windows, falling brick and cornices, buckled asphalt or sidewalks
When the tremors struck, the region's largely unseen high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air
nearly all the network's computer switches changed to battery power when the city lost power
The battery packs have enough power for only three hours, but that gave emergency crews time to turn on an emergency system that runs primarily on diesel fuel
That's because the widely used fiber-optic cable has been installed underground with 25 extra feet of cable between junction points
When the tremors struck, the region's largely unseen high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air.Michael L. Bandler, vice president for network technology at Pacific Bell Telephone Co., says nearly all the network's computer switches, which move thousands of calls a minute from one location to another, changed to battery power when the city lost power.The battery packs have enough power for only three hours, but that gave emergency crews time to turn on an emergency system that runs primarily on diesel fuel.Of some 160 switches in Pacific Bell's network, only four went down.One of those was in Hollister, Calif., near the earthquake's epicenter. Few telephone lines snapped.That's because the widely used fiber-optic cable has been installed underground with 25 extra feet of cable between junction points.The slack absorbs the pulling strain generated by an earthquake.phone service was sporadic; many computer terminals remained dark, and by late yesterday a third of San Francisco remained without power
Nevertheless, phone service was sporadic; many computer terminals remained dark, and by late yesterday a third of San Francisco remained without power

Ironically, the long-term effect of the earthquake may be to bolster the Bay area's economic fortunes and, indeed, the nation's gross national product.It may also lead to new safeguards in major construction projects such as double-deck highways
It would in the near-term give a boost to the San Francisco economy because there will be an influx of people to help
There's nothing positive about an earthquake, but it will probably generate more construction activity
Obviously with an earthquake of this size, there are likely to be construction projects that wouldn't have been anticipated
by bidding up stocks of construction and related companies.any increase isn't likely to be any kind of a surge
The earthquake is likely to reduce GNP negligibly in the near term and then could raise it a bit as rebuilding begins

the damage totals in Hurricane Hugo increased tenfold as more information was received
The earthquake damage, of course, would have been far greater if the epicenter had been in downtown San Francisco
that it is far too soon for reliable estimates of the quake's total damage, but it's clear that insurers are likely to pay out enormous sums
Fireman's Fund will probably pay hundreds of millions in primary claims, but, after taxes and use of its reinsurance lines, the company's fourthquarter charge against earnings shouldn't top $50 million
The company was able to assess its damage liability quickly because it has computerized maps of Northern California showing the exact locations of all the property it insures
In addition to paying for earthquake and fire damage.many Californians may not have adequate insurance coverage to pay for damages to their property
A somewhat higher percentage of people living in the Bay area have bought the additional insurance protection, but the great majority aren't covered
of the 250 people thought to have died here.About 20 other deaths were also attributed to the earthquake
The heart of the earthquake, 6.9 on the Richter scale, was 50 miles to the south, near Santa Cruz, but its terrible fist struck here on the Nimitz Freeway, a major artery serving the Bay Bridge between Oakland and San Francisco
Along the way, the quake toppled a mall in Santa Cruz, knocked down buildings in San Francisco's fashionable Marina District and sent a wall of bricks crashing on motorists in the city's Financial District. Just a short span across the bay to the west, the quake also showed its mettle
Many of the buildings, mostly condominiums and apartments, were flattened almost instantly as the underlying soil -- much of it landfill -- was literally turned to ooze by the quake's intensive shaking, rupturing gas lines
three persons died when one of the buildings exploded into a fireball shortly after the quake struck

Efforts to fight the blaze were hampered because water mains were severed as well

East Germany, it is clear, is no Poland, where the Communist Party now shares power with the democratically elected Solidarity union.Nor is it a Hungary, where yesterday the parliament approved constitutional changes meant to help turn the Communist nation into a multiparty democracy. Still, any change in East Germany has enormous implications, for both East and West
Mr. Krenz, 52, was named the new party chief.the Party's 163-member Central Committee convened in East Berlin
Although the East German news agency ADN claimed Mr. Honecker had asked to be relieved of his duties for "health reasons," West German government sources said the 26-man Politburo had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late Tuesday
Mr.Honecker was twice hospitalized this summer for a gall bladder ailment and his physical condition has been the subject of intense speculation in the Western media
East Germany yesterday removed Erich Honecker, one of the staunchest holdouts against the reform rumbling through the Communist world, in an effort to win back the confidence of its increasingly rebellious citizens.Mr. Honecker, a hard-line Stalinist who in 1961 supervised the construction of the Berlin Wall, also was relieved of his title as head of state and his position as chief of the military
to be formally named to all three positions once the nation's parliament convenes later this week
His grip on power unraveled this summer as thousands of his countrymen, dissatisfied by the harshness of his rule, fled to the West
The official line was to offer warmer ties to Mr. Krenz, provided he is willing to institute reforms.But U.S. officials have strong doubts that he is a reformer
I don't think so.Because Mr. Krenz has been very much in accord with the policies of Honecker
There is no clear-cut champion of reform, that we know of, in the East German leadership.Mr. Krenz said on East German television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups
while dialogue is important, enough forums already exist "in which different interests" can express themselves
According to West German government sources, Mr. Honecker and several senior Politburo members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change.But, with public demonstrations in the country growing in size and intensity, Mr. Honecker and several key allies lost out in this battle

Moreover, both men have hewn to a similar hard-line philosophy.However, Mr. Krenz also has a reputation for being politically savvy
His shrewd ability to read the shifting popular mood in East Germany is best illustrated by his apparent break with his old mentor, Mr. Honecker.Indeed, according to West German government sources, he was one of the leaders in the power struggle that toppled Mr. Honecker
Besides sacking other senior Politburo officials who allied themselves with Mr. Honecker, Mr. Krenz could loosen controls on the news media, free up travel restrictions, and establish a dialogue with various dissident groups
As part of his image polishing, Mr. Krenz is expected to take modest steps toward reform to rebuild confidence among the people and reassert the party's authority.Besides sacking other senior Politburo officials who allied themselves with Mr. Honecker, Mr. Krenz could loosen controls on the news media, free up travel restrictions, and establish a dialogue with various dissident groups. But will it be enough
He doesn't signify what people want, so the unrest will go on
Not just that people are being heard but that their interests are being taken seriously
West German government officials and Western analysts are doubtful. "He doesn't signify what people want, so the unrest will go on," Mr. Oldenburg predicts. At the same time, the expectations of the East German people are great and will continue to grow.Chancellor Kohl has invited Mr. Krenz to open discussions with Bonn on a wide range of subjects
Adding to that speculation is Mr. Krenz's reputation as a heavy drinker.to also suffer from diabetes
This is a dynamic process and we're experiencing the first step
Reports in the West German press, citing sources in East Germany, suggest Mr. Krenz may serve only as a bridge between Mr. Honecker and a genuine reform leader.The selection of Mr. Krenz may also disappoint Moscow
If Mr. Krenz sticks to rigid policies the pressure from the Soviet Union could intensify

Erasing the differences still dividing Europe, and the vast international reordering that implies, won't endanger the statehood of a Poland or a Hungary.But it could ultimately lead to German reunification and the disappearance of East Germany from the map

Their proclaimed purpose is to cleanse East Germany of its Stalinist muck, not to merge with the West.the man Mr. Krenz replaces has left an indelible mark on East German society
Imprisoned by the Nazis during World War II for his political beliefs, Mr. Honecker typified the postwar generation of committed Communist leaders in Eastern Europe who took their cues from Moscow. He was a "socialist warrior" who felt rankled by West Germany's enormous postwar prosperity and the Bonn government's steadfast refusal to recognize the legitimacy of his state.Finally, during his first and only state visit to Bonn two years ago, he won some measure of the recognition he had long sought

Mr. Steinhardt, who runs about $1.7 billion for Steinhardt Partners, made his name as a gunslinging trader, moving in and out of stocks with agility -- enriching himself and his investment clients.Meanwhile, his big losses, for instance in 1987's crash, generally have been trading losses. So, some see a special irony in the fact that Mr. Steinhardt, the trader, now is encumbered with a massive, illiquid airline holding
USAir stock might lose four or five points if the Steinhardt stake was dumped all at once
USAir stock might lose four or five points if the Steinhardt stake was dumped all at once.Mr. Steinhardt must reconcile himself to selling USAir at a loss, or to holding the shares as an old-fashioned investment
He doesn't usually risk that much unless he thinks he has an ace in the hole
In recent days USAir has been buying its own shares, as part of a program to retire about eight million USAir shares, though the carrier won't discuss its buy-back program
If USAir stepped up its share purchases, that might be a way for Mr. Steinhardt to get out
If USAir stepped up its share purchases, that might be a way for Mr. Steinhardt to get out.USAir might not want to help Mr. Steinhardt
In 1987, USAir Chairman Edwin Colodny stonewalled when Trans World Airlines Chairman Carl Icahn threatened to take over the carrier
Mr. Icahn, a much more practiced raider than Mr. Steinhardt, eventually sold a big USAir stake at a tiny profit through Bear, Stearns.Mr. Steinhardt also could take that route
Mr. Steinhardt also could take that route.with airline stocks cratering, he might not get a very good price for his shares
While USAir isn't considered absolutely takeover-proof, its defenses, including the sale in August of a 12% stake in the company to Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, are pretty strong
Since last April, the investor has made seven so-called 13D filings in USAir, as he bought and sold the company's stock
Such disclosures of big holdings often are used by raiders to try to scare a company's managers, and to stir interest in the stock.But of course it would be highly unusual for an investment fund such as Steinhardt Partners to take over a company
traders should buy the stock if it tumbles to 35
Analysts say USAir has great promise.meanwhile, USAir is expected to show losses or lackluster profit for several quarters as it tries to digest Piedmont Airlines, which it acquired

That was the question structural engineers and California transportation officials were asking themselves yesterday as rescue workers began the gruesome task of trying to extract as many as 250 victims from beneath the concrete slabs of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland
After touring the area, California Gov. George Deukmejian late yesterday called for an inquiry into the freeway's collapse, blaming the disaster on substandard construction
The impact of the destruction of this 2.5-mile stretch of highway was tragically measured in lost lives.But there are other long-term effects that raise serious questions about the ability of California's infrastructure to withstand a major temblor
It could easily be two years before the well-traveled artery that helps connect Oakland with San Francisco is reopened
It could easily be two years before the well-traveled artery that helps connect Oakland with San Francisco is reopened, and the cost to build a new stretch of highway could soar to more than $250 million
The aftershocks of the highway tragedy are reverberating in Los Angeles as well, as local politicians spoke yesterday against plans to bring double-decking to Los Angeles freeways by 1994
Caltrans abandoned double-decking in the early 1970s, following the 1971 Sylmar earthquake that destroyed freeway sections just north of Los Angeles, Mr. O'Connell explained.why even consider stacking freeways now
We've run out of places to build freeways in L.A., and the only place to go is up
and the only place to go is up.there are many obstacles, including cost
there are many obstacles, including cost.But as for safety, he says double-deck freeways built today with the heavily reinforced concrete and thicker columns required after the Sylmar quake should withstand a calamitous temblor of 7.5 to 8 on the Richter scale
Reasons for the collapse of the Nimitz Freeway were sketchy yesterday.But most structural engineers attributed the destruction to improper reinforcement of the columns that supported the decks, and the fact that the ground beneath the highway is largely landfill and can become unstable, or "liquefy," in a major quake
While the pillars did have long metal bars running vertically through them for reinforcement, they apparently lacked an adequate number of metal "ties" that run horizontally through the column
Caltrans today uses a variation of the design Mr. Parker describes, with spiraling steel rods inside. But in the case of the Nimitz Freeway, the lack of such support caused the core of the columns to crumble and buckle under the weight of the second deck, crushing motorists who were lined up in bumper-to-bumper rush-hour traffic on the lower deck nearly 15 feet below
Basically, we had a severe earthquake of significant duration and it was just something the structure couldn't withstand
Ironically, Caltrans this year began working on a second round of seismic reinforcements of freeways around the state, this time wrapping freeway columns in "steel blankets" to reinforce them.But only bridges supported with single rows of columns were top priority, and the Nimitz Freeway, supported by double rows, was left out

when great confirmation hearings turn on the nominee's response to these great cases they make bad judicial history
While the book amply justifies its subtitle, the title itself is dubious
Perhaps because they won, Mr. Bork's attackers come through more vividly than his defenders
Harvard's Laurence Tribe was the constitutional heavy, laying out legal strategies for the senators and witnesses to follow.But it was Ted Kennedy who scored most effectively with his searing portrayal of "Robert Bork's America" -- the parade of imaginary horribles that would follow logically, he claimed, from the positions Mr. Bork had taken over the space of two decades
that Mr. Bork was willing to stretch the Constitution in one area (free speech) while remaining rigid in all the others
Given Democratic frustration with the Reagan victories and Court appointments, the contingency plans in place, and Mr. Bork's paper trail of vulnerable writings, it was pretty clear that Judge Bork never stood much chance of being confirmed.The nomination still might have been salvaged if a number of Democratic moderates in the South and Southwest had broken party lines

The nomination still might have been salvaged if a number of Democratic moderates in the South and Southwest had broken party lines.But Democratic Sen. Bennett Johnson of Louisiana reminded the little band that anti-Bork blacks and women could furnish the margin to punish them in their next Senate elections
Mr. Bork's opponents chose the battlefield, held it and kept it.Yet with the smooth confirmation of Anthony Kennedy, an "80 percenter" only slightly less supportive of judicial restraint than Mr. Bork, the Democrats may have won the battle but lost the war
Mr. Bork's opponents chose the battlefield, held it and kept it.Another upshot was the chilling message the Bork hearings sent into the judicial culture from which the Supreme Court draws its talent
he would have found a long history going back to the great decisions of Justice Holmes.He would discover it also in Alexander Bickel, a subtle constitutional scholar, Mr. Bork's closest friend at Yale
Probing more deeply into the doctrine of "judicial restraint," he would have found a long history going back to the great decisions of Justice Holmes.He would discover it also in Alexander Bickel, a subtle constitutional scholar, Mr. Bork's closest friend at Yale, whose influence on the judge goes well beyond Mr. Bronner's reporting. Still, the long view of Robert Bork as constitutional thinker must be a spotty one
that must be settled judicially if it is to cohere
that the new right to privacy will become intolerably stretched, though a Supreme Court composed of men and women with realism, guts and a sense of limits should be able to manage it
if Americans allow another happening like the degrading Bork confirmation circus, it will be at their peril

Normally, Sotheby's would have earned 20% of the total in commissions.the auction house opted to forgo that percentage in order to obtain the collection and in exchange for taking a bigger chunk of proceeds exceeding $100 million
while auction houses occasionally guarantee the seller of a highly desirable work of art a minimum price, a financial commitment of this size is unprecedented
Diana D. Brooks, president of Sotheby's North America division, vehemently denies it offered the Dorrance heirs a money-back guarantee.Buried in the glossy hardbound catalog for the sale appears the statement, "Sotheby's has an interest in the property in this catalog

Collectors who have made their money on Wall Street have become an increasingly important part of the art business and their money has helped fuel the art boom, but recently it appears Sotheby's has been returning the compliment
In November 1987, Sotheby's essentially offered a Wall Street-style "bridge loan" of about $27 million to Australian businessman Alan Bond to enable him to purchase Vincent van Gogh's "Irises" for $53.9 million.It was the highest bid in history for a work of art.But two weeks ago, Sotheby's said that it has the painting under lock and key because the loan had not been fully repaid

The Dorrance family will still receive a substantial portion of the auction proceeds above $100 million.it's likely that Sotheby's will take a higher than usual commission on the amount exceeding the guarantee

Egon Krenz, the man tapped yesterday to become East Germany's new leader, faces the same task that has fallen to neighboring socialist colleagues: reforming a country in crisis.But unlike the other new leaders in the East Bloc, Mr. Krenz will face an immediate threat to his nation's very existence: German reunification
Even if he were to change his stripes and become another Milton Friedman, however, he would still stand a good chance of losing a country
Mr. Krenz, age 52, is known as an old-guard ironfist, one likely to continue the method of running a country that the Berlin Wall made famous.Even if he were to change his stripes and become another Milton Friedman he would still stand a good chance of losing a country
Faced with another Mr. Honecker, so many despairing East Germans are likely to flee that the two German peoples will get their reunification, de facto, on West German ground.But if East Germany's arthritic Politburo does loosen up enough to permit Mr. Krenz to make serious efforts at reform, he will face a challenge just as fundamental

Of course East Germany, true to its tradition, could tighten its borders yet further.with world-wide opinion -- even, apparently in Moscow -- against East Germany, the country would have to turn itself into an Albania to clamp down further on refugees
There have been some reports that Mr. Krenz is moving to "soften" his reputation, notably rumors that it was he who kept East Germany's state police off protesters' backs at the country's dismal 40th anniversary celebrations earlier this month.But even if he effects a Hyde-to-Jekyll transformation, he will face a serious ideological crisis and Reunification Scenario Two

Helmut Kohl's governing conservative coalition is proving admirably true to the West German constitution by making more than 500,000 people of German descent automatic citizens this year alone.But within the government and in the think tanks outside it, many West Germans maintain that they don't want immediate reunification
Politically, this currently is wisdom -- particularly given a nervous neighboring France.But it would be ironic if Germany's reunification, just like its division, eventually were the result of actions in centers of power other than Bonn and Berlin

Isn't it reasonable to assume that the asset you own would be worth more if the government suddenly announced that if you sold it, you would be able to keep 30% more of its gain than you previously believed?Indeed, the stock market's steady advance this year tracked with President Bush's success in advancing his capital-gains proposal

Mr. Rahn was pointing out an elephant rumbling through Wall Street while conventional wisdom had fastened on the UAL flea
who sympathize with the view that a capital-gains tax cut benefits the rich.Yet they somehow think that Wall Street is indifferent to losing the tax cut
It would inevitably lead to an increase in marginal income-tax rates in 1990.the White House is forced to ask for higher taxes to meet budget targets
That is, with capital gains cut, the glue of the 1986 accord will be gone, and political realities will push up income-tax rates
if he and his fellow Democrats are successful in killing the president's proposal, the revenue gap will open up tremendously in 1990 because of the weakened economy
If Sen. Bradley would permit a vote on capital gains, though, it would pass, Christmas retail sales would be strong instead of burdened by a falling stock market, the 1990 economy would be robust, and the revenue gains at every level of government, including New Jersey's, would be surprisingly high

by purchasing a stock and buying a put option on that stock
Because a put option gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell a fixed number of shares of the stock at a stated price on or before the option's expiration date, the investor is protected against a sudden drop in the stock's price

You always want your house insured, but you don't always feel the need for your investments to be insured
If the stock goes up in price between now and the put's expiration date, the put will probably expire worthless
The investor will be out the cost of the put, which is called the "premium," and this loss will reduce the stock-market profit
If the stock stays at the same price between now and the put's expiration date, the investor's loss will be limited to the cost of the put, less any amount realized from a closing sale of the put
If the price of the stock declines, the put will increase in value
Once the stock price is less than the exercise price, or "strike price," of the put, the gain will match the loss on the stock dollar for dollar

There are more than 650 stocks on which options may be bought and sold, including some over-the-counter stocks.But some investors might prefer a simpler strategy then hedging their individual holdings
They can do this by purchasing "index puts," which are simply put options on indexes that match broad baskets of stocks.the most popular index option is the S&P 100 option, commonly called the OEX
Unlike options on individual issues, index options are settled only in cash, and no stock is ever tendered

For one thing, an investor's portfolio might not closely match the S&P 100.As a result, the OEX insurance may or may not fully protect an investor's holdings in the event of a market decline.OEX options were suspended from trading last Friday afternoon, after the stock-market sell-off got under way and trading in the S&P-500 futures contract was halted.So an investor who wanted to realize a profit on OEX puts after the trading suspension would have been out of luck

Ultimately, whether the insurance provided by purchasing puts is worthwhile depends on the cost of the options.That cost rises in times of high market volatility.But it still might be cheaper than taking a major hit
A call option is similar to a put, except that it gives its owner the right to buy shares at a stated price until expiration
That's because it reduces the cost of the stock by the amount of premium received from the sale of the call
Selling a call option gives an investor a small buffer against a stock-market decline.if the price of the stock rises above the strike price of the option, the stock is almost certain to be called away.And in that case, the investor misses out on any major upside gain

Hopes for quick enactment of pending deficit-reduction legislation faded as efforts to streamline the House version in advance of a House-Senate conference broke down

House leaders had hoped to follow the Senate's lead by getting an agreement from House committee chairmen under which they would drop items that wouldn't reduce the fiscal 1990 budget deficit from the House-passed bill before the negotiations with the Senate began. But the effort became snagged on the question of what would become of other issues, ranging from cutting the capital-gains tax to child care to repeal of catastrophic-illness insurance

The trade report drew yet another unsettling parallel to October 1987.In 1987 the news was the latest in a string of disappointments on trade
In 1987, however, the news was the latest in a string of disappointments on trade, while the current report comes after a period of improvement
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher called the worsening trade figures "disappointing after two very good months." And White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the deficit was "an unwelcome increase," adding that "we're hopeful that it simply is a one-month situation and will turn around
The bleak trade report was played down by the Bush administration.the figures reinforced the view of many private analysts that the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit has run out of steam
that the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit has essentially stalled out at a level of about a $110 billion annual rate.That's still an improvement over last year
That's still an improvement over last year, but it leads one to conclude that basically we've gotten all the mileage we can out of past dollar depreciation and past marginal cuts in the federal budget deficit
Exports declined for the second consecutive month in August, slipping 0.2% to $30.41 billion.Imports leaped 6.4% to a record $41.18 billion
Not only was August's deficit far worse than July's, but the government revised the July figure substantially from the $7.58 billion deficit it had initially reported last month
that deep cuts in the U.S. budget deficit are needed before further trade improvement can occur
That's because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign capital, overwhelming the nation's capacity to export
People are sick and tired of hearing about these deficits, but the imbalances are still there and they are still a problem

In the two weeks since the rebellion, which the U.S. hesitantly backed, Mr. Noriega has been at his most brutal-and efficient-in maintaining power.it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr. Noriega and Washington that stretches back three decades
Before American foreign policy set out to destroy Noriega, it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama's long history of conspirators and pirates
For most of the past 30 years, the marriage was one of convenience.In 1960 when Mr. Noriega was both a cadet at an elite military academy in Peru and a spy-in-training for the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, he was detained by Lima authorities for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute, according to a U.S. Embassy cable from that period.The woman had nearly died.But U.S. intelligence, rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy, merely filed the report away

The U.S. has befriended and later turned against many dictators, but none quite so resourceful
The 55-year-old Mr. Noriega isn't as smooth as the shah of Iran, as well-born as Nicaragua's Anastasio Somoza, as imperial as Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines or as bloody as Haiti's Baby Doc Duvalier.Yet he has proved more resilient than any of them

Mr. Noriega might have fallen of his own weight in 1988 because of Panama's dire economic situation.increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression, and a scapegoat for his own mismanagement

And the investigators were quickly closing in on Mr. Noriega himself. At the time, though, in 1979, the U.S. was once again flirting with its longtime Latin American spy

Their original indictment against Mr. Wittgreen, the friend of Mr. Noriega, and the other four was dismissed on a technicality.But now, along with reindicting Mr. Noriega's pal, they intended to charge Mr. Noriega himself, on allegations that he was involved in the illegal trading of some $2 million in arms

Soon, the military became a veritable mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses.The Reagan administration also put Mr. Noriega's G-2 back on the U.S. payroll

Lung-cancer mortality rates for people under 45 years of age have begun to decline, federal researchers report.A report in this week's issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute also projects that overall U.S. mortality rates from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death, should begin to drop in several years if cigarette smoking continues to abate
that overall U.S. mortality rates from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death, should begin to drop in several years if cigarette smoking continues to abate
which comes.the U.S. Surgeon General issued a report warning against the dangers of smoking
The death rate from lung cancer of white males aged 35 to 44 in the mid-1970s was 13.4 per 100,000, but the mortality rate of the same age group in the mid-1980s was 9.6, a decline of 28.7%
The report is the strongest indication to date that the reduction in smoking is leading to lower death rates from lung cancer.The study, by Susan Devesa, William Blot and Joseph Fraumeni of the institute's staff, also shows that the incidence of lung cancer as well as the death rate declined over the decade for all groups in the 35-44 age bracket, except black men
Although lung-cancer mortality rates are increasing for the nation as a whole, the report projects that death rates will begin to decline in the 1990s for men and after the year 2000 for women
Lung-cancer mortality rates increase with age and are continuing to rise for all age groups over 55, with sharp increases for everybody but white men.the declining rates we're seeing for younger people may be a harbinger of declining mortality in the future

While nearly equal percentages of black and white women currently smoke, in both sexes more whites have given up smoking than blacks

The government currently is subsidizing an estimated 23,000 loans above 11% under the 235 program, and however disruptive to private investors, the refinancing is expected to yield at least $15 million in savings in fiscal 1990
This sum has been guarded jealously by appropriators anxious to offset spending elsewhere, and conservative Sen. Phil Gramm cast the fight as a populist stand against monied interests
The action came as the administration won final congressional approval of $9 million in assistance for elections scheduled in Nicaragua in February
The bulk of the money would be funneled through the National Endowment for Democracy, but the legislation is so vaguely written that it has been dogged by questions regarding the money's true purpose and its ultimate destination
The Senate had refused late Friday to invoke cloture and limit debate, but behind the bipartisan leadership, a solid majority took shape yesterday and brushed aside amendments seeking to cut the total package or steer it away from direct aid to political parties
Final approval -- on a 64-35 roll call -- was never in doubt, but the opposition drew an unusual mix of senators, including Republicans Jesse Helms and Warren Rudman and Democrats Bill Bradley and John Glenn
The money will be applied for voter registration and election monitoring, but more than half is likely to go to the Union Nacional Opositora party
such cash contributions may only undercut the opposition party's standing, and one irony is that under Nicaraguan law a major portion of the opposition party's funds must be shared with the government's Supreme Electoral Council
The decision to raise the ceiling on FHA home loans still faces strong opposition in the House.But it is driven by the same fiscal pressures that have forced lawmakers to resort to various bookkeeping devices to juggle as much as $1 billion in spending that would otherwise put the bill over budget
to juggle as much as $1 billion in spending that would put the bill over budget
These costs will complicate the budget picture in fiscal 1991, and the measure further commits Congress to a set of costly projects, including the first construction funds for the space station
The station is promised $1.8 billion within the $5.36 billion provided for research and development in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the nation's high-speed aerospace plane could receive as much as $60 million in new funds or transfers

An estimated $1.57 billion is separately allocated for the National Science Foundation, and within the Housing and Urban Development Department, more than $9.2 billion is provided for federally assisted housing, including an expanded effort to modernize public housing units that serve the poorest families
While the practice was discouraged in the past, the conference agreement is laced with veterans' hospitals, environmental projects and urban grants designated for specific communities
where the two houses had separately approved a total of 27 projects valued at $20 million, and the conference added 15 more valued at $8 million to ostensibly preserve "balance" between the House and Senate
Yesterday's conference agreement is the second major bill to emerge from negotiations this week, as appropriators approved a fiscal 1990 transportation bill late Monday that includes a sweeping ban on smoking on most domestic airline flights

When the Soviets announced their last soldier had left Afghanistan in February, the voices of skepticism were all but drowned out by an international chorus of euphoria

a Soviet-controlled regime remains in Kabul, the refugees sit in their camps, and the restoration of Afghan freedom seems as far off as ever
Those who bought that illusion are now bewildered.there never was a chance that the Afghan resistance would overthrow the Kabul regime quickly and easily
The terms of the Geneva accords leave Moscow free to provide its clients in Kabul with assistance of any kind -- including the return of Soviet ground forces -- while requiring the U.S. and Pakistan to cut off aid
that U.S. aid to the resistance would continue as long as Soviet aid to Kabul did
The only fly in the Soviet ointment was the last-minute addition of a unilateral American caveat, that U.S. aid to the resistance would continue as long as Soviet aid to Kabul did.But as soon as the accords were signed, American officials sharply reduced aid

Since the troop withdrawal, Moscow has poured in an additional $200 to $300 million worth per month -- nearly $2 billion since February, equivalent to the total U.S. aid to the resistance in nine years.By early May, Moscow had delivered 1,000 trucks, about 100 tanks, artillery and hundreds of other combat vehicles

a Soviet-controlled regime remains in Kabul, the refugees sit in their camps, and the restoration of Afghan freedom seems as far off as ever.the Kabul regime is increasingly successful at portraying the resistance as bloody-minded fanatics
This heavy outside support for the worst has undermined better, moderate leaders. In autumn last year the regime garrison at Kandahar was prepared to surrender the city to resistance moderates.At the last minute, however, Pakistani officials sent in Gulbuddin Hekhmatyar, perhaps the most hated and feared of the extremists, with a demand that the surrender be made to his forces

In 1983, the Supreme Court tried to supply a workable definition in the Dirks v.SEC decision, which found that liability depended on whether the tipper had breached his fiduciary duty to the corporation in order to obtain "some personal gain" and whether the tippee knew or recklessly disregarded this fact. Gradually lower courts and prosecutors have pushed this definition to its breaking point
She called her daughter to take her to the bank, who persuaded her husband, a Mr. Loeb, to run this errand

Essentially, Mr. Freeman had invested heavily in the Beatrice leveraged buy-out, when he was told by another prominent trader, Bernard "Bunny" Lasker, that the deal was in trouble
After placing orders to sell, Mr. Freeman called Martin Siegel, an investment banker at Kidder, Peabody & Co. to confirm these rumors
Was there a fiduciary breach in order to obtain personal gain?Did Mr. Freeman have notice of this?Finally, was the information material
Had the case gone to trial the same issues would have surfaced.all these issues are subsidiary to a more central issue
It is not my contention that either Mr. Chestman or Mr. Freeman was an innocent victim of prosecutorial overzealousness.Arguably, both were on notice that their behavior was at least risky.But even if they behaved recklessly, reasons still exist to fear and resist this steady process of case-by-case judicial extension of the law of insider trading

When a court decides that a particular actor's conduct was culpable and so extends the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct, it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that will be covered by the expanded rule
that a particular actor's conduct was culpable and so extends the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct
When a court decides that a particular actor's conduct was culpable and so extends the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct, it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that will be covered by the expanded rule. Thus, a court is poorly positioned to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule
Thus, a court is poorly positioned to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule.in focusing on Mr. Freeman's attempt to gain nonpublic information about a deal's collapse, one does not naturally think about the reverse side of the coin: What if the rumor had been false
In the past, not only would reputable professionals have rushed to check out such rumors with the company, but companies listed on the major stock exchanges were encouraged by the exchanges to respond openly to such inquiries from securities analysts

In 1987, the Supreme Court attempted in McNally v.U.S. to halt the inexorable expansion of these statutes by adopting a rule of strict construction for ambiguous criminal statues.Yet, late last year, Congress effectively reversed this decision by enacting a one-sentence statute that defined fraud to include any scheme to deprive another of "the intangible right of honest services

While the U.S. share of the increase probably will not reach the $12 billion or more implicit in the IMF's request for a doubling of its $90 billion capital, the administration probably will agree to a multibillion-dollar increase
While international politics may argue for the capital increase, there is a clear economic case against it
that the IMF practices central planning while supporting ineffective governments
that the administration give assurances that liberal Democrats' support will not be used against them in congressional re-election campaigns; and that the legislation address -- with dollars -- social and environmental concerns
Because commercial banks and the developing-country governments believe they will get a piece of any capital increase, a scaled-down IMF mission would leave both feeling shortchanged

that it would continue to pursue "other alternatives" to sell the five core companies and that a group of senior executives plans to make a proposal to purchase three of the companies -- Integrated Resources Equity Corp., Resources Trust Co. and Integrated Resources Asset Management Corp
Integrated Resources Inc., the troubled financial-services company that has been trying to sell its core companies to restructure debt, said talks with a potential buyer ended Integrated said that it would continue to pursue "other alternatives" to sell the five core companies and that a group of senior executives plans to make a proposal to purchase three of the companies -- Integrated Resources Equity Corp., Resources Trust Co. and Integrated Resources Asset Management Corp.Integrated also said it expects to report a second-quarter loss wider than the earlier estimate of about $600 million

Los Angeles financier Marvin Davis last night proffered both a ray of hope and an extra element of uncertainty by saying he remains interested in acquiring UAL.But he dropped his earlier $300-a-share back-up bid
Even as Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. scrambled to line up bank financing for a revised version of the lapsed labor-management bid, British Airways, a 15% partner in the buying group, indicated it wants to start from scratch
Although Mr. Wolf and John Pope, UAL's chief financial officer, stood to pocket $114.3 million for stock and options in the buy-out, UAL executives planned to reinvest only $15 million in the new company
Confusion about the two banks' hurried efforts to round up financing for a new bid that the UAL board hasn't even seen yet helped send UAL stock spiraling downward.And rumors of forced selling by takeover-stock traders triggered a 25-point downdraft in the Dow Jones Industrial Average around 11:15 a.m. EDT yesterday
Yesterday's selling began after a Japanese news agency reported that Japanese banks were ready to reject a revised version at around $250 a share, or $5.65 billion
as the day progressed gave vague or conflicting indications about whether banks would sign up
Several reports as the day progressed gave vague or conflicting indications about whether banks would sign up. Citicorp said only that it had "expressions of interest of a transaction from both the borrowers and the banks," but didn't have an agreement
Late in the day, Mr. Wolf issued a onepage statement calling Mr. Peterpaul's blast "divisive and uncalled for." But he gave few details on the progress toward a new bid
that British Airways may balk at any hasty reformulation of the aborted $6.79 billion buy-out of United Airlines' parent.in another sign that a new bid isn't imminent, it was learned that the UAL board held a telephone meeting Monday to hear an update on the situation, but that a formal board meeting isn't likely to be convened until early next week

The pilots were meeting outside Chicago yesterday.But British Air apparently wasn't involved in the second proposal
A group of United's noncontract employees said in a statement, "The fact that Wolf and other officers were going to line their pockets with literally millions of dollars while instituting severe pay cuts on the nonunion employees of United is not only deplorable but inexcusable." The machinists also asked for an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible securities-law violations in the original bid for UAL by Mr. Davis, as well as in the response by UAL
just before the bank commitments were due, the union asked the U.S. Labor Department to study whether the bid violated legal standards of fairness governing employee investment funds
our approach is sound, and that it is far better for all employees than the alternative of having an outsider own the company with employees paying for it just the same
Mr. Wolf has eschewed merger advice from a major Wall Street securities firm, relying instead only on a takeover lawyer, Peter Atkins of Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom
The huge drop in UAL stock prompted one takeover stock trader, George Kellner, managing partner of Kellner, DiLeo & Co., to deny publicly rumors that his firm was going out of business.The stock's decline also has left the UAL board in a quandary
Although it may not be legally obligated to sell the company if the buy-out group can't revive its bid, it may have to explore alternatives if the buyers come back with a bid much lower than the group's original $300-a-share proposal
to sell the company if the buy-out group can't revive its bid

Right away you notice the following things about a Philip Glass concert.if still conscious at the evening's end, you notice something else
if still conscious at the evening's end, you notice something else: The audience, at first entranced and hypnotized by the music, releases its pent-up feelings in collective gratitude
Either one likes it or one doesn't
The typical Glass audience, which is more likely to be composed of music students than their teachers, certainly does. The work, though, sounds like Muzak for spaceships
and his music the new clothes, of the avant-garde
The piano compositions are relentlessly tonal (therefore unthreatening
unvaryingly rhythmic (therefore soporific
and unflaggingly harmonious but unmelodic (therefore both pretty and unconventional
Far from being minimalist, the music unabatingly torments us with apparent novelties not so cleverly disguised in the simplicities of 4/4 time, octave intervals, and ragtime or gospel chord progressions.But the music has its charm
But the music has its charm, and Mr. Glass has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex
Mr. Glass works in the two octaves on either side of middle C, and his fingers seldom leave the keys
The music is not especially pianistic; indeed, it's hard to imagine a bad performance of it
We hear inner voices, but they all seem to be saying the same thing
The chords modulate, but there is little filigree

The Fourth Knee Play," an interlude from "Einstein on the Beach," is like a toccata but it doesn't seem to move much beyond its left-hand ground in "Three Blind Mice

regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines.ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest 25 markets
National Geographic, like other magazines, began offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines.the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions
than did competitors.Time magazine has more than 100 separate editions going to different regions, top management, and other groups
Another sticking point for advertisers was National Geographic's tradition of lumping its ads together, usually at the beginning or end of the magazine, rather than spreading ads out among its articles.National Geographic's smaller-than-average size means extra production costs for advertisers
But the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions.the magazine is fighting back

Traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders

ONE DAY Carl Barrett of Mobile, Ala., was raking some sycamore leaves, but the rake kept riding up over the piles
The harder he tried to push them into large piles, the closer he came to breaking the rake and straining his back. So Mr. Barrett, then vice president of the Alabama Steamship Association, took a steel-toothed garden rake and taped it to the underside of a leaf rake about nine inches up
His crude device worked: The lower teeth gathered the leaves into a pile, while the higher, harder teeth moved the top of the pile.Now incorporated into a polypropylene rake, the four-inch prongs, or "wonderbars," also are supposed to aid in picking up leaves
One customer, Donald Blaggs of Mobile, says the Barrett Rake allowed him to do his lawn in 2 1/2 hours, two hours less than usual. But other rake makers have their doubts
the Barrett rake "makes sense," but it would be "tough" to explain to consumers
They either pick it up.they start pulling from a fresh direction

For one thing, there is an old master on the wall -- "Samuel Anointing David," a big baroque canvas painted by Mattia Preti, a 17th-century Neapolitan. At the moment the painting is a nagging reminder of the problems that have engulfed CenTrust and its flamboyant chairman and chief executive, David L. Paul
that the $28 million was plucked from the funds of this federally insured institution even as CenTrust was losing money hand over fist
Though the agency could remove Mr. Paul, it has no current intention to do that
It's not like selling Chevrolets," Mr. Paul says, as he takes a drag on a goldbanded St. Moritz cigarette
Although Mr. Paul has pared a $1.35 billion junk-bond portfolio to less than $900 million since April, the high-yield debt market has plummeted
Divesting itself of what is left may well prove difficult. And CenTrust has other problems
Mr. Paul has a plan to bring in $150 million by selling off 63 of CenTrust's 71 branches, but it has yet to be approved by regulators
Embittered shareholders (some of whom are suing) say the chairman and his collection epitomize the excesses of speculation that set off the national S&L crisis.Gallery directors say Mr. Paul and others of his ilk have left an indelible mark on the art world -- and not for the better
Johnny Payson got $53 million for his, so certainly $10 million isn't too much for mine
The great collectors we depended on, such as Paul Mellon or Norton Simon, have stopped buying, and the new buyers are brilliant men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting
Mr. Bond has yet to pay up, and until he does, Sotheby's has the painting under lock and key
until he does, Sotheby's has the painting under lock and key
When Mr. Paul moved in on the art market, he let it be known that virtually no piece was too costly to be considered by CenTrust
There, on one of his first shopping trips, Mr. Paul picked up several paintings at stunning prices.He paid $2.2 million for a still life by Jan Jansz. den Uyl that was expected to fetch perhaps $700,000

He says he `stole them.he tells me, `If you want to see your paintings, you'll have to come to my house in Florida
Mr. Paul quickly became more aggressive in his collecting, with the help of George Wachter, a Sotheby's expert in old masters.according to one dealer, Mr. Wachter had a penchant for introducing Mr. Paul with the phrase: "He can buy anything
People were interested in seeing him, but it was recognized that the route was through Sotheby's and particularly George Wachter
Mr. Paul "was known to spend a lot of money.People were interested in seeing him, but it was recognized that the route was through Sotheby's and particularly George Wachter." Mr. Paul thus developed a close, symbiotic relationship with Sotheby's
to stir up interest in old masters as it strove to build its U.S. business
that he doesn't stop at paint on canvas but also spends big on art you can eat

that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at Sotheby's
that he was "merely storing the paintings at home -- with some display -- because of the special dehumidified environment" required for their safekeeping, until CenTrust's new building was ready for them
He explains that he was "merely storing the paintings at home -- with some display -- because of the special dehumidified environment" required for their safekeeping, until CenTrust's new building was ready for them.Still, the incident was embarrassing
that Mr. Paul has benefited handsomely from his association with CenTrust.he got a $3 million loan from the S&L, negotiated at a below-market rate
that he, relying rather too heavily on Sotheby's advice, paid much too much for several pieces in the CenTrust collection.The $12 million lavished on the Rubens was a record price for the artist and maybe twice its value, given a dispute among scholars about its provenance
scholars question the authenticity of the Rubens.It may have been painted instead by a Rubens associate
that Mr. Paul paid very dearly for the Rubens and adds that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a feat
It's not beyond credibility the Rubens will someday be worth $12 million, but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow remains to be seen
that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a feat.predicting is tricky
Art prices are skyrocketing, but a good deal of legerdemain is involved in compiling statistics on sales
Salomon Brothers Inc., the investment-banking firm, in its annual tally of investment returns, reported that old masters appreciated 51% in the year ended June 1, the greatest return of any of 13 assets it tracked.Salomon gets its data on art appreciation from Sotheby's, whose prices go up with clients like Mr. Paul in its thrall
Art indexes track winners, not losers.But art that has fallen sharply in value is rarely put up for sale
But art that has fallen sharply in value is rarely put up for sale.Also, at any of Sotheby's auctions of old masters, roughly one-third to one-fifth of what is offered doesn't sell at any price
It's not that there aren't any bids, but the bids don't meet the minimum "reserve" prices set by the sellers
In January, the Preti painting that now hangs at CenTrust was expected to bring no more than $700,000 at auction until Mr. Paul came along with his $1.15 million
$1.15 million "would have been an impossible price for anyone to ask for a Preti four years ago.it isn't that Mr. Paul, a customer of his too, overpaid for the work, "a gargantuan painting by an artist who is not a household word
that Mr. Paul, a customer of his too, overpaid for the work, "a gargantuan painting by an artist who is not a household word.It just shows things have changed
that he spotted bargains in old masters.they took an upward turn
They went up 51% last year, and they'll do it again this year
the auction house has been "assisting" Mr. Paul in selling the paintings.a number of {the artworks} have already been sold, and at a substantial profit
That isn't 51%, and the claim isn't documented
that he spotted bargains in old masters just before they took an upward turn.that he relied too heavily on Sotheby's or Mr. Wachter
he had not one but four advisers and that he never bid impulsively
he expects to sell the collection -- including the controversial Rubens -- "carefully and prudently.in art-world parlance, Mr. Paul's holdings are "burnt
That is, he is being compelled to put them on the market too soon.quick turnover in artwork is "like pawning your jewelry -- you end up with 50%
On occasion, he paid a high price.those who bid less and dropped out were dealers who would then have marked up the paintings to resell them at a profit to collectors
who bid less and dropped out.who would then have marked up the paintings to resell them at a profit to collectors
to both advise a client on purchases and to set price estimates on the paintings to be purchased
Frequently, clients express interest in paintings but don't end up bidding.we don't know who the potential buyer will be
that he has feelers out over much of the globe and that potential buyers from as far away as Japan and Italy have examined the collection

a tragicomic monologue by an idealistic, not unheroic, though sadly self-deceived English butler in his sixties -- proceeds as if the realistic English novel of manners, like Britannia herself, still ruled the waves
As the narrator Stevens, the solitary butler of Darlington Hall, mulls over such hallowed terms as "greatness," "dignity," "service" and "loyalty," we see how pious cant subverts the soul
As he stands on a hill at the beginning of a six-day motor expedition from Oxfordshire to Cornwall.Stevens surveys the view
Stevens surveys the view and thereby provides a self-portrait, a credo and the author's metaphor for the aesthetic of the novel we're reading
We call this land of ours Great Britain, and there may be those who believe this a somewhat immodest practice
and there may be those who believe this a somewhat immodest practice.Yet I would venture that the landscape of our country alone would justify the use of this lofty adjective
An effusive landscape?An ill-mannered mountain?But let Stevens continue in his unwitting comic manner
Continentals are unable to be butlers because they are as a breed incapable of the emotional restraint which only the English race are capable of
Despite his racial advantage, to be a great butler is a heroic calling.If in the midst of a great social occasion (such as an international conference on revising the Versailles Treaty in 1923), one's 72-yearold father, himself a great butler once, should happen to die of a stroke, one must continue to serve the port
In the end, after meeting with the former housekeeper

The Irish-Soviet aviation connection is alive and well here at Shannon Airport.GPA is indeed talking about leasing Western planes to Aeroflot and even about buying Soviet-built Tupolev 204s
Unlikely as it may seem, tiny, politically neutral Ireland has penetrated the mighty Soviet airline bureaucracy.the Irish aviation industry seems poised to benefit
as Aeroflot struggles to boost its service standards, upgrade its fleet and pursue commercial opportunities, the Irish aviation industry seems poised to benefit
Irish and Soviet people are similar.Irish companies are small but spunky
Aeroflot carried about 125 million passengers last year, and Shannon Airport, the airline's largest transit airport outside the Soviet Union, saw 1,400 Aeroflot flights and 250,000 passengers pass through
What Aeroflot doesn't pour into its own gas-guzzling Ilyushins is bartered to the airport authority, which resells it to 11 Western carriers including Air France, Trans World Airlines and Pakistan International Airlines.Aeroflot thus pays its landing fees, ground-handling and catering bills with fuel
Duty-free shops in Leningrad's Pulkova Airport opened in July, and hard-currency shops in Leningrad hotels and on the Soviet-Finnish frontier are coming soon
When it opened in 1939, Shannon was the first landfall in Europe for thirsty airplanes flying from North America
Advances in aircraft fuel efficiency over the years made a Shannon stop unnecessary for most Western air fleets, but Aeroflot still flies inefficient Ilyushins that can't make it from Moscow to Managua on one hop

When Nucor Corp. begins shipping steel from the world's first thin-slab plant this month, it will begin testing the competitive mettle of its giant competitors
New, efficient and sophisticated processes make it easier for smaller, less cash-rich companies to make steel at a fraction of what Big Steel paid decades ago.It also enables minimills finally to get a toehold in the flat-rolled steel market -- the major steelmakers' largest, most prized, and until now, untouchable, market

But such thin-slab technology is only the beginning
In fact, they've spent billions of dollars to boost the percentage of continously cast steel to 60.9% in 1988, from 39.6% five years before.Moreover, their balance sheets are rich with diversity, their old plants shuttered, and work forces lean

Because all operations are connected, one equipment failure forces a complete plant shutdown

After letting aluminum-makers take the recycling lead, a group of the nation's largest steelmakers started a recycling institute to promote steel cans to an environmentally conscious nation
steelmakers should concentrate more on construction.Weirton Steel Corp., Weirton, W. Va. is touting to homeowners fashionable steel doors, with leaded glass inserts, as a secure and energy-efficient alternative to wooden or aluminum ones
Now we're figuring out what people need, and are going back to make it.Producers also are trying to differentiate by concentrating on higher-profit output, such as coated and electrogalvanized products
Almost all capital-improvement programs announced by major steelmakers within the past year involve building electrogalvanizing lines.unfortunately, that segment is much smaller than the bread-and-butter flat-rolled steel
Although he doesn't expect any bankruptcies, he does see more plants being sold or closed
Unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar, it's unlikely that consumption of U.S. produced steel will grow sufficiently to offset the growth of minimills
Japanese and European steelmakers, which have led the recent technology developments, are anxiously awaiting the lifting of trade restraints in 1992.Moreover, the U.S. can expect more competition from low-cost producing Pacific Rim and Latin American countries
After 78 days of mind-numbing testimony in federal court in Boston, the trial is being all but ignored by analysts and patent attorneys.Most have read the pre-trial documents, however
That may be the largest patent award ever, but it is well below the $12 billion Polaroid seeks
when Smith International Inc. was ordered to pay $205 million to Baker Hughes Inc. for infringing on a patent on an oil drilling bit seal.The two companies later agreed to settle for $95 million
You might find something, but the chances are low
Few analysts think it is worth their time to slog through the Polaroid trial testimony.Eugene Glazer, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said: "If you hired an attorney to be there all the time and give you a (prediction) of the eventual award, I would be willing to bet that he would be off" by a lot

Carr told Kodak on many occasions to avoid various features because of Polaroid's patent positions," and Kodak followed his advice in every instance

The main issues remaining are how to calculate damages and whether the infringement was "willful and deliberate.Observers also wonder whether Judge Mazzone will use the lost-profits method of determining damages
which Polaroid favors because it would result in a larger award
Polaroid claims it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold by Kodak if Kodak hadn't entered the market.Moreover, Polaroid contends it could have sold them at a higher price -- and thus made higher profits -- because it wouldn't have been forced to match Kodak's lower prices

Options traders were hurt worse than others on Friday because of the highly volatile nature of options, which often rise or fall in value several times the amount of the price change in the individual stock or index of stocks on which they are based.Thus, options traders Friday were stuck with losses that also were several times larger than those suffered by many stock traders in New York

which were substantially above those in the market as it was falling
Options traders were forced on Friday to buy those contracts back at the previously agreed prices, which were substantially above those in the market as it was falling.They then had no choice in many cases but to sell the contracts at prevailing prices -- in most cases at a substantial loss
Making matters worse was the fact that late Friday afternoon the CBOE halted stock-index options trading in step with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's halt in stock-index futures.But while the Merc reopened a half hour later, the CBOE remained closed, leaving many options traders unable to make trades that might have reduced the losses
Exchange officials reasoned that they wouldn't have been able to make such a rotation with the time remaining Friday afternoon, and with the stock-index futures on the verge of closing for a second and final time, the CBOE reasoned that its best course was to remain closed
The damage was so bad at Fossett Corp., an options trading firm here, that it was forced to transfer its accounts to First Options of Chicago, a unit of Continental Bank Corp., as a result of options trading losses.Fossett still had several million dollars in capital left after Friday's close of trading, but not enough that regulators, worried about another potential market plunge yesterday, would let it reopen for trading
Fossett still had several million dollars in capital left after Friday's close of trading, but not enough that regulators, worried about another potential market plunge yesterday, would let it reopen for trading.in an unprecedented arrangement underscoring the seriousness of the transfer, the CBOE, the American Stock Exchange and the Options Clearing Corp., as well as the firm's owner, Stephen Fossett, put up a total of $50 million to guarantee the customer positions being transferred to the bank holding company subsidiary in case the market plunged again yesterday

Mr. Stevens declined to give the specific contributions to the $50 million guarantee from each participant.But CBOE and Amex officials said that Options Clearing Corp. contributed $20 million to the guarantee, the CBOE put up $8 million, the Amex added $4 million and $18 million came from Mr. Fossett's own assets

The syndicate, led by Schroders Asia Ltd., agreed last November to provide the loan to Asia Development Corp., a U.S. property developer.But several weeks ago, in the wake of the Beijing killings, the loan was canceled, according to bankers and executives close to the project
Lenders had doubts about the project even before June 4, but the harsh crackdown gave the banks the out they wanted
When the loan agreement was announced, it was hailed as one of the first Western-style financing transactions ever used in China
Unlike most loans to China, there was no Chinese guarantor.Instead, the banks secured a promise from state-owned Bank of Communications that it would lend Asia Development the entire $55 million at maturity to finance repayment of the original borrowing

Separately, bankers representing the group trying to buy United's parent UAL Corp. met with other banks about reviving that purchase at a lower price, possibly around $250 a share, or $5.65 billion.But a lower bid could face rejection by the UAL board
The Manhattan real-estate developer acted after the UAL buyers failed to obtain financing for their earlier $300-a-share bid
whose shares never reopened after trading was halted Friday for the UAL announcement

that showed signs of stalling.problems emerged with the UAL deal
After reaching an intraday high of $107.50 the day Mr. Trump disclosed his bid Oct. 5, AMR's stock had retreated as low as $97.75 last week
Some takeover stock traders had been betting against Mr. Trump because he has a record of disclosing stakes in companies that are potential takeover targets, then selling at a profit without making a bid
Mr. Trump withdrew his bid before the AMR board ever formally considered it
AMR had weighed a wide range of possible responses, from flat rejection to recapitalizations and leveraged buy-outs that might have included either employees, a friendlier buyer such as Texas billionaire Robert Bass, or both. AMR had also sought to foil Mr. Trump in Congress by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the Transportation Department to reject airline buy-outs
AMR declined to comment, and Mr. Trump didn't respond to requests for interviews
to notify the market before selling any shares
he didn't sell before his announcement reached the market
Some analysts said AMR Chairman Robert Crandall might seize the opportunity presented by the stock price drop to protect the nation's largest airline with a defensive transaction, such as the sale of stock to a friendly holder or company employees.However, other knowledgeable observers said they believed Mr. Crandall and the AMR board might well decide to tough it out without taking any extra steps
they believed Mr. Trump might come back with a lower bid.others remained skeptical
he was dropping it "in light of the recent change in market conditions." He said he might now sell his AMR stake, buy more shares, or make another offer at a lower price.Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp., the two lead lenders on the UAL buy-out, met with other banks yesterday to determine if they would be willing to finance the buy-out at a lower price

The first UAL deal unraveled after Citibank and Chase couldn't raise $7.2 billion
Citibank and Chase had agreed to commit $3 billion, and said they were "highly confident" of raising another $4.2 billion
Together, Citicorp and Chase received $8 million in fees to raise the rest of the financing.But other banks balked at the low interest rate and banking fees the UAL group was willing to pay them
but isn't likely to boost its $965 million equity contribution. Nor is the group likely to come forward with a revised offer within the next 48 hours despite the hopes of many traders
UAL's board could reject the new price as too low, especially since there aren't any competing bids.the coalition of labor and management, longtime enemies who joined forces only under the threat of Mr. Davis's bid, could break apart now
