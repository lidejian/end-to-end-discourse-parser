Solo woodwind players have to be creative if they want to work a lot, because their repertoire and audience appeal are limited.The oboist Heinz Holliger has taken a hard line about the problem: He commissions and splendidly interprets fearsome contemporary scores and does some conducting, so he doesn't have to play the same Mozart and Strauss concertos over and over again
Richard Stoltzman has taken a gentler, more audience-friendly approach.Years ago, he collaborated with the new music gurus Peter Serkin and Fred Sherry in the very countercultural chamber group Tashi, which won audiences over to dreaded contemporary scores like Messiaen's "Quartet for the End of Time
and now goes on the road with piano, bass, a slide show, and a repertoire that ranges from light classical to light jazz to light pop, with a few notable exceptions.Just the thing for the Vivaldi-at-brunch set, the yuppie audience that has embraced New Age as its very own easy listening
But you can't dismiss Mr. Stoltzman's music or his motives as merely commercial and lightweight.He believes in what he plays, and he plays superbly
He believes in what he plays, and he plays superbly.His recent appearance at the Metropolitan Museum, dubbed "A Musical Odyssey," was a case in point

Clad in his trademark black velvet suit, the soft-spoken clarinetist announced that his new album, "Inner Voices," had just been released, that his family was in the front row, and that it was his mother's birthday, so he was going to play her favorite tune from the record.He launched into Saint-Saens's "The Swan" from "Carnival of the Animals," a favorite encore piece for cellists, with lovely, glossy tone and no bite
And so it went through the first half: an ingeniously chosen potpourri of pieces, none longer than five minutes, none that would disturb or challenge a listener.Mr. Stoltzman introduced his colleagues: Bill Douglas, pianist/bassoonist/composer and an old buddy from Yale, and jazz bassist Eddie Gomez
Mr. Stoltzman introduced his colleagues: Bill Douglas, pianist/bassoonist/composer and an old buddy from Yale, and jazz bassist Eddie Gomez.An improvisational section was built around pieces by Mr. Douglas, beginning with "Golden Rain," a lilting, laid-back lead in to the uptempo "Sky," which gave Mr. Stoltzman the opportunity to wail in a high register and show off his fleet fingers

The end of the first half, however, brought what the standing-room-only crowd seemed to be waiting for: the pop singer Judy Collins, who appears on "Inner Voices." Glamorous and pure-voiced as ever, Ms. Collins sang Joni Mitchell's "For Free" -- about an encounter with a street-corner clarinetist, to which Mr. Stoltzman contributed a clarinet obligatto -- and Mr. Douglas's lush setting of a Gaelic blessing, "Deep Peace

"Deep Peace" also featured a slide show of lovely but predictable images of clouds, beaches, deserts, sunsets, etc.It was all too mellow to be believed, but they probably would have gotten away with it, had they not felt compelled to add Ms. Collins's signature tune, "Amazing Grace," and ask for audience participation
It was all too mellow to be believed, but they probably would have gotten away with it, had they not felt compelled to add Ms. Collins's signature tune, "Amazing Grace," and ask for audience participation.That went over the permissible line for warm and fuzzy feelings
Was this why some of the audience departed before or during the second half?Or was it because Ms. Collins had gone?Either way it was a pity
Either way it was a pity, because Mr. Stolzman offered the most substantial music of the evening just after intermission: Steve Reich's "New York Counterpoint," one of a series of Reich works that juxtapose a live performer with recorded tracks of his or her own playing. (Mr.Reich's new "Different Trains" for string quartet uses the technique magisterially
Mr. Stoltzman must have worried that his audience might not be able to take it: He warned us in advance that "New York Counterpoint" lasts 11 1/2 minutes
He also unfortunately illustrated this intricate, jazzy tapestry with Mr. Pearson's images, this time of geometric or repeating objects, in a kitschy mirroring of the musical structure that was thoroughly distracting from Mr. Reich's piece and Mr. Stoltzman's elegant execution of it.The rest of the concert was more straight jazz and mellow sounds written by Charlie Parker, Ornette Coleman, Bill Douglas and Eddie Gomez, with pictures for the Douglas pieces
The rest of the concert was more straight jazz and mellow sounds written by Charlie Parker, Ornette Coleman, Bill Douglas and Eddie Gomez, with pictures for the Douglas pieces.It was enjoyable to hear accomplished jazz without having to sit in a smoke-filled club, but like the first half, much of it was easy to take and ultimately forgettable

Such so-called male-sterile plants can then be fertilized by pollen from another strain of the plant, thereby producing hybrid seed.The new generation of plants will possess the flourishing, high-production trait known as "hybrid vigor," similar to that now seen in hybrid corn
On a commercial scale, the sterilization of the pollen-producing male part has only been achieved in corn and sorghum feed grains.That's because the male part, the tassel, and the female, the ear, are some distance apart on the corn plant

A similar technique is almost impossible to apply to other crops, such as cotton, soybeans and rice.The male part, the anthers of the plant, and the female, the pistils, of the same plant are within a fraction of an inch or even attached to each other.The anthers in these plants are difficult to clip off

At Plant Genetic Systems, researchers have isolated a pollen-inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility.Jan Leemans, research director, said this gene was successfully introduced in oil-producing rapeseed plants, a major crop in Europe and Canada, using as a carrier a "promoter gene" developed by Robert Goldberg at the University of California in Los Angeles
The sterilizing gene is expressed just before the pollen is about to develop and it deactivates the anthers of every flower in the plant.Mr. Leemans said this genetic manipulation doesn't hurt the growth of that plant
The researchers also pulled off a second genetic engineering trick in order to get male-sterile plants in large enough numbers to produce a commercial hybrid seed crop.They attached a second gene, for herbicide resistance, to the pollen-inhibiting gene.Both genes are then inserted into a few greenhouse plants, which are then pollinated and allowed to mature and produce seed. The laws of heredity dictate that half of the plants springing from these greenhouse-produced seeds will be male sterile and herbicide resistant and half will be male fertile and herbicide susceptible.The application of herbicide would kill off the male-fertile plants, leaving a large field of male-sterile plants that can be cross-pollinated to produce hybrid seed

He said the company is experimenting with the technique on alfalfa, and plans to include cotton and corn, among other crops.He said that even though virtually all corn seeds currently planted are hybrids, the genetic approach will obviate the need for mechanical emasculation of anthers, which costs U.S. seed producers about $70 million annually
In recent years, demand for hybrid seeds has spurred research at a number of chemical and biotechnology companies, including Monsanto Co., Shell Oil Co. and Eli Lilly & Co.One technique developed by some of these companies involves a chemical spray supposed to kill only a plant's pollen
Biosource Genetics Corp., Vacaville, Calif., is developing a spray containing a gene that spreads from cell to cell and interferes with the genes that are responsible for producing pollen.This gene, called "gametocide," is carried into the plant by a virus that remains active for a few days
Plant Genetic's approach "interesting" and "novel," and "complementary rather than competitive." "There is a large market out there hungry for hybrid seeds
Plant Genetic's success in creating genetically engineered male steriles doesn't automatically mean it would be simple to create hybrids in all crops.That's because pollination, while easy in corn because the carrier is wind, is more complex and involves insects as carriers in crops such as cotton

increasingly they're squaring off against one another in unprecedented public fashion.Already, the consequences are being felt by other players in the financial markets -- even governments
What triggered the latest clash was a skirmish over the timing of a New Zealand government bond issue.Nomura was attempting to organize the 50 billion-yen ($352 million) borrowing in Japan at a time when many Japanese banks, led by Industrial Bank of Japan, were pressuring the Wellington government to help them recover loans made to a defunct investment bank that had been owned by New Zealand's civil-service pension fund.Unwilling to put up new money for New Zealand until those debts are repaid, most banks refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing, forcing an embarrassed Nomura to postpone it this week
Nomura was attempting to organize the 50 billion-yen ($352 million) borrowing in Japan.most banks refused even to play administrative roles in the new financing, forcing an embarrassed Nomura to postpone it this week
The dispute shows clearly the global power of Japan's financial titans.Aside from Nomura's injured pride, the biggest victim so far has been the New Zealand government
With Japan's cash-flush banks aligned against it, though, raising money may be difficult.Not only can they block Wellington from raising money in Japan but as the largest underwriters in the Eurobond market, they might be able to scuttle borrowings there, too
New Zealand's finance minister, David Caygill, lashed out at such suggestions.He told reporters in Wellington Tuesday that the government hadn't guaranteed the loans to DFC New Zealand Ltd., an investment bank 80%-owned by the National Provident Fund, and wouldn't bail it out. "It may very well be what the Japanese banks want," he told Radio New Zealand. "I think it would be irresponsible and I am not about to be blackmailed by Japanese banks or any other international interests
It may very well be what the Japanese banks want.I think it would be irresponsible and I am not about to be blackmailed by Japanese banks or any other international interests
No less significant than the Japanese banks' attempt to cut off funds to pressure a foreign government are the implications of a confrontation between Japan securities and banking industries.Anxiety is rising over recent government proposals to eventually lower the strict barriers that now separate -- and protect -- the two industries from each other
Both sides are jealously guarding their turf, and relations have been at a flashpoint for months.The banks badly want to break into all aspects of the securities business.Meanwhile, the securities companies -- most of them smaller than the banks -- are seeking access only to limited kinds of banking that wouldn't open them to the full brunt of competition from the banks
In the past year, both have tried to stretch the limits of their businesses.Nomura started a credit-card venture with American Express Co. that allowed cardholders to use their Nomura securities accounts like a bank account, attracting the wrath of banks.And Industrial Bank of Japan started up a London securities subsidiary that sells Japanese stocks to non-Japanese institutions overseas, a move that stirred the anger of the stock brokerage firms

that Ford is in the best position to benefit from the large number of Jaguar shares that have moved over the past month into the hands of arbitragers waiting for the highest takeover bid.Jaguar's own defenses against a hostile bid are weakened because fewer than 3% of its shares are owned by employees and management
But GM officials said they, too, were surprised by the move, which left them to "consider all our options and explore matters further." Although GM has U.S. approval to buy up to 15% of Jaguar's stock, it hasn't yet disclosed how many shares it now owns
its plans for Jaguar would be more valuable in the long run than the initial windfalls investors might reap from a hostile Ford bid.

I was a last-minute (read interloping) attendee at a French journalism convention and so far the festivities had been taken up entirely by eating, drinking, smoking, sleeping and drinking.The man with the clipboard represented a halfhearted attempt to introduce a bit of les sportif into our itinerary
But as the French embody a Zen-like state of blase when it comes to athletics (try finding a Nautilus machine in Paris), my fellow conventioners were having none of it.The diners at my table simply lit more Gauloises and scoffed at the suggestion of interrupting a perfectly good Saturday morning to go golfing or even montgolfing (ballooning to you; the brothers Montgolfier, French of course, were the world's first hot-air balloonists

During the past 25 years, the number of balloonists (those who have passed a Federal Aviation Authority lighter-than-air test) have swelled from a couple hundred to several thousand, with some estimates running as high as 10,000.Some 30 balloon shows are held annually in the U.S., including the world's largest convocation of ersatz Phineas Foggs -- the nine-day Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta that attracts some 800,000 enthusiasts and more than 500 balloons, some of which are fetchingly shaped to resemble Carmen Miranda, Garfield or a 12-story-high condom

Concerns about the pace of the Vienna talks -- which are aimed at the destruction of some 100,000 weapons, as well as major reductions and realignments of troops in central Europe -- also are being registered at the Pentagon.Mr. Bush has called for an agreement by next September at the latest
But even though NATO negotiators have only 10 months left under the Bush timetable, they are still wrestling over such seemingly fundamental questions as "What is a tank?" Five of the six categories of weapons under negotiation haven't even been defined

But the issue is stickier than it seems.France, Britain and Italy all have light tanks they would like to keep out of the talks
Defining combat aircraft is even tougher.The Soviets insisted that aircraft be brought into the talks, then argued for exempting some 4,000 Russian planes because they are "solely defensive
The Soviets insisted that aircraft be brought into the talks, then argued for exempting some 4,000 Russian planes because they are "solely defensive." NATO hasn't budged from its insistence that any gun-carrying plane has offensive capability.The dispute over that issue, according to one U.S. official, is a "potential treaty stopper," and only President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev may be able to resolve it
Other nations aren't sure how many weapons they have in their own arsenals. "It's just going to be sloppy, both on our side and theirs {the Warsaw Pact's}
So far, neither the Bush administration nor arms-control experts in Congress seem moved by arguments that these problems may take more time to thrash out than President Bush has allowed.They argue that the bigger danger would be that the West would delay action so long that the Soviets might back away from the current conciliatory attitude
So what if you miss 50 tanks somewhere.The bottom line is that if we can get that {Warsaw Pact} superiority brought down to parity, we ought to keep pressing ahead as quickly as possible

The venture would be the latest in Coke's rapid expansion of overseas investment.So far this year, it has put nearly $700 million into bottling operations in Australia, New Zealand and France
The move also reflects Coke's eagerness to have a hand in developing the soft-drink markets in Pacific Basin countries.Aside from Europe, the Pacific division is where Coke will be focusing much of its attention for years to come
That's because when Coke looks to the Pacific area, it sees an economic and demographic gold mine.In countries such as Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore, economies are growing, resulting in a rise in disposable income that consumers can use for soft drinks
In the past, however, Coke has typically taken a minority stake in such ventures.By acquiring stakes in bottling companies in the U.S. and overseas, Coke has been able to improve bottlers' efficiency and production, and in some cases, marketing

The agreement ended a long impasse between the congressional leaders and the White House over the wage issue.President Bush in June vetoed a measure passed by Congress and said he wouldn't accept any minimum-wage rise that went beyond limits he set early in this year's debate on the issue
The compromise was a somewhat softened version of what the White House had said it would accept.Under the agreement with the House and Senate leaders, the minimum wage would rise from the current $3.35 an hour to $4.25 an hour by April 1991
Mr. Bush had been holding out for a bill boosting the wage floor to $4.25 an hour by the end of 1991, coupled with a six-month training wage for workers newly hired by any employer.Under the compromise, the $4.25 level would be reached nine months earlier, while the training subminimum would be shorter, unless it is tied to a training plan

Armstrong World Industries Inc. agreed in principle to sell its carpet operations to Shaw Industries Inc.The price wasn't disclosed but one analyst estimated that it was $150 million
Moreover, such a sale could help Armstrong reassure its investors and deter the Belzbergs, who own a 9.85% stake in the Lancaster, Pa., company.Analysts expect Armstrong to use proceeds of the sale to reduce debt, buy back stock or perhaps finance an acquisition

It's also unnecessary.Amateur spy-chaser Clifford Stoll is a real person, or as he might waggishly put it, a surreal person
He is 37, an astronomer with impressive credentials, and something of a genius at making computers do his bidding.He once described himself as a "Berkeley Hippie," and played the role well; obligatory ragged jeans, a thicket of long hair and rejection of all things conventional, including, for a time at least, formal marriage to his "sweetheart," Martha Matthews
He also is an entertaining writer, combining wisecracks and wordplay with programmatic detail and lucid explanations of how computers work.In "The Cuckoo's Egg" (Doubleday, 326 pages, $19.95), he spins a remarkable tale of his efforts over 18 months to catch a computer spy
The result last spring was the arrest by West German authorities of five young West Germans, accused of stealing information from computers in the U.S. and Europe and selling it to the Soviet KGB.One of them, 25-year-old Markus Hess of Hannover, allegedly used the international telecommunications network to break into more than 30 high-security computers in the U.S., searching for secrets

Mr. Stoll draws his title from the cuckoo's habit of laying eggs in the nests of other birds, making them surrogate parents.The computer spy had discovered that a popular editing/electronic mail program called Gnu-Emacs could do tricks with the widely used Unix operating system created by AT&T.Using Gnu-Emacs, the spy could substitute a bogus "atrun" program for the one that routinely cleans up the Unix system every five minutes

The new Mips machine, called the RC6280, will cost $150,000 for a basic system.The computer processes 55 million instructions per second and uses only one central processing chip, unlike many rival machines using several processors

At that price the computer offers up to 10 times the performance of similar machines. "In the price range it's a tremendously high-performing product
the new machine will also be used by businesses and for communications. "This clearly demonstrates that Mips is a systems company rather than just a chip company
The Control Data deal is a boon for Mips because it gives the the five-year-old company one more ally as it battles more established electronic concerns such as Sun, Hewlett-Packard Co., Motorola Inc. and Intel Corp. for the emerging market for RISC machines.RISC technology speeds up a computer by simplifying the internal software

Instead the RTC should consider using Treasury debt, which is less expensive and subject to oversight by Congress.The spending could be exempted from meeting deficit-reduction targets in the Gramm-Rudman budget law
The RTC has projected that it will require between $50 billion to $100 billion in temporary working capital.The borrowing to raise these funds would be paid off as assets of sick thrifts are sold
The borrowing to raise these funds would be paid off as assets of sick thrifts are sold.The new S&L law allows the RTC to issue notes for as much as 85% of the value of the assets it holds
But higher interest rates paid on off-budget debt could add billions to the bailout costs, and wouldn't be subject to congressional scrutiny.To allow this massive level of unfettered federal borrowing without prior congressional approval would be irresponsible
The RTC will have to sell or merge hundreds of insolvent thrifts over the next three years.The new S&L bailout law allows $50 billion to be spent to sell or merge sick S&Ls and their assets, but that is a net cost
But the worst possibility would be raising no working capital, he said. "If working capital financing is not provided the RTC may have to slow {S&L sales} or dump acquired assets through fire sales

Under the agreement, Healthcare, a manager of health-care facilities, said it would pay HealthVest $3.9 million in overdue rent and mortgage payments and repay $1.1 million in funds that HealthVest advanced for construction work on facilities.In return, HealthVest agreed that it won't exercise its rights and remedies against Healthcare during the 120-day period
After the payment, Healthcare still will be $6.5 million in arrears on rent and mortgage payments to HealthVest, a real estate investment trust whose portfolio consists largely of properties operated by Healthcare.Healthcare has given HealthVest a 12% note for that overdue amount, to be repaid over three years
In addition, Healthcare agreed to make monthly rent and mortgage payments of $2.7 million to $3 million to HealthVest during the standstill period, to be paid when Healthcare successfully completes asset sales.Because Healthcare actually owes HealthVest $4.2 million in rent and mortgage payments each month, the amount due above the amount paid will be added to the three-year note
The funds should help ease a cash bind at HealthVest, which has been unable to pay its debts because Healthcare hasn't made complete rent and mortgage payments since July.HealthVest has paid two of the three banks it owed interest to in October and is in negotiations with the third bank
Healthcare, which has been in a severe liquidity bind, said it is able to make the payments because it completed a transaction with Greenery Rehabilitation Group Inc. in which Greenery purchased stock and warrants for $500,000 and loaned Healthcare $9 million.The loan is backed by Healthcare's 5.4% stake in HealthVest and interest in certain facilities
I was pleased to note that your Oct. 23 Centennial Journal item recognized the money-fund concept as one of the significant events of the past century.Actually, about two years ago, the Journal listed the creation of the money fund as one of the 10 most significant events in the world of finance in the 20th century
But the Reserve Fund, America's first money fund, was not named, nor were the creators of the money-fund concept, Harry Brown and myself.We innovated telephone redemptions, daily dividends, total elimination of share certificates and the constant $1 pershare pricing, all of which were painfully thought out and not the result of some inadvertence on the part of the SEC

But then Judge O'Kicki often behaved like a man who would be king -- and, some say, an arrogant and abusive one.While his case may be extreme, it reflects the vulnerability of many small communities to domineering judges
Last March, nine months after the judge's swearing-in, the state attorney general's office indicted him on a sweeping array of charges alleging more than 10 years of "official oppression" in Cambria County, a depressed steel and mining community in western Pennsylvania.The allegations, ranging from theft and bribery to coercion and lewdness, paint a disquieting picture
the judge, now 59 years old, harassed his secretaries, made imperial demands on his staff and hounded anyone who crossed him.Bailiffs claimed they were required to chauffeur him to and from work, mow his lawn, chop his wood, fix his car and even drop by his house to feed his two grown mutts, Dixie and Husky
Bailiffs claimed they were required to chauffeur him to and from work, mow his lawn, chop his wood, fix his car and even drop by his house to feed his two grown mutts, Dixie and Husky.One former bailiff charged that the judge double-crossed him by reneging on a promise of a better paying job after pocketing a $500 bribe
Some of the allegations are simply bizarre.Two former secretaries told the grand jury they were summoned to the judge's chambers on separate occasions to take dictation, only to find the judge in his bikini underwear
Two former secretaries told the grand jury they were summoned to the judge's chambers on separate occasions to take dictation, only to find the judge in his bikini underwear.One secretary testified that the judge once called her to his office while wearing nothing at all
The judge, suspended from his bench pending his trial, which began this week, vehemently denies all the allegations against him, calling them "ludicrous" and "imaginative, political demagoguery." He blames the indictment on local political feuding, unhappiness with his aggressive efforts to clear the courthouse's docket and a vendetta by state investigators and prosecutors angered by some of his rulings against them
I don't know whose toes I've stepped on.I'll find out, eventually, who pushed the state police buttons into action
Even if only some of the allegations stand up, however, they provide ample testimony to the awesome power of judges in rural communities.That power can sometimes be abused, particularly since jurists in smaller jurisdictions operate without many of the restraints that serve as corrective measures in urban areas
Lawyers and their clients who frequently bring business to a country courthouse can expect to appear before the same judge year after year.Fear of alienating that judge is pervasive
Judge O'Kicki, a stern and forbidding-looking man, has been a fixture in the local legal community for more than two decades.The son of an immigrant stonemason of Slovenian descent, he was raised in a small borough outside Ebensburg, the Cambria County seat, and put himself through the University of Pittsburgh Law School
and put himself through the University of Pittsburgh Law School.He graduated near the top of his class, serving on the school law review with Richard Thornburgh
It was also in law school that Mr. O'Kicki and his first wife had the first of seven daughters.He divorced his first wife three years ago and married the daughter of his court clerk
Last year, Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice John P. Flaherty called Mr. O'Kicki one of the finest judges "not only in Pennsylvania but in the United States." Clearly, the judge has had his share of accomplishments

He probably was the smartest guy who ever sat on our bench.He's sharp as a tack
He's sharp as a tack.He could grasp an issue with the blink of an eye
For more than a decade, virtually no one complained about Judge O'Kicki. "What about those institutions that are supposed to be the bedrock of society, the banks and the bar association. . . ?" wrote a columnist for the Tribune-Democrat, a newspaper in nearby Johnstown, shortly after the scandal became public. "If only a banker or a lawyer had spoken out years ago, the judicial process wouldn't be under the taint it is today

Johnstown attorney Richard J. Green Jr. shelled out $500 in loans to the judge over five years.The judge never made a pretense of repaying the money
When Mr. Green won a $240,000 verdict in a land condemnation case against the state in June 1983, he says Judge O'Kicki unexpectedly awarded him an additional $100,000.Mr. Green thought little of it until the judge walked up to him after the courtroom had cleared and suggested a kickback
But he didn't complain to the state's Judicial Inquiry and Review Board, either, saying later that he feared retribution.Mr. O'Kicki said he will respond to Mr. Green's allegation at his trial
The practice of law is a matter of biting one's lip when you live in a small community.One had best not dance on top of a coffin until the lid is sealed tightly shut
The judge was considered imperious, abrasive and ambitious.He sipped tea sweetened with honey from his high-backed leather chair at his bench, while scribbling notes ordering spectators to stop whispering or to take off their hats in his courtroom
He sipped tea sweetened with honey from his high-backed leather chair at his bench, while scribbling notes ordering spectators to stop whispering or to take off their hats in his courtroom.Four years ago, he jailed all nine members of the Cambria County School Board for several hours after they defied his order to extend the school year by several weeks to make up for time lost during a teachers' strike
Visitors in his chambers say he could cite precisely the years, months, weeks and days remaining until mandatory retirement would force aside the presiding president judge, giving Judge O'Kicki the seniority required to take over as the county's top court administrator.The judge, they say, was fiercely proud of his abilities and accomplishments
My name is judge," Judge O'Kicki told a car salesman in Ebensburg when he bought a new red Pontiac Sunbird in October 1984, according to the grand-jury report.The dealership dutifully recorded the sale under the name "Judge O'Kicki
The arrogance of a judge, his demeanor, the way he handles people are not a basis for filing a complaint.Until this came up and hit the press, there was never any indication that he was doing anything wrong
State investigators dispute that view now, particularly in light of the judge's various business dealings in Cambria County.The judge came under scrutiny in late 1987, after the state attorney general's office launched an unrelated investigation into corruption in Cambria County
The inquiry soon focused on the judge.Even his routine business transactions caused trouble, according to the grand jury report
Even his routine business transactions caused trouble, according to the grand jury report.When the judge bought his new Sunbird from James E. Black Pontiac-Cadillac in Ebensburg five years ago, the dealership had "certain apprehensions" about the judge's reputation, according to the grand-jury report.The dealership took the extra step of having all the paper work for the transaction pre-approved by Ebensburg's local lender, Laurel Bank. Then, as an additional precaution, the car dealership took the judge's photograph as he stood next to his new car with sales papers in hand -- proof that he had received the loan documents. But when the judge received his payment book, he disavowed the deal. "There was no loan, there is no loan, there never shall be a loan," the judge wrote the bank on his judicial stationery, according to the report

But when the judge received his payment book, he disavowed the deal. "There was no loan, there is no loan, there never shall be a loan," the judge wrote the bank on his judicial stationery, according to the report
Later, the judge went a step farther.After Laurel Bank tried to repossess the car, a vice president asked him to intervene in an unrelated legal dispute involving a trust account.The judge wrote again. "I find myself in an adversary relationship with Laurel Bank, and I am not inclined to extend myself as far as any favors are concerned," the judge wrote back in a letter attached to the grand jury's report. "Perhaps if my personal matters can be resolved with Laurel bank in the near future, I may be inclined to reconsider your request

Perhaps if my personal matters can be resolved with Laurel bank in the near future, I may be inclined to reconsider your request. . . ." The judge now says it was "unfortunate" that he chose to write the letter but says "there was certainly no intent to extort there
The bank acquiesced.It refinanced the judge's loan, lowered its interest rate and accepted a trade-in that hadn't originally been part of the deal -- a beat up 1981 Chevy Citation the dealer had to repair before it could be resold
The incident wasn't the only time the judge got special treatment from his local bank.Two years later, he wrote to complain that the interest he was paying on an unsecured $10,000 loan was "absolutely onerous." Paul L. Kane, Laurel's president at the time, quickly responded.The bank, he wrote back, was "immediately" lowering the rate by 3.5%, "as a concession to you

The surprise announcement came after the IRS broke off negotiations with Mr. Hunt on a settlement of the one-time tycoon's personal bankruptcy case.Although the action removes one obstacle in the way of an overall settlement to the case, it also means that Mr. Hunt could be stripped of virtually all of his assets if the Tax Court rules against him in a 1982 case heard earlier this year in Washington, D.C
Although the action removes one obstacle in the way of an overall settlement to the case, it also means that Mr. Hunt could be stripped of virtually all of his assets if the Tax Court rules against him in a 1982 case heard earlier this year in Washington, D.C.The IRS has been seeking more than $300 million in back taxes from Mr. Hunt
Separately, a federal judge hearing Mr. Hunt's bankruptcy case yesterday turned down a proposed $65.7 million settlement between Mr. Hunt and Minpeco S.A., another major creditor in the case.The Peruvian minerals concern had been seeking a claim of $251 million against Mr. Hunt
In addition to turning down the compromise, Judge Harold C. Abramson said he would allow a claim of only $19.7 million.Minpeco attorneys said they would appeal the decision to a federal district court
But they have been at odds over how much Mr. Hunt would owe the government after his assets are sold.The IRS had demanded $90 million but Mr. Hunt would agree to no more than $60 million
An increasing number of big Japanese investors are buying up U.S. home mortgages that have been pooled and packaged for sale as interest-bearing instruments known as mortgage-backed securities.As much as 10% of new U.S. mortgage securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, now flow into Japanese hands
You can't say it's a "tsunami" (tidal wave), but we're making some headway.Interest is a great deal higher than it was a year ago
Interest is a great deal higher than it was a year ago." The steady growth of the mortgage securities market in the U.S. has even triggered talk of building up a similar market here
Evidence of the growing Japanese demand for mortgage securities abounds.Earlier this year, Blackstone Group, a New York investment bank, had no trouble selling out a special $570 million mortgage-securities trust it created for Japanese investors
Earlier this year, Blackstone Group, a New York investment bank, had no trouble selling out a special $570 million mortgage-securities trust it created for Japanese investors.Industrial Bank of Japan, which claims to be the biggest Japanese buyer of U.S. mortgage securities, says it will more than double its purchases this year, to an amount one official puts at several billion dollars
Last year, there were only several big investors who were interested.This year, some investors are changing their policies and investing a lot
First, they are safe.While they aren't backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, as Treasury bonds are, it is widely assumed that the government would support them if necessary
While they aren't backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, as Treasury bonds are, it is widely assumed that the government would support them if necessary. (U.S.Treasury bonds are still the dollar-denominated investment of choice for long-term Japanese investors
Second, they are liquid.The secondary market in federally backed mortgage securities now exceeds $900 billion, or nearly half of the $2.2 trillion in U.S. residential mortgages issued
Third, they offer high yields.At the moment, some offer as much as 1.6 to 1.8 percentage points over Treasury securities of similar maturities
But there is a risk.Since most mortgages can be prepaid or refinanced at any time, issuers of mortgage securities retain the right to buy back their bonds before maturity
issuers of mortgage securities retain the right to buy back their bonds before maturity.That's a headache for long-term investors, since it forces them to reinvest their money
But they didn't lose touch with the U.S. issuers.Since 1985, Japanese investors have bought nearly 80% of $10 billion in Fannie Mae corporate debt issued to foreigners
In addition, further packaging of mortgage-backed securities, such as Blackstone's fund, have reduced the effects of prepayment risk and automatically reinvest monthly payments so institutions don't have to.Freddie Mac for years has offered a so-called participation certificate that guarantees it won't be prepaid for a set number of years and offers semiannual payments
that their adoption forces bidders to negotiate with a corporation's directors, who are thereby put in a better position to pursue the long-term interests of the corporation.that corporations with poison pills have experienced greater stock-price appreciation than corporations without poison pills during the past few years
that they harm shareholders by letting corporate management defeat takeover bids at premium prices and by deterring premium bids from ever being made to shareholders.These critics are backed by several academic studies showing that the adoption of poison pills reduces shareholder values not merely in the short run, but also over longer periods
Institutional investors that must evaluate poison pills on a regular basis are interested less in this general debate than in the answers to specific questions about the corporation issuing the pill.Does this corporation have a high-quality management team with a good track record
Does this corporation have a high-quality management team with a good track record?Does this team have a viable strategy for improving shareholder values, and does this strategy require implementation over an extended period
Does this corporation have a high-quality management team with a good track record?Does this team have a viable strategy for improving shareholder values, and does this strategy require implementation over an extended period?Will the adoption of this particular form of a poison pill significantly improve the chances for management to carry out this strategy
However, the problem is that once most poison pills are adopted, they survive forever.Although the current management team may be outstanding, who will be the CEO in 10 years
Although the current management team may be outstanding, who will be the CEO in 10 years?Although the five-year strategy may be excellent, what will be the strategy in 25 years
The solution to this problem is a time-limited poison pill.The limit could range from three years to seven years, depending on the composition of the management team and the nature of its strategic plan
The limit could range from three years to seven years.At the end of this period, the poison pill would be eliminated automatically, unless a new poison pill were approved by the then-current shareholders
One rare example of a time-limited poison pill is the shareholder rights plan adopted by Pennzoil last year after it received a huge litigation settlement from Texaco.Pennzoil's poison pill covers five years in order to give current management enough time to put these proceeds to work in a prudent manner
Another interesting example is the poison pill adopted recently by Pittsburgh-based National Intergroup Inc., a diversified holding company.The State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which owned about 7% of the company's voting stock, worked with management to devise a time-limited poison pill.This pill automatically expires after three years unless continued by a vote of the shareholders
The State of Wisconsin Investment Board, which owned about 7% of the company's voting stock, worked with management to devise a time-limited poison pill.This pill automatically expires after three years unless continued by a vote of the shareholders
More widespread time limits on poison pills would allow shareholders to evaluate a specific poison pill within the context of a specific management team's strategy.Such concrete analysis is likely to lead to more fruitful dialogue between management and shareholders than the abstract debate about poison pills

But in another sense, the $846 million purchase is uncharacteristically nervy.The usually cautious giant will become the majority owner of the company that owns New York's beloved Rockefeller Center at a time when tensions over Japanese purchases of U.S. property are at an all-time high
Officials of Rockefeller Group and Mitsubishi Estate prefer to focus on the affinities, nearly dismissing the threat of a backlash from the U.S. public. "We think there will be positive as well as negative reactions," says Raymond Pettit, senior vice president and chief financial officer of Rockefeller Group
We think there will be positive as well as negative reactions.On balance, we think it will be positive
Since the mid-1980s, Japan's other major real estate purchases in the U.S. include Dai-Ichi Seimei America Corp. 's $670 million purchase of an office building at 153 East 53rd St. in Manhattan in 1987 and Mitsui Fudosan Inc. 's $610 million purchase of the Exxon Building, part of Rockefeller Center, in 1986.In Los Angeles, Arco Plaza was sold to Shuwa Corp. for $620 million in 1986, and Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. paid $300 million for Atlanta's IBM Tower last year
Many Japanese companies have taken the warnings by the country's leaders to heart and sought development partnerships rather than landmark properties.Mitsubishi Estate's decision to buy into Rockefeller reflects the degree to which companies are irritated by the pressure to act for the good of Japan
Mitsubishi Estate's decision to buy into Rockefeller reflects the degree to which companies are irritated by the pressure to act for the good of Japan. "Those who have no money and aren't buying think it's right to refrain, but those with money who want to buy for themselves pay no attention

Sony is acquiring Columbia and Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. in two separate transactions valued at more than $5 billion.Warner Communications Inc., which is being acquired by Time Warner, has filed a $1 billion breach-of-contract suit against Sony and the two producers
Warner Communications Inc. has filed a $1 billion breach-of-contract suit against Sony and the two producers.Warner has a five-year exclusive contract with Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters that requires them to make movies exclusively at the Warner Bros. studio
But it may amount to little more than posturing; the two have continued on-again, off-again settlement talks over the last few weeks, and people familiar with the talks say the matter could be resolved within a week
Instead, Sony is likely to agree to let Warner participate in certain of its businesses, such as the record club of Sony's CBS Records unit.Warner has surpassed Sony as the largest record company, but it doesn't have a powerful world-wide record club like CBS
One, for example, came from CBS Records Chairman Walter Yetnikoff.In his affidavit, Mr. Yetnikoff accused Warner Chairman Steven J. Ross of having an "antiSony, anti-Japanese bias" and said that Mr. Ross had tried to talk him out of letting Sony buy CBS Records two years ago for that reason
But despite the acrimony between Mr. Ross and Mr. Yetnikoff, officials of the Time side of Time Warner have reportedly been increasingly interested in a settlement that might yield attractive business opportunities.Time executives such as the company's president, N.J. Nicholas have no personal relationships or ego at stake in the fight over the Guber-Peters duo, and were never directly drawn into the fray
Any settlement is also expected to exclude Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters from any of the projects they were working on at Warner.The Guber-Peters duo have 50 projects in various stages of development and production at Warner, including "Bonfire of the Vanities" and "A Bright Shining Lie
But that doesn't mean Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters might not eventually get their hands on some of their projects; studios develop hundreds of movies but produce only 10 to 20 each year
studios develop hundreds of movies but produce only 10 to 20 each year.Once a studio chooses not to actually make a movie that is in development, producers are typically free to take it elsewhere
But in acquiring Guber-Peters Entertainment, Sony will actually get a piece of the profits from "Batman," since the publicly held concern gets certain revenue from the movies Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters produce.The two producers own a combined 28% stake in Guber-Peters
Gulf Power's guilty plea before U.S. District Judge Robert L. Vining yesterday marks the end of only one part of a wide-ranging inquiry of Southern Co.The company is the subject of a federal grand jury investigation into whether its officials and its utility subsidiaries conspired to cover up their accounting for spare parts to evade federal income taxes
The terms announced today are strictly between the United States and Gulf Power.This is only a further step in a lengthy investigation
The plea settlement does not allow Southern Co. to charge any of the $500,000 to its customers, or take action against employees who provided information during the federal inquiry.Gulf Power had been under investigation for violating the Utility Holding Company Act, which prohibits public utilities from making political contributions
And our action today will allow Gulf Power to avoid prolonged, distracting legal proceedings." He did not say what effect, if any, the $500,000 fine would have on the company's earnings
The Appleyard Agency, for example, allegedly made contributions from 1982 to 1984 to various funds for political candidates.The contributions were funded by monthly payments of $1,000 to $2,000 to Appleyard in the guise of a "special production fee" -- in effect, hiding the nature of the payments from the Internal Revenue Service
The government also indicated that former Gulf Power senior vice president Jacob F. "Jake" Horton was the mastermind behind the use of the ad agencies -- Appleyard, Dick Leonard Group II Inc. and Hemmer & Yates Corp. -- to make payments to various political candidates from 1981 to 1988.Mr. Horton, who oversaw Gulf Power's governmental-affairs efforts, died mysteriously in a plane crash in April after learning he might be fired following the uncovering of irregularities in a company audit

FOR YEARS, costume jewelry makers fought a losing battle.Jewelry displays in department stores were often cluttered and uninspired
To increase their share of that business, jewelry makers such as Crystal Brands Inc.

Mr. Moon planned to convert millions of Americans to his unique brand of Christianity -- in which he plays the role of Old Testament-style temporal, political messiah -- and then to make the U.S. part of a unified international theocracy.His original strategy (in itself a brilliant innovation for spreading a religion) was to create new economic enterprises each time he wanted to extend and fund his various religious missions

It is still common to read in the press that the church has 10,000 or more full-time American members and 25,000 "associates." Some estimates have gone as high as 80,000 members
But internal church documents clearly show that at its publicity-seeking heights, as when it organized a spectacular Yankee Stadium bicentennial rally in 1976, there actually were only about 2,000 full-time Unification Church members in the U.S. Mr. Moon's support for a Watergate-beleaguered Richard Nixon, the Koreagate scandal, and his prison sentence for income-tax evasion did not help the church's recruitment efforts

That the membership number has even kept close to its 1976 size is the result of the "graying" of the church.Many of the enthusiastic young "Moonies" of the Nixon era who remained faithful to Father Moon are now parents, producing new members by procreation rather than conversion
The reputed wealth of the Unification Church is another matter of contention.For a while in the 1970s it seemed Mr. Moon was on a spending spree, with such purchases as the former New Yorker Hotel and its adjacent Manhattan Center; a fishing/processing conglomerate with branches in Alaska, Massachusetts, Virginia and Louisiana; a former Christian Brothers monastery and the Seagram family mansion (both picturesquely situated on the Hudson River); shares in banks from Washington to Uruguay; a motion picture production company, and newspapers, such as the Washington Times, the New York City Tribune (originally the News World), and the successful Spanish-language Noticias del Mundo.

Mr. Moon's two English-language U.S. newspapers illustrate the scope of this financial drain.Start-up costs for the Washington Times alone were close to $50 million, and the total amount lost in this journalistic black hole was estimated at $150 million by 1984
which are a further drain.that not even their editors know for sure how much these show-piece publications, along with the newspapers, have cost Mr. Moon

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the majority holder of Manville acknowledged that the cash portion of its initial funding of $765 million will be depleted next year, and that alternative sources of funds will be necessary to meet its obligations.The trust, which was created as part of Manville's bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of asbestos-related diseases, ultimately expects to receive $2.5 billion from Manville, but its cash flow from investments has so far lagged behind its payments to victims

Manville, a forest and building products concern, has offered to pay the trust $500 million for a majority of Manville's convertible preferred stock.Manville and the trust are discussing the offer, but no decision has been made

This corporate glasnost is a big reason Nissan, after years of making lackluster cars and lousy profits, has loosened up its rigid ways and now is riding a string of hits, ranging from the sleek Maxima sedan and Porsche-like 300ZX to the whimsically nostalgic Pao, a minicar sold only in Japan.The company's turnaround is far from complete
The company's turnaround is far from complete; many crucial tests are just beginning
The big one: A company's culture can't be radically changed unless top management first admits that things have gone badly awry and then publicly leads the charge.Atsushi Muramatsu, Nissan's executive vice president for finance, helped set the tone in December 1986, when the company was heading toward the first operating loss by a Japanese auto maker since the nation's postwar recovery
Atsushi Muramatsu, Nissan's executive vice president for finance, helped set the tone in December 1986, when the company was heading toward the first operating loss by a Japanese auto maker since the nation's postwar recovery. "This is a time of self-criticism to discover what is wrong with us," he said
This is a time of self-criticism to discover what is wrong with us," he said.Yutaka Kume, who took the helm as Nissan's president in June 1985, added simply, "I am deeply disappointed
No wonder.Nissan, Japan's second-largest auto maker and the world's fourth-largest, was getting beat up not only by its bigger rival, Toyota Motor Corp., but also by Honda Motor Co., the most successful Japanese car company in the U.S. but a relative pipsqueak in Japan
Nissan's market share in Japan had been dropping year by year since the beginning of the decade.Its U.S. sales sagged, partly because of price increases due to the rising yen
Its U.S. sales sagged, partly because of price increases due to the rising yen.Worst of all, Nissan was preoccupied with management infighting, cronyism and corporate rigidity

This system produced boring, boxy cars that consumers just weren't buying.Desperately hoping to spark sales, Nissan transferred 5,000 middle managers and plant workers to dealerships
Some town-watching excursions were downright comic.One group of middle-aged manufacturing men from the company's Zama plant outside Tokyo was supposed to check out a trendy restaurant in the city

Mr. Kume himself visited Honda's headquarters in Tokyo's upscale Aoyama district.He liked the well-lighted lobby display of Honda's cars and trucks so much that he had Nissan's gloomy lobby exhibit refurbished
Later, Nissan borrowed other Honda practices, including an engineering "idea contest" to promote inventiveness.One engineer developed a "crab car" that moves sideways
so much so, in fact, that some older employees have resisted.Nissan handled the die-hards in a typically Japanese fashion: They weren't fired but instead "were neglected
Despite the pain of adjusting, the cultural revolution has begun to yield exciting cars.A year ago, the company completely revamped its near-luxury sedan, the $17,699 Maxima, which competes against a broad range of upscale sedans; it replaced its boxy, pug-nosed body with sleek, aerodynamic lines
A year ago, the company completely revamped its near-luxury sedan, the $17,699 Maxima, which competes against a broad range of upscale sedans; it replaced its boxy, pug-nosed body with sleek, aerodynamic lines
Since then, Nissan also has launched new versions of the $13,249 240SX sporty coupe and 300ZX sports car.The restyled 300ZX costs as much as $33,000 and is squared off against the Porche 944, which begins at $41,900

In its home market, Nissan has grabbed attention with limited-production minicars featuring styling odd enough to be cute.One is the Pao, a tiny coupe with a peelback canvas top and tilted headlights that give it a droopy-eyed look
One is the Pao, a tiny coupe with a peelback canvas top and tilted headlights that give it a droopy-eyed look.Nissan initially planned to sell just 10,000 Paos, but sales have passed 50,000, and there's a one-year waiting list for the car
Then, there's the S-Cargo, an offbeat delivery van with a snail-like body that inspired its name.Nissan helped develop a Tokyo restaurant with both vehicles as its design theme
Nissan helped develop a Tokyo restaurant with both vehicles as its design theme.The chairs are S-Cargo seats, and a gift shop sells such items as alarm clocks styled like the Pao's oversized speedometer
All these vehicles have sharply improved Nissan's morale and image -- but haven't done much for its market share.Nissan had 29% of the Japanese car market in 1980 before beginning a depressing eight-year slide that continued through last year
that continued through last year.Strong sales so far this year are certain to turn the tide, but even the 25% market share that Nissan expects in 1989 will leave it far below its position at the beginning of the decade
Nissan concedes that it won't recoup all its market-share losses in Japan until at least 1995, and even that timetable might prove optimistic. "Everyone else is going to catch up" with Nissan's innovative designs

Why?So far, Nissan's new-model successes are mostly specialized vehicles with limited sales potential
So far, Nissan's new-model successes are mostly specialized vehicles with limited sales potential.In compact and subcompact cars, the bread-and-butter sales generators for Japanese auto makers, Nissan still trails Toyota and Honda
that that will start to change this fall, with its new version of the Stanza compact sedan.The Stanza has been a nonentity compared with Honda's hugely successful Accord and Toyota's Camry
Nissan instead has kept its new Stanza a bit smaller than that and cut the base price 6%; at $11,450, Stanza prices start $749 below the predecessor model yet have a more-powerful engine
at $11,450, Stanza prices start $749 below the predecessor model yet have a more-powerful engine.Accord prices start at $12,345
Even if the new Stanza succeeds, Nissan will remain behind in the subcompact segment, where its Sentra doesn't measure up to the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla.Nissan will introduce a completely revamped Sentra next fall
At the opposite end of the market, Nissan launches its luxury Infiniti division on Nov. 8 -- three years after Honda pioneered Japanese luxury cars and two months after Toyota's Lexus went on sale.Nissan started advertising Infiniti fully eight months before the cars hit American showrooms

The ads featured fences, rocks and pussy-willow buds -- almost anything but the cars themselves.The ads have generated some laughs but also plenty of attention because they are so unlike any other U.S. auto advertising
On the other hand, Nissan's sales goals for Infiniti are modest compared with Toyota's targets for Lexus.Nissan will build only about 3,500 of the $38,000 Infiniti Q45 sedans each month, sending about 2,000 of them to the U.S. and keeping the rest for sale in Japan.Toyota wants to sell about 49,000 Lexus LS400 sedans next year in the U.S. alone

that Nissan is being prudent in following its slow-startup strategy instead of simply copying Lexus. "Infiniti is Nissan's big business move for the 21st century
Infiniti is Nissan's big business move for the 21st century, and we're in no hurry to generate large profits right away.Despite plans to add two new Infiniti models next year, bringing the total to four, Infiniti won't show profits for at least five years
These days Nissan can afford that strategy, even though profits aren't exactly robust.Nissan had record net income of 114.63 billion yen ($868 million) in the fiscal year ended last March 31, a remarkable recovery from the 20.39 billion yen of two years earlier, when the company lost money on operations
Nissan had record net income of 114.63 billion yen ($868 million) in the fiscal year ended last March 31, a remarkable recovery from the 20.39 billion yen of two years earlier, when the company lost money on operations.Nissan has increased earnings more than market share by cutting costs and by taking advantage of a general surge in Japanese car sales
But Nissan expects to earn only 120 billion yen in the current fiscal year, a modest increase of 4.7%.The big reason: For all its cost-cutting, Nissan remains less efficient than Toyota

In its last fiscal year, Nissan's profit represented just 2.3% of sales, compared with 4.3% at Toyota.To help close the gap, Nissan recently established a top-level cost-cutting committee
Nissan is the world's only auto maker currently building vehicles in all three of the world's key economic arenas -- the U.S., Japan and Europe.That gives it an enviable strategic advantage, at least until its rivals catch up, but also plenty of managerial headaches
We are in a transitional phase from being a Japanese company to becoming an international company based in Japan.that Nissan will soon establish a holding company overseeing all U.S. operations, just as it's doing in Europe
Perhaps the biggest challenge, however, will be to prevent a return to its former corporate rigidity as its recovery continues.Already, personnel officials are talking about the need for a "Phase Two" cultural-reform effort of some sort

The two leaders will meet on Dec. 2 and 3, alternating the two days of meetings between a U.S. and a Soviet naval vessel in the Mediterranean Sea.The unusual seaborne meeting won't disrupt plans for a formal summit meeting next spring or summer, at which an arms-control treaty is likely to be completed

that the December meeting, which was announced simultaneously in Moscow, will be held in the unusual setting of ships at sea to hold down the "fanfare" and force the two sides to limit participation to just small groups of advisers. "By doing it in this manner we can have more time without the press of social activities or mandatory joint appearances, things of that nature for public consumption
As the two sides plan to hold a full-scale summit in late spring-early summer next year, they found it useful, I would say even necessary, to hold an interim informal meeting." Although no specific agreements are expected that doesn't mean they will be without an agenda
The president specifically mentioned U.S. economic advice to Moscow as a possible topic.Mr. Gorbachev has for months been publicly urging the U.S. to drop its restrictions on Soviet trade

Don't take this as some big opening for major movement on economic cooperation, or arms control, or the environment.Those things will all come up, but in a fairly informal way
This is vintage George Bush.This was George Bush's own idea
This was George Bush's own idea.It's George Bush wanting to meet a foreign leader and talk to him directly
one other issue the Soviets are likely to want to raise is naval force reductions.that, given the meeting's setting at sea, Gorbachev is unlikely to pass up the opportunity to press once again for negotiated cuts in the navies of both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact
That theme has been a recurring one for Soviet military officials for much of this year.They argue that as the Kremlin follows through on announced plans to cut land forces -- the Soviets' area of greatest strength -- the U.S. should show more willingness to cut sea forces -- Washington's area of greatest superiority
One of the reasons Bush administration aides are anxious to insist that the coming meeting will be informal is to avoid comparisons with the last such loosely structured superpower gathering, former President Reagan's 1986 meeting with Mr. Gorbachev in Reykjavik, Iceland.That meeting sent shivers through the Western alliance because Mr. Reagan was pulled into discussing the possible elimination of nuclear weapons without consulting American allies
it actually was the arguments of leaders within the Soviet bloc itself that led the president to seek the December meeting.Mr. Bush decided he wanted the meeting after talking in Europe in July with the leaders of Poland and Hungary, who urged him to support Mr. Gorbachev's efforts to transform the Soviet system and to urge him to loosen his grip on Eastern Europe

The Mahatma, or "great souled one," instigated several campaigns of passive resistance against the British government in India.Unfortunately, according to Webster's Biographical Dictionary, "His policies went beyond his control and resulted . . . in riots and disturbances" and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience "resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment
His policies went beyond his control and resulted . . . in riots and disturbances" and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience "resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment." I am not a proponent of everything Gandhi did, but some of his law breaking was justified because India was then under occupation by a foreign power, and Indians were not able to participate fully in decisions that vitally affected them
It is difficult, however, to justify civil disobedience, non-violent or not, where citizens have full recourse to the ballot box to effect change.Where truly representative governments are safeguarded by constitutional protections of human rights and an independent judiciary to construe those rights, there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group disagrees with it
Where truly representative governments are safeguarded by constitutional protections of human rights and an independent judiciary to construe those rights, there is no excuse for breaking the law because some individual or group disagrees with it.There may be a few cases where the law breaking is well pinpointed and so completely non-invasive of the rights of others that it is difficult to criticize it

At best, demonstrations are overused and boringly uninformative; at worst, they can become the stimuli that lead to law breaking
Demonstrations are particularly apt to degenerate into criminal conduct when they leave the site of the grievance and become mobile.Petty criminals and street people looking for excitement attach themselves like remora to the fringes of the crowd and use the protest as an excuse for rock throwing, auto trashing, arson, window breaking, looting, pocket picking and general hooliganism

I am referring to those young men who chose to disobey their country's call to arms during the Vietnam war and fled to Canada or some other sanctuary to avoid combat.Their cowardly acts of civil disobedience weakened the national fabric and threw additional burdens on those who served honorably in that conflict

The tax increase would cover only part of the estimated $4 billion to $6 billion in total damage caused by the Oct. 17 quake.Aside from as much as $3.45 billion in recently approved federal aid, the state is expected to draw from a gubernatorial emergency fund that currently stands at an estimated $700 million

Special Judge Galloway noted that Givens managed horse-breeding in a businesslike way: He kept detailed accounts, practiced soil conservation, enhanced his experience by consulting experts, spent several hours a day doing chores, and dropped the sideline when his best brood mare died
Yet he took little businesslike care with his cattle: He had no prior experience and didn't seek business counsel about them
It's unclear whether Eastern will succeed in overturning the arbitrator's decision, made in a long-simmering "pay parity" dispute that predates both the carrier's Chapter 11 petition and its 1986 acquisition by Texas Air.All Eastern's previous court efforts to head off the pilots' demands have failed
the law isn't clear on how such an arbitration ruling can affect a company's case.Like any other creditor, the pilots will have to apply to the court for payment of their claim
That may leave a lot of leeway for U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland to decide what, if anything, the pilots actually collect.In August, he issued the ruling that let the pilots pursue their back-pay grievance before the arbitrator
In August, he issued the ruling that let the pilots pursue their back-pay grievance before the arbitrator.The pilots' contract with Eastern calls for a mutually acceptable private arbitrator to resolve such grievances
the company was disappointed by the ruling. "The obligation is totally unwarranted
the pilots were extremely pleased. "This is a blow not only to Eastern but to the creditors committee
Eastern and its creditors are in the final, delicate stages of negotiating a second reorganization plan to pay off the airline's debts.An earlier plan, which had received the creditors' approval in July, fell apart when Eastern changed its business plan
An earlier plan, which had received the creditors' approval in July, fell apart when Eastern changed its business plan.It isn't known whether the pilot claim was figured into either plan
The dispute between Eastern and its pilots is over a "pay parity" clause in the pilots' contract.The clause was part of an agreement in which pilots accepted a substantial pay cut as long as no other labor group got a raise. Shortly after Texas Air took control of Eastern, some Machinists union supervisors received a 20% pay raise.The pilots argued that this triggered a pay raise for them.Eastern has disputed the claim

The pilots argued that this triggered a pay raise for them.Eastern has disputed the claim, but a federal district court, an appeals court and now the arbitrator have all sided with the pilots
The two sides don't even agree about how much money is at issue.The pilots put the amount as high as $100 million, the company at $65 million
Another arbitrator is hearing another pay parity case between Eastern and its pilots, resulting from a similar set of circumstances involving a separate pay raise granted another union.A decision on that case isn't expected before mid-November
Ironically, many of the pilots involved have left Eastern or are still striking the carrier, which filed for bankruptcy protection March 9.About 800 have crossed the picket lines and returned to work

Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide named Mr. Achenbaum, 62, vice chairman of professional services, reporting directly to Carl Spielvogel, chairman and chief executive officer.He joins Nov. 13, dissolving his consulting firm, Canter, Achenbaum Associates
In years past, the ad industry's most distinguished executives didn't hesitate to excorciate Mr. Achenbaum.They have since mellowed
hiring Mr. Achenbaum is a shrewd move for Backer Spielvogel, a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi.Mr. Achenbaum has counted among his clients some of the most visible blue-chip advertisers in the country, including Nissan, Toyota, Seagram and Backer Spielvogel clients Hyundai and J.P. Morgan

At Backer Spielvogel, he will work with clients and potential clients on marketing strategies; aside from agency compensation issues, he helped Nissan, for example, come up with its positioning and pricing for its new Infiniti line

Mr. Achenbaum, who had been considering paring down his firm or merging it with another small consulting outfit, soon agreed.The two men are longtime friends and tennis partners, having met about 25 years ago
Before becoming a consultant in 1974, Mr. Achenbaum was a senior executive at J. Walter Thompson Co.He spent most of his career formulating marketing strategies, but became best-known for chipping away at ad agency compensation
Ad agencies typically earned a straight 15% commission; if a client spent $100 million on TV time, the agency made $15 million
But Mr. Achenbaum pioneered negotiated fees, which often worked out to less than 15%.More recently, he negotiated "indemnification" clauses in which an ad agency in some cases must pay a client if it drops the account
He ultimately became so well-known for cutting compensation, however, that clients didn't seek him out for anything else. "I was very frustrated

Besides holding the promise of safer spinal surgery, the probe could improve the diagnosis of brain and nerve disorders such as strokes and multiple sclerosis.Perhaps most exciting, the device is thrusting open a window to the workings of the brain
The probe, which is painless, non-invasive and apparently harmless, employs strong magnetic fields to induce small whirlwinds of electricity within the brain.If positioned over the brain's motor-control area, the hand-held electromagnets generate nerve impulses that zip down motor nerves and activate muscles, making, say, a finger twitch

Magnetic brain tweaking started in the early 1900s, when researchers produced flashes of light in the visual field with magnets.In the 1960s, Mayo Clinic researchers developed magnetic devices to stimulate motor nerves in the hand and other limbs
Since then, at least two commercial versions have been put on the U.S. market, and an estimated 500 have been sold.In August, a Chicago conference on such devices attracted more than 100 researchers, who reported studies on everything from brain mapping to physical therapy
We don't feel we can use {the devices} routinely in surgery yet, but we're getting close.A problem is that anesthetized brains are more resistant to magnetic stimulation than awake ones
The main sensation, besides feeling like a puppet jerked with invisible strings, is "like a rap on the head.One apparent side effect is a minor increase in a brain hormone
At least two companies, Cadwell Laboratories Inc. of Kennewick, Wash., and Novametrix Medical Systems Inc. of Wallingford, Conn., now sell versions of the magnetic devices.The machines, which at $12,500 are inexpensive by medical standards, haven't been approved in the U.S. for marketing as brain stimulators but are sold for stimulating nerves in the hand, legs and other non-brain areas

Similarly, a Purdue University team led by heart researcher W.A. Tacker hopes to develop ways to magnetically induce cardiac muscle contractions.The devices might someday serve as temporary pacemakers or restarters for stopped hearts
The devices' most remarkable possibilities, though, involve the brain.Probing with the stimulators, National Institutes of Health scientists recently showed how the brain reorganizes motor-control resources after an amputation

The missing watch is emblematic of the problems Mr. Wathen encountered in building his closely held California Plant Protection Security Service into the largest detective and security agency in the U.S. through acquisitions.The ever-optimistic Mr. Wathen has learned that while acquiring a big brand-name company can be a shortcut to growth, it can also bring a host of unforeseen problems
Mr. Wathen built his California Plant Protection from a tiny mom-and-pop security patrol firm here in the San Fernando Valley.He joined the firm in 1963 and bought it from the owners the next year
He joined the firm in 1963 and bought it from the owners the next year.Over the next 20 years, California Plant Protection opened 125 offices around the country
he could easily merge Pinkerton's operations with his own while slashing overhead costs because the two already operated in many of the same cities.He could acquire a staff of loyal Pinkerton's employees, many of whom had spent their entire careers with the firm, he could eliminate a competitor and he could get the name recognition he'd wanted
Mr. Wathen also relished the chance to demonstrate an entrepreneur like himself, who'd spent his whole career in the security business, could run Pinkerton's better than an unfocused conglomerate or investment banker. "The security business is my favorite subject

And regional offices were "egregiously overstaffed.One office had 19 people doing the work of three
The acquisition combined the country's second-largest security company, Pinkerton's, with 1987 sales of $410 million, and the fourth largest, California Plant Protection, with $250 million in sales, creating the industry's biggest firm, which took on the Pinkerton's name.Even after divesting itself of $120 million of unprofitable business, the new Pinkerton's will have sales of about $610 million this year and operating profit roughly double the industry average of 2%-3% of sales, says Lloyd Greif of Sutro & Co. in Los Angeles, which arranged the Pinkerton's acquisition
his turnaround strategy has been simple: just hack away at the fat.He began by closing 120 of the combined companies' 260 offices in two months, eliminating about 31% of the company's 2,500-person adminstrative staff, including more than 100 sales positions

We wouldn't have had to refinance if a lot of the problems hadn't been there.This year the firm will be able to service debt and still turn a modest profit
Now Pinkerton's could become entangled in a protracted legal fracas with its former parent.The company recently filed suit in state court in Los Angeles against American Brands, seeking at least $40 million in damages from the Old Greenwich, Conn.-based company
We have previously had discussions with representatives of Pinkerton's Inc. concerning the {sale of the company} and we concluded that we did not have liability under the contract," says American Brands. "As this is now a litigation matter, we have no further comment
that an inventory of Pinkerton's memorabilia disclosed that one of the watches hadn't been forked over by American Brands. "American Brand's failure to surrender the gold watch has damaged new Pinkerton's in an amount as yet {to be} determined and deprived it of a valuable artifact for which it had bargained
The company is also renewing its emphasis on investigations, particularly undercover investigations for corporations.Although investigations now account for only about 5% of Pinkerton's total revenue, that side of the business has traditionally been the more "glamorous" of the two and it carries historical and sentimental value
American Brands "just had a different approach.Their approach didn't work

Corporate leaders, frustrated by double-digit increases in health-care costs, are beginning to sound like liberal Democrats.Failure to check rising medical costs ultimately could "lead some of us who today are free-market advocates to re-examine our thinking and positions with respect to government-sponsored national health insurance," Arthur Puccini, a General Electric Co. vice president, warned earlier this year
The pocketbook impact of health benefits has driven business and labor to a surprising consensus.Both the AFL-CIO and the National Association of Manufacturers are calling for measures to control rising costs, improve quality and provide care to the 31 million Americans who currently lack health insurance

Nobody knows how deep the cycle is going to be.Depending on how far down you go, it may be difficult to pay off that debt
that a combined operation would allow savings in many ways.The two companies each produce market pulp, containerboard and white paper
The two companies each produce market pulp, containerboard and white paper.That means goods could be manufactured closer to customers, saving shipping costs

Georgia-Pacific, which has suspended its stock-repurchase program, would finance the acquisition with all bank debt, provided by banks led by BankAmerica Corp. Georgia-Pacific owns 349,900 Nekoosa shares and would need federal antitrust clearance to buy more than $15 million worth
For Nekoosa, defense options may be undercut somewhat by the precarious state of the junk-bond market, which limits how much value the target could reach in a debt-financed recapitalization.The company's chairman, Mr. Laidig, and a group of advisers met at the offices of Wachtel Lipton Rosen & Katz, a law firm specializing in takeover defense
its board isn't likely to meet before the week after next to respond to the bid.The board has 10 business days to respond
In addition to the usual array of defenses, including a so-called poison pill and a staggered board, Nekoosa has another takeover defense: a Maine state law barring hostile bidders from merging acquired businesses for five years.Nekoosa is incorporated in Maine
Among companies mentioned by analysts as possible counterbidders for Nekoosa are International Paper, Weyerhaeuser, Canadian Pacific Ltd. and MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. "I'm sure everybody else is putting pencil to paper
International Paper and Weyerhaeuser declined to comment.Canadian Pacific couldn't be reached for comment, and MacMillan Bloedel said it hasn't any plans to make a bid for Nekoosa
Investors were quick to spot other potential takeover candidates, all of which have strong cash flows and low-cost operations.Among paper company stocks that rallied on the Big Board because of the offer were Union Camp, up $2.75 to $37.75, Federal Paperboard, up $1.75 to $27.875, Mead, up $2.375 to $38.75, and Temple Inland Inc., up $3.75 to $62.25

But many analysts believe that, given the attractiveness of paper companies' cash flows, as well as the frantic consolidation of the paper industry in Europe, there will be at least a few more big hostile bids for U.S. companies within the next several months.The buyers, these analysts added, could be either foreign or other U.S.concerns
I don't think anyone is now immune from takeover.Every paper company management has to be saying to itself, `Before someone comes after me, I'm going to go after somebody. '

Indeed, a number of analysts said that Japanese paper companies are hungry to acquire additional manufacturing capacity anywhere in the world.Some predicted that Nekoosa will end up being owned by a Japanese company
Meanwhile, Shearson Lehman's Mr. Devario said that, to stay competitive, the U.S. paper industry needs to catch up with the European industry.Since the most-recent wave of friendly takeovers was completed in the U.S. in 1986, there have been more than 100 mergers and acquisitions within the European paper industry, he said

But the bill still faces budget questions because it also is the vehicle for an estimated $3.1 billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs.The additional spending pushes the measure more than $2 billion above its prescribed budget ceiling

The same jealousy can breed confusion, however, in the absence of any authorization bill this year.House and Senate appropriators sought to establish a Nov. 30 deadline after which their bill would become the last word on how funds are distributed.But on a 53-45 roll call this provision was stripped from the bill last night after Foreign Relations Chairman Claiborne Pell (D., R.I.) complained that it was an intrusion on exclusive powers vested in his panel for more than three decades

A couple of things Mr. Newsom said were at least misleading.federal regulators eventually declared one of the loans the state regulator cited to be a total loss, and forced Lincoln to make an $18 million downward adjustment on another
Our response to the whitewash would simply be, look what happened.Federal officials seized the association in April, a day after the parent corporation entered bankruptcy-law proceedings
that regulators waited far too long, however, ignoring a recommendation from regional officials to place Lincoln into receivership two years before it failed. "He took the reckless course of ignoring the evidence
he found the chief federal examiner Steve Scott to be totally uninterested in one allegedly fraudulent series of transactions. "Frankly, it was like he worked for the Lincoln public-relations department
And David Riley, a federal examiner who worked under Mr. Scott, said he found his chief oddly upbeat about Lincoln.Asked to comment, a spokesman for Mr. Scott said: "Mr.Scott has spoken to his attorney, who has advised him not to talk to anybody
that a day or two before Lincoln's parent entered bankruptcy proceedings, he and other examiners saw "a truck with a sign on it that said it was from the `Document Destruction Center. ' We observed at least two large plastic bags of shredded paper loaded into this truck
Mr. Bickwit said the paper had been donated to "a charitable organization that sells it for recycling.They shredded it simply because it contained financial information about their creditors and depositors
Mr. Meek said his suspicions were aroused by several foreign investments by Lincoln, including $22 million paid to Credit Suisse of Switzerland, an $18 million interest in Saudi European Bank in Paris, a $17.5 million investment in a Bahamas trading company, and a recently discovered holding in a Panama-based company, Southbrook Holdings.Mr. Bickwit said, "I can see why an S&L examiner would regard these as unusual activities," but said the overseas investments "essentially broke even" for the S&L

Second-tier companies are receiving even less per ton.LTV's planned increase, which was announced in an Oct. 26 memo to district managers, doesn't affect electrogalvanized steel or tin plate
the move is designed to more accurately reflect the value of products and to put steel on more equal footing with other commodities.that steel prices, adjusted for inflation, increased only 1.7% between 1981 and the fourth quarter of 1988, while the prices of other industrial commodities increased nearly five times as much
that LTV may be trying to send a signal to major customers, such as Chrysler Corp. and Whirlpool Corp., that steelmakers need more money.Both companies are in the process of negotiating contracts with LTV and others
They {LTV} may believe this can impact contract negotiations and is their signal to the world that now is the time to get tough on prices.Mr. Marcus believes spot steel prices will continue to fall through early 1990 and then reverse themselves

LUTHER BURBANK CROSS-BRED PLANTS to produce the billion-dollar Idaho potato.Bioengineers set out to duplicate that feat -- scientifically and commercially -- with new life forms
In 1953, James Watson and his colleagues unlocked the double helix of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), the genetic key to heredity.Twenty years later, two California academics, Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer, made "recombinant" DNA, transplanting a toad's gene into bacteria, which then reproduced toad genes
When Boyer met Robert Swanson, an M.I.T.-trained chemist-turned-entrepreneur in 1976, they saw dollar signs.With $500 apiece and an injection of outside capital, they formed Genentech Inc

Democrats want to avoid having to make that choice by making the capital-gains tax cut an individual bill.Sen. Mitchell is confident he has sufficient votes to block such a measure with procedural actions
Both plans would drop child-care provisions from the House version of the deficit-reduction legislation and let it progress as a separate bill.While that could make it vulnerable to a veto by Mr. Bush that a presidential rejection would give their party a valuable issue in next year's congressional elections

In a related development it completed a recapitalization in which its controlling shareholders and top officers, Nelson Peltz and Peter W. May, surrendered warrants and preferred stock in exchange for a larger stake in Avery's common shares.On a fully diluted basis, the two raised their stake to 68% from 51%
In December 1988, Messrs.Peltz and May sold their stock in Triangle Industries Inc., a packaging company they controlled, to Pechiney Corp. of France.The executives had profited handsomely by building American National Can Co., Triangle's chief asset

Britain's unsettled political scene also worries some investors. "The gyrations in the British government" add political uncertainty on top of high inflation and a ragged stock market

With this sort of sentiment common, it's natural for investors to seek out "defensive" investments.Utilities are a classic example: Even in recessions, people continue to use electric power, water and gas at a fairly steady rate
Utilities are a classic example: Even in recessions, people continue to use electric power, water and gas at a fairly steady rate
But many of these stocks have now become expensive.Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. as examples: They're selling for 18 to 22 times estimated 1990 per-share earnings
Mr. Wachtel points to Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. as examples: They're selling for 18 to 22 times estimated 1990 per-share earnings
Gold stocks aren't cheap on this basis, either, with many selling for 20 times earnings or more.Even utility stocks aren't all that inexpensive, at an average of 14 times earnings
But the two groups represent a further step in defensiveness.If gold stocks and utilities continue to lead, it may signal that the market is in for rough times
That's just what Joseph Granville expects. "We are going to explode lower
We are going to explode lower.Anyone telling you to buy stocks in this market is technically irresponsible
Anyone telling you to buy stocks in this market is technically irresponsible.You don't want to own anything long except gold stocks
One reason for his gloom is a weekly tally he keeps of stocks within a point of hitting new highs or lows.Last Friday, 96 stocks on the Big Board hit new 12-month lows
Robert Stovall, a veteran New York money manager and president of Stovall/ Twenty-First Securities, has money in both gold and utility issues. "I think we could very well have {an economic} slowdown, beginning very soon if not already
But he does expect "a muffler dragger" of an economy, with "very slow growth, maybe one quarter of no growth at all." In such a climate, utility stocks look good to him
In such a climate, utility stocks look good to him.He favors FPL Group Inc., Florida Progress Corp., TECO Energy Inc., Wisconsin Energy Corp., and Dominion Resources Inc

it makes sense to have some money in both utilities and gold. "My outlook is for a decline of about 10% in corporate profits" in 1990
But "a bunch of utilities" should post profit increases.Among utilities, Drexel currently favors Entergy Corp. and General Public Utilities Corp
As for gold, she notes that it usually rises when the dollar is weak, as it has been lately.Among gold stocks, Drexel likes Battle Mountain Gold Co., Newmont Gold Co. and Freeport-McMoRan Gold Co
It never ceases to amaze me how the business world continues to trivialize the world's environmental problems ("Is Science, or Private Gain, Driving Ozone Policy?" by George Melloan, Business World, Oct. 24).To suggest that a 10% drop in ozone by the middle of the next century would be negligible is irresponsible and shortsighted
To suggest that a 10% drop in ozone by the middle of the next century would be negligible is irresponsible and shortsighted.that a mere 2% drop in ozone would increase birth defects and mutations by allowing solar radiation to alter the DNA structure
that a mere 2% drop in ozone would increase birth defects and mutations by allowing solar radiation to alter the DNA structure.Even a small reduction is unacceptable and to suggest otherwise is penny-wise and pound-foolish
The reason environmentalists "don't mind seeing new crises arise" is because there are new crises.Crises larger and more dangerous to the quality of life than they were 10 years ago
Crises larger and more dangerous to the quality of life than they were 10 years ago.that the Pomton Lakes Reservoirs in northern New Jersey, which supply the tristate area with drinking water, are riddled with toxic PCBs
that the Pomton Lakes Reservoirs in northern New Jersey, which supply the tristate area with drinking water, are riddled with toxic PCBs.This is a fact and not the product of some environmental doomsayer or a group's ploy to create a market
Mr. Melloan's column was right on the money, but I wish it could have gone one step further.As an employee of a major refrigerator and freezer manufacturer, I have been heavily involved in dealing with the political manifestations of the Rowland-Molina theory (named after the researchers who found in 1974 that chlorofluorocarbons contributed to the depletion of ozone in the earth's atmosphere) and the Montreal Protocol
As an employee of a major refrigerator and freezer manufacturer, I have been heavily involved in dealing with the political manifestations of the Rowland-Molina theory (named after the researchers who found in 1974 that chlorofluorocarbons contributed to the depletion of ozone in the earth's atmosphere) and the Montreal Protocol.An important part of my effort has been to understand the science so I can explain it to corporate colleagues facing major changes in product design
Our concern for the ozone layer, of course, grows out of the potential for increasing UV-B radiation, which could damage flora and fauna.The last of the measurements reported was in 1985, but recent conversations with Mr. Scotto indicated that he knew of no recent changes in the trend
that he knew of no recent changes in the trend.that there are studies by Norwegians, Russians and the Max Planck Institute that show either unchanging or declining UV-B at the surface
This, in turn, threatens the massive vested interests of which you have written.My questions on this subject at a recent meeting at the World Resources Institute with representatives of the National Resource Development Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, Friends of the Earth, etc. were greeted with derision and some mumbled comments about that report being discredited
My questions on this subject at a recent meeting at the World Resources Institute with representatives of the National Resource Development Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, Friends of the Earth, etc. were greeted with derision and some mumbled comments about that report being discredited.When I expressed amazement that no one was undertaking a more current and credible UV-B study, I was urged to get back to the agenda topic, which was, ironically, a schedule for getting rid of HCFCs, the so-called soft CFCs that are such an important part of the CFC substitution scenario
But this is almost an underground activity.To my knowledge, no government entities, including the EPA, are pursuing UV-B measurements
To my knowledge, no government entities, including the EPA, are pursuing UV-B measurements.The topic never comes up in ozonedepletion "establishment" meetings, of which I have attended many
that such measurements are a vital part of any intellectually honest evaluation of the threat posed by CFCs.While recognizing that professional environmentalists may feel threatened, I intend to urge that UV-B be monitored whenever I can
The relationship between surface release of CFCs and global stratospheric ozone loss was identified back in 1974.Although, like all scientific theories, it had its initial opponents, few experts question the connection now
Although, like all scientific theories, it had its initial opponents, few experts question the connection now.The discovery of the ozone "hole" over Antarctica and the results of ground-based and high-altitude aircraft experiments conducted over the past several years serve as evidence that ozone depletion is related to CFC concentrations
In the September issue of Scientific American, Thomas E. Graedel, distinguished member of the technical staff at AT&T Bell Laboratories, and Paul J. Crutzen, director of the air chemistry division of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, West Germany, wrote, "It is now quite evident that chlorofluorocarbons, particularly CFC-11 and CFC-12 are the major culprits responsible for ozone depletion." Mr. Melloan quotes Peter Teagan and invokes the name of Arthur D. Little Inc. to support his statement
However, unlike Messrs.Graedel and Crutzen, who are both pioneers in the study of atmospheric chemistry, Mr. Teagan has no special expertise in the area.He is a mechanical engineer, not an atmospheric chemist
It is insulting and demeaning to say that scientists "needed new crises to generate new grants and contracts" and that environmental groups need them to stay in business.Solving the global environmental problems we all face will require an unprecedented level of cooperation and communication among industry, policy makers and the scientific community world-wide
MiniScribe also hasn't filed any financial statements for 1989.such statements should be ready by the end of November

The operative definition of newsworthiness will favor virtually unrestrained use of personal, sensitive and intimate facts.Traditional standards of relevancy and importance ("is this something the public ought to know") will be replaced by a much broader test ("is this something the public is interested in knowing").And, since the public has always been fascinated by gossip and voyeurism, reporters and editors will strain for creative angles to justify the inclusion of collateral facts about private lives including sexual activities and domestic relationships, activities of family members, and all matters about mental and physical health.Similarly, visual images will be more vivid, sensational and, sometimes, gruesome.One consequence of the trend toward tabloid standards of taste will be fierce attacks from politicians who will find sufficient evidence of abuse to arouse an already cynical public to control the press

Over the past two years, the Fed has given a handful of banks' securities affiliates permission to underwrite and deal in a variety of corporate, asset-backed and municipal securities that had previously been the sole domain of securities firms.Securities firms have challenged those Fed approvals, saying they violate federal laws separating the banking and securities businesses

Every workday at 11 a.m., 40-year-old Mike Sinyard dons cycling clothes, hops on a bike he keeps at his Morgan Hill, Calif., office and sets out to cover a distance most people would travel only by car.As many as 50 of his employees at Specialized Bicycle Components Inc. ride with him
As many as 50 of his employees at Specialized Bicycle Components Inc. ride with him.When they return to their desks at 1 p.m., they have pedaled 20 miles

With 65% of its sales coming from mountain bikes, Specialized is widely considered to be a market leader. (Accessories, largely for mountain-bike users, account for much of the rest of sales
But today, the company needs its entrepreneurial spirit more than ever.One large competitor after another is leaping into the booming market Specialized helped create, turning out mountain bikes with such well-known names as Schwinn, Peugeot, Raleigh and Nishiki
Thus, Mr. Sinyard's company must innovate more than ever to stay ahead of them, by developing new products specifically for mountain biking.At the same time, though, it must become more structured to better manage its growth.Accomplishing both will be a balancing act as challenging as riding a unicycle
It is a problem common to small companies that have grown fast -- especially when their success attracts big-time competitors. "The big word around Specialized is passion," says Erik Eidsmo, a former ski-industry executive whom Mr. Sinyard recruited from Citicorp to run marketing and sales

While the company's sales were soaring, "We still had a system that was probably appropriate for $10 million to $20 million in sales.What felt good that day was done that day
Since his arrival in May, Mr. Eidsmo has put in place techniques learned while working for Citicorp, such as management-by-objective, detailed project plans and forecasts of company sales and product trends. "We're finally getting -- and it's been very painful -- some understanding of what the company's long-term horizon should begin to look like
But it's risky.You don't want to lose the magic" of the company's creative drive
Hoping to stay ahead of the pack, the company is emphasizing innovation.At a recent trade show, convention-goers lined up to view a new Specialized bike frame that weighs just 2.7 pounds -- a pound less than the lightest mountain-bike frame on the market

At the trade show, Specialized also unveiled a revolutionary three-spoked bike wheel developed jointly by Specialized and Du Pont Co. Made of space-age materials, the wheel spokes are designed like airplane wings to shave 10 minutes off the time of a rider in a 100-mile race, the company claims

But "the Soviet Union has areas where it isn't behind Japan.We have obtained through the development of Cosmos {the Soviet space program} technologies you don't see anywhere else
The sales pitch mightn't be as farfetched as it seems.Japan-U.S. trade relations are bumpy these days, and some Japanese favor decreasing their reliance on U.S. technology in light of the FSX fighter-plane flap, when U.S. officials reversed an earlier decision and refused to share certain crucial fighter-plane technology

MAY 1, 1975, SIGNALED A DISTRESSFUL May Day for securities houses, which were forced to end 183 years of charging fixed commissions.It scared brokers, but most survived
It took effect after seven years of bitter debate between the Securities and Exchange Commission and traders and exchanges.Despite warnings from such leaders as former Federal Reserve Board Chairman William McChesney Martin that unfixed commissions would undo the industry, the SEC in September 1973 said full competition must start May l, 1975
The timing for change was right.Institutions had become active market players in the early 1970s and sought exchange seats to handle their own trades
Within three weeks of the 1975 end to fixed rates there were all-out price wars among brokers fighting for institutional business, with rate slashes of 35% to 60% below pre-May 1 levels.the "breadth and depth of the discounting is more than I expected
the "breadth and depth of the discounting is more than I expected." Even a federal measure in June allowing houses to add research fees to their commissions didn't stop it

Mr. Azoff and Warner came to an agreement yesterday to form a 50-50 joint-venture company funded by Warner and run by Mr. Azoff.Among other things Mr. Azoff would develop musical acts for a new record label
to be similar to Warner's 50-50 partnership with record and movie producer David Geffen, whose films and records are distributed by the Warner Bros. studio and the Warner records unit.Although Mr. Azoff won't produce films at first, it is possible that he could do so later
Like Mr. Geffen's arrangement, the venture gives Mr. Azoff a link to the world's largest and most successful record distributor; in the U.S. alone, Warner has a 40% share of the market, about double its nearest competitor, Sony Corp. 's CBS Records
But Mr. Azoff had been negotiating for more than a year to get out of his MCA contract.Mr. Azoff was bored and frequently clashed with top MCA management over a number of issues such as compensation and business plans

Democracy is making a return with a vengeance to Latin America's most populous and deeply indebted country.On Nov. 15, when Brazilians elect a president for the first time in 29 years, the country's 82 million voters will have 22 candidates to choose from

The favorite remains Fernando Collor de Mello, a 40-year-old former governor of the state of Alagoas.He came out of nowhere to grab the lead in opinion polls, probably less because of his vague program to "build a new Brazil" than because of his good looks, the open backing of the powerful Rede Globo television network and his reputation as a hunter of "maharajahs," or overpaid and underworked civil servants
But after building up a commanding lead, the moderate to conservative Mr. Collor has slipped to about 30% in the polls from a high of about 43% only a few weeks ago.To avoid a runoff, one candidate would have to win 50% of the vote -- a feat that most analysts consider impossible with so many candidates running

Despite valiant efforts by Finance Minister Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega, inflation came to 36% in September alone and is expected to top 1,000% for the year.That might have been considered hyperinflation not long ago, but Argentina endured price increases of almost 200% in July before bringing the rate down sharply in August and September
Still, massive internal debt has forced the government to borrow massively on the domestic market and to offer inflation-adjusted returns of 2% to 3% a month just to get investors to hold on to its paper.About $70 billion is estimated to be tied up in the short-term money market, which acts both as a hedge against inflation for consumers and an accelerator of inflation and deficits for the government

Secretary of State Baker, we read, decided to kill a speech that Robert Gates, deputy national security adviser and a career Soviet expert, was going to give to a student colloquium, the National Collegiate Security Conference.We keep wondering what Mr. Gates wanted to say
Perhaps he might have cited Mr. Gorbachev's need for "a stable currency, free and competitive markets, private property and real prices" and other pie-in-the-sky reforms.Perhaps he'd have called for "a decentralized political and economic system" without a dominant communist party
If Mr. Gates had been allowed to say these things, we would now be hearing about "discord" and "disarray" on foreign policy.Dark hints would be raised that parts of the administration hope Mr. Gorbachev would fail, just as they were when Vice President Quayle voiced similar sentiments
In fact, he did; the quotes above are from Mr. Baker's speech of two weeks ago
So far as we can see, there is no disagreement among Mr. Baker, Mr. Quayle, the Mr. Gates we've read, or for that matter President Bush.They all understand point one: Nothing the U.S. can do will make much difference in whether Mr. Gorbachev succeeds with perestroika

Two gunmen entered a Maryland restaurant, ordered two employees to lie on the floor and shot them in the backs of their heads.The killers fled with less than $100
Sen. Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.) recently urged fellow lawmakers to revive a broad federal death penalty. "The ultimate punishment will protect the law-abiding from the vicious, cruel individuals who commit these crimes
The law that Sen. Thurmond is pushing would be irrelevant in the case of the Maryland restaurant murders and almost all other killings.Most murders are state crimes
Yet the bill is riding high on the furor over drug trafficking.Senate Republicans, after repeatedly failing to attach death-penalty amendments to unrelated legislation, have finally gotten a full-blown death-penalty bill through committee
Senate Republicans have finally gotten a full-blown death-penalty bill through committee.The Democratic leadership agreed to allow a floor vote on the issue before the end of the year
The Democratic leadership agreed to allow a floor vote on the issue before the end of the year -- a debate certain to focus on the alleged racial inequality of death sentencing.Even some Democrats concede that there is probably a majority in the Senate that favors some kind of broad capital-punishment measure
The pending bill, introduced by Mr. Thurmond, would revive the long-dormant federal death-penalty laws by instituting legal procedures required by the Supreme Court.In 1972, the high court swept aside all capital-punishment laws -- federal and state alike -- as unconstitutional
But in 1976, the court permitted resurrection of such laws, if they meet certain procedural requirements.Since that 1976 ruling, 37 states have reintroduced the death penalty
The Thurmond bill would establish a federally administered death sentence for 23 crimes.Among these crimes are murder on federal land, presidential assassination and espionage
For one thing, it's unlikely that many people would receive federal death sentences, let alone be executed.Most of the crimes incorporated in the Thurmond bill are exceedingly rare
In fact, only 28 defendants would have been eligible for federal death sentences if the Thurmond bill had been in effect in the past three years, according to a study by the Senate Judiciary Committee's Democratic staff.The last federal execution before the Supreme Court's 1972 ruling banning the death penalty took place in 1963, meaning that the federal government didn't exercise its execution authority for eight years
In that sense, the whole debate is sort of a fraud.It's distracting attention from serious issues
but that isn't the point.that the mere existence of the penalty deters many people from the commission of capital crimes
Executions, regardless of how frequently they occur, are also "proper retribution" for heinous crimes, Mr. Hatch argues.Thomas Boyd, a senior Justice Department official, says the new federal drug-related crimes punishable by death since last November may result in a jump in capital sentences, though that hasn't happened so far
this bill has made race a major part of the death-penalty debate.Before the bill left committee, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) attached an amendment that would allow a defendant to escape from a death sentence in jurisdictions shown to have meted out executions in a racist manner. The amendment prompted an ironic protest from Mr. Thurmond, who complained that it would "kill" capital punishment
The amendment prompted an ironic protest from Mr. Thurmond, who complained that it would "kill" capital punishment.A large number of studies suggest that state judges and juries have imposed the penalty in a racially discriminatory fashion
And the Kennedy amendment would invade not only federal but state sentencings, in two important ways.It would allow all defendants to introduce statistical evidence showing racially disproportionate application of the death penalty in the past
That burden is very difficult, if not impossible, to meet.How do you prove a negative
How do you prove a negative?" Since most prosecutors wouldn't be able to demonstrate conclusively that racial considerations didn't affect sentencing, executions everywhere might come to a halt
At least 15 major studies purport to show that particular states have imposed the death penalty disproportionately against killers of whites compared with blacks, and against black defendants compared with white defendants.Conservatives question the validity of the studies and note that the Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that such research, regardless of its accuracy, isn't relevant to a constitutional attack on a particular death sentence
The Kennedy amendment would, in effect, legislate around the Supreme Court ruling.Lawyers would eagerly seize on the provision in their death-penalty appeals
But if it survives, it could prompt other statutory changes.It might force Congress and the states to narrow the death penalty only to convictions shown to be relatively free of racial imbalance
Vice Chancellor Maurice A. Hartnett III of Delaware's Court of Chancery heard arguments for more than two hours here, but he made no comment and asked no questions.He could rule as early as today on the motion seeking a temporary injunction against the Dow Jones offer

Revco reacted cautiously, saying the plan would add $260 million of new debt to the highly leveraged company.It was Revco's huge debt from its $1.3 billion leveraged buy-out in 1986 that forced it to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code
Revco insists that the proposal is simply an "expression of interest," because under Chapter 11 Revco has "exclusivity rights" until Feb. 28.Those rights prevent anyone other than Revco from proposing a reorganization plan
Also under Chapter 11, a reorganization plan is subject to approval by bondholders, banks and other creditors.A financial adviser for Revco bondholders, David Schulte, of Chilmark Partners, had mixed reactions to the offer
However, the group is offering to pay off bondholders in cash only -- $260.5 million -- and no equity.The Revco bonds are high-yield, high-risk "junk" bonds; holders have $750 million in claims against Revco, Mr. Schulte said

Acadia Partners and the Bass Group declined to comment.The partnership also includes American Express Co., Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc
The offer consists of $410.5 million in cash and the rest in notes.Acadia would sell up to 10% of the equity in the reorganized company to creditors and bondholders in exchange for the cash distribution, but creditors and bondholders would receive no discount for their shares
He said he has not met with representatives from Acadia.Any reorganization proposal, Mr. Sells said, is difficult to assess because it must be agreed upon by the company, bondholders, banks and other creditors

Copper futures prices failed to extend Friday's rally.Declines came because of concern that demand for copper may slow down

The reluctance of traders to buy contracts indicates that they have begun focusing on demand rather than supply.that as production improves, the concern among traders is whether the prospective increased supply will find buyers because of uncertainty over national economies
Japan normally depends heavily on the Highland Valley and Cananea mines as well as the Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea.Recently, Japan has been buying copper elsewhere
But as Highland Valley and Cananea begin operating, they are expected to resume their roles as Japan's suppliers.According to Fred Demler, metals economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert, New York, "Highland Valley has already started operating and Cananea is expected to do so soon
The Bougainville mine is generally expected to remain closed until at least the end of the year.It hasn't been operating since May 15 because of attacks by native landowners

Workers at two Chilean mines, Los Bronces and El Soldado, which belong to the Exxon-owned Minera Disputado group, will vote Thursday on whether to strike after a two-year labor pact ends today.The mines produced a total of 110,000 tons of copper in 1988
According to Drexel's Mr. Demler, the potential strike is expected to be resolved quickly, which may be one reason why the situation didn't affect prices much.that, if there was any concern, it was that a strike could encourage other walkouts in Chile
that stocks of copper in U.S. producers' hands at the end of September were down 16,000 metric tons from August to 30,000 tons.Outside the U.S. producer stocks at the end of August were 273,000 tons, down 3,000 tons from the end of July
and stocks of copper held by consumers and merchants outside of the U.S. at the end of July stood at 123,000 tons, down from 125,000 tons in June.The high point of foreigners' copper stocks this year was 136,000 tons at the end of April, according to Mr. Demler
The prices of most corn, soybean and wheat futures contracts dropped slightly as farmers in the Midwest continued to rebuild stockpiles that were depleted by the 1988 drought.Buying by the Soviets has helped to prop up corn prices in recent weeks, but a lack of any new purchases kept prices in the doldrums
Futures prices rose slightly in a market filled with rumors that a new international coffee agreement might still be achieved.The December contract ended with a gain of 1.29 cents a pound at 74.35 cents
The December contract ended with a gain of 1.29 cents a pound at 74.35 cents.According to one analyst, prices opened higher because of reports over the weekend that Brazil and Colombia had agreed to a reduction in their coffee export quotas for the sake of creating a new agreement
that Brazil and Colombia had agreed to a reduction in their coffee export quotas for the sake of creating a new agreement.Brazil would give up 500,000 bags of its quota and Colombia 200,000 bags
The reports said Brazil would give up 500,000 bags of its quota and Colombia 200,000 bags.These reports were later denied by a high Brazilian official
who said Brazil wasn't involved in any coffee discussions on quotas.The Colombian minister was said to have referred to a letter that he said President Bush sent to Colombian President Virgilio Barco, and in which President Bush said it was possible to overcome obstacles to a new agreement

When the Supreme Soviet passed laws on workers' rights in May 1987 and on self-managing cooperatives a year later, some Western observers assumed Mikhail Gorbachev had launched the Soviet Union on a course that would lead inevitably to the creation of a market economy.Their only doubt concerned the possibility that Mr. Gorbachev might not survive the opposition that his reforms would arouse and that the whole process might be reversed
If Mr. Gorbachev's goal is the creation of a free market, he and these Western observers have good reason to fear for his future, as economic liberalization within communist societies leads inexorably to demands for fundamental political reform accompanied by civil unrest.These fears were clearly apparent when, last week, Secretary of State James Baker blocked a speech by Robert Gates, deputy national security adviser and Soviet expert, on the ground that it was too pessimistic about the chances of Mr. Gorbachev's economic reforms succeeding
For example, while the laws on individual labor activity allow a citizen to earn a living independent of the state, strict provisions are attached on how far this may lead to the development of a free market.Before becoming self-employed, or setting up a cooperative, workers must seek permission from the local soviet (council
Before becoming self-employed, or setting up a cooperative, workers must seek permission from the local soviet (council).Permission is far from automatic
Permission is far from automatic: The soviets have the legal right to turn down applications and impose conditions, and they appear to be exercising these powers
Private dressmaking, for example, is allowed in 10 Soviet republics but banned by five; shoemaking is allowed in seven but illegal in nine
All independent media activity is now illegal, which perhaps is not surprising, but so is the manufacture of perfume, cosmetics, household chemicals and sand candles.Medical cooperatives, among the most successful in the U.S.S.R., are banned from providing general-practitioner services (their main source of income), carrying out surgery, and treating cancer patients, drug addicts and pregnant women
The first enables the soviets to set prices for which goods may be sold; the second bans cooperatives from buying "industrial and food goods" from the state or other cooperatives
Earlier this month, the Supreme Soviet adopted two more resolutions restricting the freedom of cooperatives: The first enables the soviets to set prices for which goods may be sold; the second bans cooperatives from buying "industrial and food goods" from the state or other cooperatives.If Mr. Gorbachev is looking toward unleashing the productive forces of the market, these latest resolutions are nothing short of reckless
Along with some other revealing indicators, these developments suggest that while Mr. Gorbachev wishes to move away from some rigid central controls, he is bent on creating economic structures of a kind that would scarcely find favor with the Austrian or Chicago schools of economic thought.Mr. Gorbachev has ruled out the use of the market to solve the problem of insufficient consumer goods
Mr. Gorbachev has ruled out the use of the market to solve the problem of insufficient consumer goods.He told the Congress of People's Deputies on May 30: "We do not share this approach, since it would immediately destroy the social situation and disrupt all the processes in the country
that would combine the discipline and controls of the former with the economic benefits of the latter.Most important, this would leave the party intact and its monopoly of political power largely undisturbed
The emergence of Russian corporatism had been anticipated in journalist George Urban's introduction to a series of colloquies -- "Can the Soviet System Survive Reform?" -- published this spring. "Communism will reach its final stage of development in a feckless Russo -- corporation-socialist in form, nationalistic in content and Oriental in style -- that will puzzle the world with alternating feats of realism and recklessness
The fascist concept of corporatism envisaged an "organic" society in which citizens were spiritually and morally unified, and prepared to sacrifice themselves for the nation.This unification was to be brought about through policies and institutions that would unite workers and employers with government in a fully integrated and "harmonic" society
This unification was to be brought about through policies and institutions that would unite workers and employers with government in a fully integrated and "harmonic" society.The key to the creation of the "organic" state lay in the formation of "natural" groups that would undertake the role of decision-making
The closeness of Soviet perestroika to the fascist social blueprint of Mussolini was evident when Mr. Gorbachev presented his economic vision to the Soviet Congress.In doing so, he neither rejected a socialist planned economy nor embraced the free market
Instead, he proposed a "law-governed economy," in which there would be a "clear-cut division between state direction of the economy and economic management." The latter would be undertaken by "enterprises, joint stock companies and cooperatives
The latter would be undertaken by "enterprises, joint stock companies and cooperatives." These would not function independently, but would act together to form "combines, unions and associations" to tackle problems and coordinate their activities
Mr. Gorbachev is in a much stronger position to pursue the corporatist ideal than was Mussolini.The Soviet Communist Party has the power to shape corporate development and mold it into a body dependent upon it
At the same time, he must give it sufficient freedom to provide the economic benefits so desperately needed.It is the promise of economic returns that is supposed to make the corporatist model attractive to both the party and labor
The work force provides the third arm of the "alliance." Within the alliance it is supposed to act as a balancing force, guarding against excessive control by government or abuse of its economic position by business, for either could result in a deterioration of its living standards (under the new resolutions, workers councils may demand that a cooperative be closed or its prices be reduced)
Within the alliance it is supposed to act as a balancing force, guarding against excessive control by government or abuse of its economic position by business, for either could result in a deterioration of its living standards (under the new resolutions, workers councils may demand that a cooperative be closed or its prices be reduced).By providing workers with the opportunity to move into the private sector where wages tend to be higher, and by holding out the promise of more consumer goods, Mr. Gorbachev hopes to revive the popularity of the party
At the same time, the strategy requires that he deal effectively with those who seek genuine Western-style political pluralism.The most important development in Mr. Gorbachev's policy for marginalizing the opposition movement is the claim that the U.S.S.R. also suffers from terrorism
The most important development in Mr. Gorbachev's policy for marginalizing the opposition movement is the claim that the U.S.S.R. also suffers from terrorism.An increasing number of references by the Soviet press to opposition groups now active in the U.S.S.R., particularly the Democratic Union, allege that they show "terroristic tendencies
An increasing number of references by the Soviet press to opposition groups now active in the U.S.S.R., particularly the Democratic Union, allege that they show "terroristic tendencies" and claim that they would be prepared to kill in order to achieve their aims.It is possible that, in perpetuating such myths, the ground is being laid for the arrest of opposition activists on the ground of terrorism
Mr. Gorbachev would appear to see his central task, however, as that of ensuring that foundations of an alliance among labor, capital and the state are properly laid before the demands for a multiparty system reach a crescendo.If he were able to construct a popular and efficient corporatist system, he or his heir would be wellplaced to rein in political opposition, and to re-establish control in Eastern Europe
The weaknesses in his plan do not lie in the political calculations but in its economic prescription.Contrary to widespread belief, Mussolini failed to live up to his promise to make the trains run on time
Contrary to widespread belief, Mussolini failed to live up to his promise to make the trains run on time; it is doubtful whether Soviet-style corporatism will make Soviet trains run on time, or fill the shops with goods that the consumers so desperately crave

This action will continue to keep operating expenses in line" with revenue, said J. David Hann, president and chief executive officer of Los Angeles-based Quotron.The move by the financial information and services subsidiary of Citicorp is a "response to changing conditions in the retail securities industry, which has been contracting" since October 1987's stock market crash, the executive added
Independent providers of financial information, including Quotron, have been under some pressure as the major securities houses try to regain their hold on the production of market data and on the related revenue.Shearson, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Morgan Stanley & Co. and Salomon Inc. are discussing formation of a group to sell securities-price data
The job cuts, to be made in a number of areas at various job levels, are "a streamlining of operations.The company has no immediate plans to close any operations

The sweep by the A's, whose pitchers and home-run hitters dominated the injury-prone Giants, will only make things worse for ABC, owned by Capital Cities/ABC Inc.The network had been expected to have losses of as much as $20 million on baseball this year
It isn't clear how much those losses may widen because of the short Series.Had the contest gone a full seven games, ABC could have reaped an extra $10 million in ad sales on the seventh game alone, compared with the ad take it would have received for regular prime-time shows
ABC, in anticipation of a four-game sweep, limited its losses by jacking up the number of commercials it aired in the third and fourth games.A World Series telecast typically carries 56 30-second commercials, but by the fourth game ABC was cramming in 60 to 62 ads to generate extra revenue

and so "keyboard allergy," especially among older workers, remains a common affliction. "I have no experience before with such sophisticated machinery," says Matsuo Toshimitsu, a 66-year-old executive vice president of Japan Air Lines

From a reading of the somewhat scant English-language medical literature on RU-486, the French abortion pill emerges as one of the creepiest concoctions around.This is not only because it kills the unborn, a job at which it actually is not outstandingly efficient, zapping only 50% to 85% of them depending on which study you read (prostaglandin, taken in conjunction with the pill, boosts the rate to 95%).By contrast, surgical abortion is 99% effective. Abortion via the pill is far more of an ordeal than conventional surgical abortion.It is time-consuming (the abortion part alone lasts three days, and the clinical part comprises a week's worth of visits), bloody (one woman in a Swedish trial required a transfusion, although for most it resembles a menstrual period, with bleeding lasting an average of 10 days), and painful (many women require analgesic shots to ease them through).Nausea and vomiting are other common side effects. Timing is of the essence with RU-486.It is most effective taken about a week after a woman misses her menstrual period up through the seventh week of pregnancy, when it is markedly less effective.That is typically about a three-week window. So far, all the studies have concluded that RU-486 is "safe." But "safe," in the definition of Marie Bass of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project, means "there's been no evidence so far of mortality." No one has researched the long-term effects of RU-486 on a woman's health or fertility. The drug seems to suppress ovulation for three to seven months after it is taken.Some women clearly have no trouble eventually conceiving again: The studies have reported repeaters in their programs.But there are no scientific data on this question. Rather ominously, rabbit studies reveal that RU-486 can cause birth defects, Lancet, the British medical journal, reported in 1987.However, Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu, the French physician who invented RU-486, wrote in a Science magazine article last month that the rabbit-test results could not be duplicated in rats and monkeys.The drug has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of DES, the anti-miscarriage drug that has been linked to cervical and vaginal cancer in some of the daughters of the women who took it

Some abortion advocates have been asking themselves this very question.RU-486 "probably represents a technical advance in an area where none is needed, or at least not very much," said Phillip Stubblefield, president of the National Abortion Federation, at a reproductive health conference in 1986
RU-486 "probably represents a technical advance in an area where none is needed, or at least not very much," said Phillip Stubblefield, president of the National Abortion Federation, at a reproductive health conference in 1986.Many physicians have expressed concern over the heavy bleeding, which occurs even if the drug fails to induce an abortion
In the year since the pill went on the French market, the National Organization for Women and its offshoot, former NOW President Eleanor Smeal's Fund for a Feminist Majority, have been trying to browbeat the U.S. pharmaceutical industry into getting involved.

For a woman whose period is late, using RU-486 means no waiting, no walking past picket lines at abortion clinics, and no feet up in stirrups for surgery," burbles health writer Laura Fraser.

At the behest of pro-choice members of Congress, a four-year reauthorization bill for Title X federal family-planning assistance now contains a $10 million grant for "development, evaluation and bringing to the marketplace of new improved contraceptive devices, drugs and methods."

The Commerce Department found that U.S. exports in 1988, net of imports, were understated by $20.9 billion a year and understated at the annualized rate of $25.4 billion in the first quarter of 1989.More than half of the "newly found" net exports were from just a few service-sector categories
More than half of the "newly found" net exports were from just a few service-sector categories.Some of the biggest service-industry exporters have yet to be fully included in our export statistics
Nearly 10 years ago, representatives of service-sector companies worked out a plan with the Commerce Department to improve the data on service-sector exports.Both groups believed that tens of billions of dollars of service exports were not being counted as exports
The monthly "trade deficit" figure is limited to traditional merchandise trade: manufactured goods and raw materials.In the quarterly balance-of-payments report, those merchandise trade figures are merged with statistics on exports and imports of services, as well as returns on investments abroad by Americans and returns on foreign investments in the U.S
Over time, through benchmark surveys, the corrected data on service exports and imports have been gathered.The first three major areas of the service sector to be revamped were expenditures by foreign students in the U.S. (net after expenditures by Americans studying abroad), some exports by professional firms (a law firm billing a German client for services rendered in watching legislation in Washington is as much an export as shipment of an American jet engine), and improved data from travel and tourism
Combined with recalculations and revisions in other trade areas, the value of U.S. net exports that had not previously been recorded was about $20 billion a year.That means that the U.S. trade deficit was running closer to $75 billion than to $95 billion in 1988, and $55 billion (annualized) rather than $80 billion in the first quarter of 1989
These revised figures also may explain some of the recent strength of the dollar.The materially smaller trade deficit may have been already discounted in the market
Too early to tell, but a trade deficit that is significantly smaller than we imagined does suggest a review of our trade posture.It does not relieve the need for our market-opening efforts for both goods and services, but it does suggest that it is our exports of services, and not just borrowing, that is financing our imports of goods
Under a merger agreement reached Sept. 14, the UAL board agreed to reimburse certain of the buy-out group's expenses out of company funds even if the transaction wasn't completed, provided the group didn't breach the agreement.The failure to obtain financing doesn't by itself constitute a breach
The buy-out group is also entitled to $16 million to repay a fund created by the pilots union for an employee stock ownership plan.In addition to the $8 million for Citicorp and Chase, Salomon Brothers is also owed $3 million for promising to make a $200 million bridge loan

The decision by Merrill, the nation's largest securities firm, represents the biggest retreat yet from program trading.Merrill has been the fourth-biggest stock-index arbitrage trader on the Big Board this year, executing an average of 18.1 million shares a month in such trades, or about one million shares a day
Merrill's move is one of the most sweeping program-trading pullbacks of recent days, because the big securities firm will no longer execute stock-index arbitrage trades for customers.Most Wall Street firms, in pulling back, have merely stopped such trading for their own accounts
Merrill has been one of the main firms executing index arbitrage for customers.Merrill also said it is lobbying for significant regulatory controls on program trading
In stock-index arbitrage, traders buy and sell large amounts of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures and options.The idea is to lock in profits from short-term swings in volatile markets
Last Thursday, PaineWebber Group Inc. also said it would cease index arbitrage altogether, but the firm wasn't as big an index arbitrager as Merrill is.Other large firms, including Bear, Stearns & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co., last week announced a pullback from index arbitrage, but only for the firms' own accounts

Just a week ago, Mr. Carpenter staunchly defended index arbitrage at Kidder, the most active index-arbitrage trading firm on the stock exchange this year.Index arbitrage, Mr. Carpenter said last week, doesn't have a "negative impact on the market as a whole" and Kidder's customers were "sophisticated" enough to know that
big institutional investors, which he wouldn't identify, "told us they wouldn't do business with firms" that continued to do index arbitrage for their own accounts. "We were following the trend of our competitors who were under pressure from institutions
Kidder so far this year has executed a monthly average of 37.8 million shares in index-arbitrage trading.Most of Kidder's program trading is for its own account, according to the New York Stock Exchange
But at least one chief executive said he called Mr. Welch to complain about Kidder's aggressive use of program trading, and other market sources said they understood that Mr. Welch received many phone calls complaining about Kidder's reliance on index arbitrage as a major business.Kidder has generally been sensitive to suggestions that GE makes decisions for its Kidder unit

An ancient red-figured Greek kylix, or drinking cup, was recovered backstage at Sotheby's this spring and has been returned to the Manhattan couple who lost it in a burglary three years ago.Robert Guy, an associate curator at the Princeton Art Museum, was previewing a June antiquities sale at the auction house when he recognized the kylix, which he, as a specialist in Attic pottery and a careful reader of the Stolen Art Alert in "IFAR Reports," knew was stolen.The timing of his visit was fortuitous; the man who had brought it in for an estimate had returned to collect it and was waiting in the hall.To confirm Mr. Guy's identification, Sotheby's and IFAR exchanged photos by fax, and the waiting man, apparently innocent of knowledge that the kylix was stolen, agreed to release it.The cup had been insured, and in short order it was given over to a Chubb & Son representative.The original owners happily repaid the claim and took their kylix home

The ruling also may determine how quickly LTV is able to complete its Chapter 11 reorganization.LTV filed for protection under Chapter 11 in federal bankruptcy court in 1986
LTV filed for protection under Chapter 11 in federal bankruptcy court in 1986.The filing was partly the result of the $2.3 billion shortfall in LTV's three pension plans operated for its LTV Steel Co. subsidiary's employees
In January 1987, as LTV Steel continued operating while under reorganization, the agency terminated the three LTV pension plans to keep its insurance liability from increasing.Termination means that the agency's insurance assumes the liabilities and pays the pension benefits already owed under the plans, but workers don't accrue new benefits
A few months later, under pressure from the United Steelworkers of America, LTV instituted a new program to provide retirement benefits similar to those in the terminated plans.Because the federal pension agency had taken over the old plans, LTV would be responsible only for benefits paid under the new pension plans
The agency also concluded that LTV's financial status had improved while it was under reorganization.In September 1987, it ordered LTV to reassume liability and funding for the three original plans
In May, a federal appeals court in New York agreed that the agency acted unlawfully.The appeals court said there was no evidence that Congress intended to allow the pension agency to consider a company's creation of new benefit plans as a basis for ordering that company to reassume liability for old plans
that it was disappointed that the court agreed to hear the case because the move will further delay its Chapter 11 proceedings.The company hasn't been able to come up with a reorganization plan, in part, because of the sizable disagreement with the pension agency
But LTV, a steel, aerospace and energy concern, said it is confident that the Supreme Court will uphold the lower-court decisions and said it expects to continue discussions with the agency about a settlement while the case is being reviewed. (Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. vs.LTV Corp

Scientists say the discovery of these genes in recent months is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer develops.An emerging understanding of the genes is expected to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention
That is for the future.Already, scientists are developing tests based on the newly identified genes that, for the first time, can predict whether an otherwise healthy individual is likely to get cancer
It's a super-exciting set of discoveries.Only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the molecular level
Only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing at the molecular level.Today, we know that the accumulation of several of these altered genes can initiate a cancer and, then, propel it into a deadly state
Scientists call the new class of genes tumor-suppressors, or simply anti-cancer genes.When functioning normally, they make proteins that hold a cell's growth in check
The newly identified genes differ from a family of genes discovered in the early 1980s called oncogenes.Oncogenes must be present for a cell to become malignant, but researchers have found them in normal as well as in cancerous cells, suggesting that oncogenes don't cause cancer by themselves
that oncogenes don't cause cancer by themselves.the two types of cancer genes work in concert: An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged
In recent months, researchers have come to believe the two types of cancer genes work in concert: An oncogene may turn proliferating cells malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene has been damaged
so for cancer to arise, both copies must be impaired.A person who is born with one defective copy of a suppressor gene, or in whom one copy is damaged early in life, is especially prone to cancer
Bill and Bonnie Quinlan are among the first beneficiaries of the new findings.The Dedham, Mass., couple knew even before Bonnie became pregnant in 1987 that any child of theirs had a 50% chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma, an eye cancer that occurs about once every 20,000 births
The Dedham, Mass., couple knew even before Bonnie became pregnant in 1987 that any child of theirs had a 50% chance of being at risk for retinoblastoma.he carried a damaged gene, having lost an eye to the rare tumor when he was only two months old
Because of the isolation of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene, it became possible last January to find out what threat the Quinlan baby faced.A test using new "genetic probes" showed that little Will Quinlan had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene and, therefore, faced no more risk than other children of developing the rare cancer

Equally important, the initial discovery of the gene that controls retinal cell growth, made by a Boston doctor named Thaddeus Dryja, has opened a field of cancer study, which in recent months has exploded.

It turns out that studying a tragic but uncommon tumor made possible some fundamental insights about the most basic workings of cancer.this basic research will begin showing results there soon
To date, scientists have fingered two of these cancer-suppressors.Dr. Dryja made his retinoblastoma discovery in 1986
Soon after that report, two other research teams uncovered evidence that the same damaged p53 gene is present in tissue from lung and breast cancers.Colon, lung and breast cancers are the most common and lethal forms of the disease, collectively killing almost 200,000 Americans a year
Right now about a dozen laboratories, in the U.S., Canada and Britain, are racing to unmask other suspected tumor-suppressing genes.They have about seven candidates
They have about seven candidates.Researchers say the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes, alone or in combination, appears crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain, the skin, kidney, prostate, and cervix
the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes, alone or in combination, appears crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain, the skin, kidney, prostate, and cervix.that if people inherit defective versions of these genes, they are especially prone to cancer, perhaps explaining, finally, why some cancers seem to haunt certain families
The story of tumor-suppressor genes goes back to the 1970s, when a pediatrician named Alfred G. Knudson Jr. proposed that retinoblastoma stemmed from two separate genetic defects.He theorized that in the eye cancer, an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other
that in the eye cancer, an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other.The tumor developed when the second, normal copy also was damaged
Back then, scientists had no way of ferreting out specific genes, but under a microscope they could see the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that contain the genes.Occasionally, gross chromosome damage was visible
Occasionally, gross chromosome damage was visible.Dr. Knudson found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No. 13 from a parent who had had the disease
Dr. Knudson found that some children with the eye cancer had inherited a damaged copy of chromosome No. 13 from a parent who had had the disease.Under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing
Under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 was missing.He assumed the missing piece contained a gene or genes whose loss had a critical role in setting off the cancer
Then, a scientific team led by molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee, then at the University of Utah, found the answer.The team used a battery of the newly developed "gene probes," snippets of genetic material that can track a gene's presence in a cell
The team used a battery of the newly developed "gene probes," snippets of genetic material that can track a gene's presence in a cell.By analyzing cells extracted from eye tumors, they found defects in the second copy of chromosome 13 in the exact area as in the first copy of the chromosome
The finding riveted medicine.It was the first time anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer
It was the first time anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer. "It was extraordinarily satisfying
It was extraordinarily satisfying.I was convinced that what was true of retinoblastoma would be true for all cancers
But in Baltimore, Dr. Vogelstein, a young molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School, believed Dr. Knudson was right, and set out to repeat the Cavenee experiment in cells from other cancers.His was one of two research teams in 1984 to report dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called Wilm's tumor
Dr. Vogelstein next turned his attention to colon cancer, the second biggest cancer killer in the U.S. after lung cancer.He believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple "hits" on cancer suppressor genes, because it often seems to develop in stages
He believed colon cancer might also arise from multiple "hits" on cancer suppressor genes, because it often seems to develop in stages.It often is preceded by the development of polyps in the bowel, which in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages
Dr. Vogelstein and a doctoral student, Eric Fearon, began months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes searching for signs of genetic damage.They began uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions, some existing only in benign polyps, others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells
They began uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions, some existing only in benign polyps, others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells.Gradually, a coherent picture of cancer development emerged
Gradually, a coherent picture of cancer development emerged.If both copies of a certain gene were knocked out, benign polyps would develop
If both copies of a certain gene were knocked out, benign polyps would develop.If both copies of a second gene were then deleted, the polyps would progress to malignancy
If both copies of a second gene were then deleted, the polyps would progress to malignancy.It was clear that more than one gene had to be damaged for colon cancer to develop
Their report galvanized other molecular biologists. "It was the confirming evidence we all needed that {gene} losses were critical to the development of a common tumor
But Dr. Vogelstein had yet to nail the identity of the gene that, if damaged, flipped a colon cell into full-blown malignancy.They focused on chromosome 17
They focused on chromosome 17.For months the Johns Hopkins researchers, using gene probes, experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17, looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells
For months the Johns Hopkins researchers, using gene probes, experimentally crawled down the length of chromosome 17, looking for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost in all tumor cells.Such a piece of DNA would probably constitute a gene
When they found it last winter, Dr. Vogelstein was dubious that the search was over.His doubts stemmed from the fact that several years earlier a Princeton University researcher, Arnold Levine, had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones.The deletion Dr. Vogelstein found was in exactly the same spot as p53
that several years earlier a Princeton University researcher, Arnold Levine, had found in experiments with mice that a gene called p53 could transform normal cells into cancerous ones.The deletion Dr. Vogelstein found was in exactly the same spot as p53
Evidence now is emerging that the p53 suppressor gene is involved in other cancers, too.Researchers in Edinburgh, Scotland, have found that in 23 of 38 breast tumors, one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies
Researchers in Edinburgh, Scotland, have found that in 23 of 38 breast tumors, one copy of chromosome 17 was mutated at the spot where gene p53 lies.that since breast cancer often strikes multiple members of certain families, the gene, when inherited in a damaged form, may predispose women to the cancer
The p53 gene has just been implicated in lung cancer.that about half the cells taken from lung cancer tissue they tested are missing this gene
At the same time, the Johns Hopkins team and others are rushing to pinpoint other tumor-suppressor genes.Dr. Vogelstein hopes soon to isolate one on chromosome 18, also involved in colon cancer
Dr. Vogelstein hopes soon to isolate one on chromosome 18, also involved in colon cancer.Ray White in Utah and Walter Bodmer, a researcher in Great Britain, are close to finding another gene involved with some types of colon cancer, thought to be on chromosome 5
Where these discoveries will lead, scientists can only speculate.Already two major pharmaceutical companies, the Squibb unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., are collaborating with gene hunters to turn the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and, maybe, new therapies
new cancer drugs to slow or reverse tumor growth may be based on the suppressor proteins normally produced by the genes.The idea would be to administer to patients the growth-controlling proteins made by healthy versions of the damaged genes
The idea would be to administer to patients the growth-controlling proteins made by healthy versions of the damaged genes.It may even be possible to replace defective genes with healthy versions, though no one has come close to doing that so far

Known as Easy Eggs, the product has disappointed investors.When the company this month announced lower-than-forecast sales of Easy Eggs, the stock dropped nearly 19%

that by year end it won't be using any shell eggs.The Miami fast-food chain, owned by Grand Metropolitan of Britain, expects to consume roughly 34 million pounds of liquefied eggs annually
So there is reason to believe that Michael's hopes for a bacteria-free, long-shelf-life egg weren't all hype. (Easy Eggs are pasteurized in a heat-using process
Still, caution is advisable.Michael's break-even volume on Easy Eggs is around 60 million pounds a year -- apparently well above current shipments and a far cry from what the company once suggested was a billion-pound market waiting for such a product

I've read Balzac.It's tabloid news from A to Z
Quebecor also publishes a second tabloid in Montreal, the struggling 18-month-old Montreal Daily News; dailies in Quebec City and Winnipeg, Manitoba; and dozens of weeklies covering most of Quebec.A series of recent acquisitions made it the dominant magazine publisher in Quebec
In yesterday's accord, Quebecor agreed to pay $400 million in cash for Maxwell Graphics, and to give Maxwell Communication a 20% stake, valued at $100 million, in Quebecor's new printing subsidiary.The new, as yet unnamed, subsidiary will combine Quebecor's existing printing unit and Maxwell Graphics
The new, as yet unnamed, subsidiary will combine Quebecor's existing printing unit and Maxwell Graphics.It will have 61 plants from coast to coast and $1.5 billion in annual sales
Quebecor will own 57.5% of the new subsidiary.Caisse de Depot et Placement, the Quebec government pension-fund agency, will pay $112.5 million for the remaining 22.5% stake in the printing operation
The Maxwell deal is Quebecor's second big printing acquisition in just over a year.Last October, Quebecor bought 23 Canadian printing plants from BCE Inc., a Montreal telecommunications, manufacturing, energy and real estate company
Last October, Quebecor bought 23 Canadian printing plants from BCE Inc., a Montreal telecommunications, manufacturing, energy and real estate company.That purchase doubled Quebecor's annual printing revenue to $750 million
Maxwell's sale of its U.S. printing unit was expected, the last major business to be disposed of in a major reshuffling of assets.According to its most recent annual report, covering the 15 months ended March 31, Maxwell Communication bought $3.85 billion in assets -- including Macmillan Inc. and Official Airlines Guides -- and sold $2 billion in non-strategic businesses
According to its most recent annual report, covering the 15 months ended March 31, Maxwell Communication bought $3.85 billion in assets -- including Macmillan Inc. and Official Airlines Guides -- and sold $2 billion in non-strategic businesses.Now, Maxwell founder Robert Maxwell says he has an appetite for new acquisitions in the U.S., adding that he could spend "a good deal more" than $1 billion on another U.S. purchase

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission sued New York state for age discrimination against appointed state judges.The suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, charges that New York's mandatory retirement age of 76 violates federal law
Separately, the commission intervened in a Connecticut state judge's age-bias suit in federal court in New Haven.The commission's filing in that case challenges Connecticut's mandatory retirement age of 70 for appointed judges
The New York suit was filed on behalf of Justice Isaac Rubin, whose appointment to the state appellate division expires at year end, and all other judges hurt by the alleged age discrimination.The suit, assigned to federal Judge Kimba Wood, seeks a permanent injunction, back pay for judges who have been forced to retire, reinstatement of retired judges and "other affirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effects of (New York's) unlawful employment practices
The issue isn't age -- age is just a number.The issue is one of a judge's experience, his competence and his physical ability to serve on the bench
The issue is one of a judge's experience, his competence and his physical ability to serve on the bench," Justice Rubin said. "I've had no problems performing my duties and responsibilities
I've had no problems performing my duties and responsibilities." Because Justice Rubin turned 76 on May 9, he isn't eligible to be reappointed to the bench at the end of the year
The suit's impact on New York may be narrow, however.Most New York judges are elected, and the federal age-discrimination law doesn't apply to elected officials
Most New York judges are elected, and the federal age-discrimination law doesn't apply to elected officials.Under New York law, elected judges must retire at age 70, but then can be appointed to two-year terms until they reach 76
In Connecticut, however, most state judges are appointed by the governor and approved by the state legislature.The parties in the Connecticut case have agreed to stay proceedings pending the appeal of another EEOC age-bias case against Vermont

In the Vermont case, a federal judge ruled that the state's mandatory age of 70 for appointed judges was illegal; Vermont's appeal of that decision is pending before the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan
Aaron Ment, Connecticut's chief court administrator, declined to comment on the suit and the EEOC's intervention.He said the state has 165 appointed judges and 15 "trial referees," who are former judges over age 70 and serve a restricted role on the bench
The units are autonomous from U.S. attorneys' offices and focus exclusively on prosecuting organized-crime cases.In February, Mr. Thornburgh announced his plan to abolish the units
to abolish the units.He says the strike-force lawyers will work more efficiently under the supervision of U.S. attorneys
Mr. Thornburgh will be free to disband the strike forces after Congress approves a $479 million appropriation for federal law-enforcement and drug-interdiction agencies, according to David Runkel, a Justice Department spokesman.The bill is expected to pass in Congress next month
Mr. Thornburgh's plan will needlessly break up longtime, tightly knit crime-fighting units that have successfully prosecuted major organized-crime figures.that organized-crime activity will increase once the units are dissolved and their responsibilities transferred to U.S. attorneys' offices
the units have already begun to break up.The Eastern District unit in Brooklyn, N.Y., lost seven of its 15 attorneys this year partly because the lawyers were troubled by the proposed reorganization
there has been no exodus of strike-force lawyers.He says 27 lawyers have left and 21 have been hired since Mr. Thornburgh announced his plan
He says 27 lawyers have left and 21 have been hired since Mr. Thornburgh announced his plan.At the time the plan was announced, there were 135 lawyers

Although settlement talks had been dropped, attorneys for the two sides apparently began talking again yesterday in an attempt to settle the matter before Thursday, when a judge is expected to rule on Warner's request for an injunction that would block the two producers from taking over the management of Columbia.Yesterday, in documents filed in connection with that case, Warner accused Sony officials of falsely claiming that they never read the five-year contract requiring the two producers to make movies exclusively for Columbia, citing Securities and Exchange Commission filings made by Sony that described the contracts
the Sony executives hadn't seen the contract because "it wasn't relevant once Guber and Peters told them Warner would let them terminate it at any time.statements about the contract made in SEC filings were made by attorneys who did have access to the contracts but who weren't part of the negotiations between Sony and the duo
Warner described as "nonsense" yesterday Sony's assertions in prior court filings that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters could in theory run Columbia while still fulfilling their contract to produce movies for Warner.Such a dual role would be "impractical and unethical

In fact, the earnings report unfolded as representatives of the world's No. 1 jet maker and the striking Machinists union came back to the negotiating table for their first meeting in two weeks.Doug Hammond, the federal mediator in Seattle, where Boeing is based, said the parties will continue to sit down daily until a new settlement proposal emerges or the talks break off again
For the third quarter, net rose to $242 million, or $1.05 a share, from $144 million, or 63 cents a share.Sales climbed 71% to $6.36 billion from $3.72 billion as the company capitalized on the ravenous global demand for commercial airliners
The investment community, however, strongly believes that the strike will be settled before there is any lasting effect on either Boeing or its work force.The company's total firm backlog of unfilled orders at Sept. 30 stood at a mighty $69.1 billion, compared with $53.6 billion at the end of
Boeing had been counting on turning 96 aircraft out the door in the present period.That included 21 of the company's 747-400 jumbo jets, its most successful product
That's the primary reason the company's share price has held up so well when, in Mr. Smith's words, "most companies would have unraveled" by now.In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Boeing closed yesterday at $54.50 a share, off a scant 12.5 cents
Still, Boeing went through its normal verbal gymnastics and played up the downside.In a statement, Chairman Frank Shrontz asserted that the company "faces significant challenges and risks," on both its commercial and government contracts
that spending on Pentagon programs is shrinking, and Boeing is either the prime contractor or a major supplier on many important military projects, including the B-2 Stealth bomber, the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft and the Air Force's next-generation tactical fighter.Because of cost overruns on fixed-price military work the company's defense business will record "a significant loss" in 1989
Moreover production-rate increases that have been implemented on the 737, 747, 757 and 767 programs have resulted in "serious work force skill-dilution problems." Suppliers and subcontractors are experiencing heightened pressure to support delivery schedules
And, of course, there's the unsteady labor situation.Besides the Machinists pact, accords representing 30,000 of the company's engineering and technical employees in the Puget Sound and Wichita, Kan., areas expire in early December
Also, a contract with the United Auto Workers at the company's helicopter plant in Philadelphia expired Oct. 15.This contract, covering about 3,000 hourly production and maintenance workers, is being extended on a day-to-day basis
The Machinists rejected a proposal featuring a 10% base wage increase over the life of the three-year contract, plus bonuses of 8% the first year and 3% the second.On top of that, Boeing would make cost-of-living adjustments projected to be 5% for each year of the contract
The union, though, has called the offer "insulting." The company reiterated yesterday that it's willing to reconfigure the package, but not add to the substance of it
For the nine months, Boeing's net increased 36% to $598 million, or $2.60 a share, from $440 million, or $1.92 a share.Sales soared 28% to $15.43 billion from $12.09 billion
The settlement relates to four contracts negotiated from 1982 to 1985, prosecutors said.They added that the settlement is the culmination of a 2 1/2-year investigation into the company's aluminum pricing practices in connection with KC-135s
All along the company has said there was no grounds for criminal prosecution.That was borne out by the Justice Department's decision" to settle the case
At least two rival applications are expected to emerge in coming months, including one from TransCanada PipeLines Ltd., Canada's largest natural gas pipeline operator.Another is expected from a consortium of oil and gas producers who won conditional approval this month from Canada's National Energy Board to export about 9.2 trillion cubic feet of Mackenzie delta gas to the U.S. starting in 1996
Foothills' main rival to build a Mackenzie Delta pipeline is likely to be TransCanada PipeLines.The Toronto-based company, together with Tenneco Inc. of Houston, has had an incomplete proposal filed with Canadian regulators since 1984 that it is now updating
Like Foothills, TransCanada's Polar Gas consortium plans to build a pipeline directly south from the Mackenzie River delta in Canada's western Arctic with an initial capacity to transport 1.2 billion cubic feet of gas daily.they expect a fierce battle to emerge between TransCanada, which has a monopoly on Canadian gas transportation east of Alberta, and Nova and Westcoast, which control the pipelines within and running west of Alberta, respectively
This is virgin territory, unclaimed, and it's going to be nasty.Neither is going to back down easily
First, the price of natural gas will have to almost double.the company believes the project would be viable if gas prices reach US$3.25 a thousand cubic feet by 1995, in current dollars, up from a current spot price of about US$1.50
it plans to seek regulatory approval to build an alternative line, the Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System further north toward Alaska.If that option is favored by gas buyers and regulators it would build another smaller pipeline connecting Mackenzie Delta reserves to the Alaska mainline
It's also likely that regulators will try to forge some kind of consensus between the would-be pipeline builders before undertaking any hearings into rival projects.that producers would prefer to avoid hearings into competing proposals that would lengthen the regulatory review process and bog down development
The decision reflects the Fed's tougher stance on enforcing the Community Reinvestment Act, a federal law passed in 1977 to help low-income residents obtain loans.In recent years, unions and community groups have won big commitments from banks to make low-interest loans in certain neighborhoods by threatening to hold up proposed acquisitions with protests to the Fed about reinvestment act compliance
During the summer, Legal Services Corp., a Florida legal aid group, filed a petition with the Fed on behalf of residents in four Florida counties.The petition challenged First Union's lending record in the state, saying that the bank-holding company had "shut itself off from contact with the low-income community and is redlining almost every black neighborhood that it serves in the state
First Union, with assets of about $32 billion, said it was disappointed by the delay but said it would cooperate with regulatory authorities.The bank added that it believes the review will "demonstrate that First Union is in compliance with the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act

The company has already missed its initial Oct. 1 target date for completing the merger.it still expects to close the acquisition later this year or early in 1990
Florida National, if acquired, would almost double First Union's banking franchise in Florida to $17 billion in assets.That would make it the second-largest bank, after Barnett Banks Inc., in a state widely considered to be the most lucrative banking market in the country
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, First Union shares rose 25 cents to $23.Florida National stock closed unchanged at $25.875 in national over-the-counter trading
In a meeting in New York yesterday, the committee put on hold instructions it gave two weeks ago to its experts to explore other options for Eastern's future, the sources said.The consultants had been working to finish a report this week
That means Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp. of Houston, can go forward with its pitch for creditor approval as early as today, when it is expected to deliver a revised reorganization plan to the committee.The committee intends to meet next week to make a recommendation on the new plan
Texas Air has run into difficulty reselling about $20 million of debt securities because of problems in the junk bond market And plans to raise another $20 million through changes to an insurance policy have hit a snag.the $40 million will have no effect whatsoever on the asset structure of Eastern's plan
the $40 million will have no effect whatsoever on the asset structure of Eastern's plan.Forty million in the total scheme of things is not that significant
However, since Eastern first filed for Chapter 11 protection March 9, it has consistently promised to pay creditors 100 cents on the dollar.Because the carrier is still pledging to do that, some committee members successfully argued that there's little reason yet to explore a different plan, according to one person familiar with the creditors' position

Yesterday, Joel Zweibel, an attorney for Eastern's creditors committee, declined to comment on whether the experts had ever been instructed to look at other choices and whether they now were asked not to.He said only that the committee has not yet taken any position on Eastern's reorganization plan and that the two sides were still negotiating
and that the two sides were still negotiating. "In every case, people would like to see a consentual plan
Eastern and its creditors agreed in July on a reorganization plan that called for the carrier to sell off $1.8 billion in assets and to emerge from Chapter 11 status in late 1989 at two-thirds its former size.Eastern eventually decided not to sell off a major chunk, its South American routes, which were valued at $400 million

That would be a blow to both Paribas and Navigation Mixte.Each had claimed Allianz, Europe's largest insurance company, as a tacit ally
The Allianz statement also reinforced the belief that the takeover battle could be a long one.It led to broad market speculation that Paribas now will sweeten its bid, which is expected to be formally launched later this week, after approval from French government regulators
Allianz's entry reflects the increasing eagerness of West German companies, looking ahead to the reduction in European Community internal barriers in 1992, to get involved in what until now were considered internal French affairs.Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank all also have expressed eagerness to expand in France before 1992

Allianz currently holds between 5% and 10% of Navigation Mixte, an apparent increase from the 5% stake that Navigation Mixte officials had earlier announced.Allianz was buying yesterday morning, and Navigation Mixte moved up 108 francs ($17.19) to close at 1,908 francs in heavy trading
Paris market sources said they believed Allianz was buying yesterday morning, and Navigation Mixte moved up 108 francs ($17.19) to close at 1,908 francs in heavy trading.It was the first day of trading following the suspension of Navigation Mixte shares last Monday, when Paribas announced its plan to pay 1,850 francs for each Navigation Mixte share

Allianz didn't say whom, if anyone, it will support.It said simply that it will boost its Navigation Mixte stake as it sees fit over the coming days to protect itself, as long as it has French regulatory officials' approval
Paribas currently intends to offer 1,850 francs a share for Navigation Mixte shares that receive full dividends this year.It is to offer 1,800 francs for shares created on July 1, which receive partial dividends
Alternatively, it would offer to swap three Paribas shares for one Navigation Mixte share.Paribas already holds about 18.7% of Navigation Mixte, and the acquisition of the additional 48% would cost it about 11 billion francs under its current bid

The settlement stemmed from a lawsuit the dealers filed in 1982 when the Times began its own competing direct delivery service.The pact calls for the Times to pay dealers $3.6 million over six years, as well as other payments in the form of subsidies over three years, based on the number of "new customers started by the dealers and on pricing structures
The amount of the settlement will be taken as a charge against earnings in the fourth quarter.The settlement, which involves most of the 300 independent newspaper dealers in the New York area, will allow the Times to freely operate its own direct home delivery system
Home delivery is the fastest growing segment of the Times's 1.1 million daily circulation.Currently, about 60% of home delivery subscribers in the New York area receive the paper directly from the Times

that the verdict reaffirms her position and our position that advertisers and advertising agencies cannot with impunity imitate the voices of well-known performers.That is a property right that belongs to the performer
because the same court had dismissed a similar case in 1970 involving singer Nancy Sinatra and a tire ad -- also a Young & Rubicam product.Ms. Sinatra sued over the use of her "These Boots are Made for Walkin'" song in the ad
One thing that is a little unnerving is that you had three old men on the court of appeals in California coming up with a statement that Nancy Sinatra is not distinctive but that Bette Midler is.I am not sure that judges, many of whom I like very much, are proper repositories for making distinctions about pop singers
that the latest decisions are having a chilling effect. "It has made people think twice about how they use music and is forcing them to be more circumspect about doing a particular rendition of a song in its most famous form

Only one thing is certain here: Pysllium is likely to remain solely an export item from Sidhpur for a long time.Local farmers say it is as good a cash crop as mustard or fenugreek, a legume.But they have no desire to eat a bowl of psyllium each morning, and, perhaps, little need

Cincinnati-based P&G took an interest; it ordered two studies on psyllium and cholesterol
One of the studies, done at the University of Minnesota, tested 75 people with raised cholesterol levels.After 16 weeks, the group that took three daily teaspoons of Metamucil saw a significant dip in their general cholesterol levels, and an even larger reduction in levels of low-density lipoproteins, the so-called bad cholesterol

Currently, there is a lull in the psyllium war.The FDA has asked Kellogg and General Mills to show research that their cereals are safe
But the agency hasn't yanked psyllium off store shelves.If the FDA approves the new uses of psyllium, other companies are expected to rush to market with psyllium products

Says psyllium exporter Mr. Patel: "I just got back yesterday from the U.S.In the newspapers, on the radio and TV, psyllium is everywhere
But the news of the boom has yet to trickle down to the farmers.They only know of one use for the crop, as a laxative, and with psyllium prices currently languishing in the wake of a bumper crop, they think of the seed as a marginal crop, something to grow between summer wheat crops
Psyllium's not a good crop.You get a rain at the wrong time and the crop is ruined
Even at the Basic Chemicals, Pharmaceuticals and Cosmetics Export Promotion Council, the government agency that promotes the seed, the psyllium boom is distant thunder.The staff brags about psyllium's hefty contribution to American regularity, without quite grasping the implications of the research on cholesterol

In one way, the psyllium middlemen -- the buyers and exporters -- are glad to keep news of the boom to themselves.They want psyllium prices low for their purchases next year

In Sidhpur, it is almost time to sow this year's crop.Many farmers, too removed to glean psyllium's new sparkle in the West, have decided to plant mustard, fennel, cumin, fenugreek or castor-oil seeds

For employee and employer alike, the worry is widespread.that small-business owners rank the availability and rising cost of health insurance as one of their biggest concerns
I have an old-fashioned name for people in that position: sick people who need health insurance.What we're seeing now makes a mockery of the idea of insurance: collect premiums from the healthy, dump the sick and let them pay their own bills
What we're seeing now makes a mockery of the idea of insurance: collect premiums from the healthy, dump the sick and let them pay their own bills." Some lawmakers may seek legislation to limit overly restrictive insurance policies
to woo the small-business market.As larger companies increasingly self-insure, or use reserves to pay their own workers' medical bills, the insurance industry has turned to the small-employer market that was once a backwater for them
Insurance companies will offer a good rate if no one is sick, but it's a roll of the dice.One case of cancer or a high-risk pregnancy with a sick infant, and rates go up 40% to 60%
One case of cancer or a high-risk pregnancy with a sick infant, and rates go up 40% to 60%.Small-business people end up paying insurance premiums worth two to three times the cost of one illness
Some business analysts blame the problem on tough competition in the insurance market.They say insurance companies use policies aimed at excluding bad risks because their competitors do
I'm not accusing insurers of dereliction of duty.You can't ask one carrier to underwrite on social grounds when that might destroy it in the marketplace
Rep. Waxman and Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts have proposed regulation to deal with the problem.The proposal is just part of legislation that would require businesses to provide health benefits, an idea that is strongly opposed by small business who say it would just compound the insurance-cost problems
But first on the list of priorities, says the National Federation of Independent Business, is to prohibit state laws requiring the inclusion of specialty items, such as psychiatric care, in basic health plans.Such requirements make it difficult to provide a basic, low-cost health-benefits package

China's leaders have promised generous liberties for post-1997 Hong Kong.That promise sounds shaky now that those same leaders have fallen back on Marxist dogma and brute force to crush their nation's democracy movement
Outflows of people and capital from Hong Kong have been growing since the sovereignty issue first arose in the early 1980s.that, given its robust economy, Hong Kong will be able to attract sufficient foreign money and talent to comfortably offset the outflows
A widely held assumption all along has been that, given its robust economy, Hong Kong will be able to attract sufficient foreign money and talent to comfortably offset the outflows.With interest in emigration and investment abroad soaring since June 4, that assumption no longer seems so safe

Investors have to accept the possibility of a significant slowdown in economic activity in the runup to 1997.Over the next few years, I would advise caution
In a soon-to-be published book on the territory, a political economist, Miron Mushkat, has derived three future scenarios from interviews with 41 Hong Kong government officials and businessmen.Nearly half of them argue that Hong Kong's uneasy relationship with China will constrain -- though not inhibit -- long-term economic growth
Nearly half of them argue that Hong Kong's uneasy relationship with China will constrain -- though not inhibit -- long-term economic growth.The rest are split roughly between optimists who expect Hong Kong to hum along as before and pessimists who foresee irreparable chaos

Since the China crisis erupted the scenario as depicted by the middle-of-the-road group bears a remarkable resemblance to the difficulties Hong Kong currently faces.that the local economy will grow through the 1990s at annual rates averaging between 3% and 5%

Going by official forecasts of GDP, which measures the colony's output of goods and services, minus foreign income, Mr. Mushkat's "realists" seem relatively close to the mark.After taking into account the fallout from the China crisis, the government has projected 1989 GDP growth of 5%

Many factors besides a dread of 1997 will have a bearing on Hong Kong's economy.One concerns Japanese investors
One concerns Japanese investors.Barely visible on Hong Kong's property scene in 1985, by last year Japan had become the top foreign investor, spending $602 million
Barely visible on Hong Kong's property scene in 1985, by last year Japan had become the top foreign investor, spending $602 million.The market has grown relatively quiet since the China crisis
Another -- and critical -- factor is the U.S., Hong Kong's biggest export market.Even before the China crisis, weak U.S. demand was slowing local economic growth
that global forces will continue to govern Hong Kong's economic rhythm.Once external conditions, such as U.S. demand, swing in the territory's favor local businessmen will probably overcome their 1997 worries and continue doing business as usual
But economic arguments, however solid, won't necessarily impress Hong Kong's 5.7 million people.Many are refugees, having fled China's unending cycles of political repression and poverty since the Communist Party took power in 1949

Though the trading halts are offered as a sign of concern about recent stock market volatility, most Wall Street firms remain open to handle program trading for customers.Trading executives privately say that huge stock-index funds, which dwarf Wall Street firms in terms of the size of their program trades, will continue to launch big programs through the stock market
Wells Fargo Investment Advisers, Bankers Trust Co. and Mellon Capital Management are among the top stock-index arbitrage clients of Wall Street, trading executives say.These huge stock-index funds build portfolios that match the S&P 500 stock index or other stock indexes, and frequently swap between stocks and futures to capture profits

Stock-index funds have grown in popularity over the past decade as pension funds and other institutional investors have sought a low-cost way to match the performance of the stock market as a whole.Many money managers who trade stock actively have trouble consistently matching the S&P-500's returns
Wells Fargo Investment Advisers, for example, managed $25 billion in stock investments tracking the S&P 500 at the end of June, according to Standard & Poor's Corp. Mr. Grauer said $2 billion of that is used in active index arbitrage
The Wall Street firms' pullback followed their recent blacklisting by several institutional investors.Last Tuesday, Kemper Corp. 's Kemper Financial Services Inc. unit said it would no longer trade with firms committed to stock-index arbitrage, including the three that later suspended stock-index arbitrage trading on Friday

The best of the crop was last week's season premiere of "In the Heat of the Night," the NBC series based on a 1967 feature film about a black Philadelphia police detective in a small Southern town.In the series, Virgil Tibbs (Howard Rollins) and his wife, Althea (Anne-Marie Johnson) have settled in Sparta, Miss
In the series, Virgil Tibbs (Howard Rollins) and his wife, Althea (Anne-Marie Johnson) have settled in Sparta, Miss.Because the show has acquired a sense of place by being filmed on location in Georgia, this episode -- in which Althea gets raped by an arrogant white schoolteacher -- does a decent job of tracing the social repercussions of the crime
But tonight's offering, "Settle the Score" (9-11 p.m. EST, on NBC), doesn't even try.This tale of a Chicago policewoman returning home to find the man who raped her 20 years earlier is supposed to be set in the Ozarks.But it's more like an illustration of what Ben Stein describes in his study of social attitudes in the TV industry: "Fear of violence and animosity . . . because of race or religion, fear and lack of comprehension about the politics of small-town people . . . produce a powerful wave of dislike of small towns in the minds of TV writers and producers
The writer and executive producer of "Settle the Score," Steve Sohmer, is a graduate of Yale who participated in a PBS documentary, aired this summer, in which six members of the Yale class of 1963 ruminated about their lives since graduation.At one point in the documentary, Mr. Sohmer, who is Jewish, says he felt rejected by many of the Protestants and Southerners he met at Yale
he felt rejected by many of the Protestants and Southerners he met at Yale.He quotes one student saying, "You're just the kind of Jewboy we Southerners can't stand
He quotes one student saying, "You're just the kind of Jewboy we Southerners can't stand.that it was partly in response to such attitudes that he is now "a dweller on one of the two islands off the coast of America
Not to judge by "Settle the Score," in which Mr. Sohmer seems to be settling a score of his own.Of all the unflattering portraits of small-town America I've seen on TV, this film is the most gratuitously nasty
Of all the unflattering portraits of small-town America I've seen on TV, this film is the most gratuitously nasty.The sole sympathetic character is the prodigal daughter Kate (Jaclyn Smith), and she is tolerable only by virtue of having nothing in common with her kinfolk, a truly benighted pack of Southern Protestants whose grim existence consists mostly of growing peaches and repressing sex
I mean, these folks are so uptight that they blame pretty Kate for the fact that when she was a teen-ager, someone tied her hands behind her back, thrust her head into a gunny sack, brutally raped and beat her, and then left her to die in a cold-storage room.Her Pa (Howard Duff) is the kind of guy who, while saying grace at the supper table, pauses at the word "sin" and glares at the daughter he hasn't seen for two decades, because he knows in his heart that she enjoyed what happened in the cold-storage room, and has been indulging the same taste ever since in the fleshpots of Chicago
But in Mr. Sohmer's Ozarks, he is but the tip of the patriarchal iceberg.Every man Kate encounters is either sniggeringly puritanical, viciously patronizing, revoltingly lecherous, or all three
Every man Kate encounters is either sniggeringly puritanical, viciously patronizing, revoltingly lecherous, or all three.Add the fact that any one of them, including Pa, could be her attacker, and you have a setting that doesn't resemble small-town America, or even Hollywood's nightmare of small-town America, so much as a paranoid feminist dystopia like Margaret Atwood's "The Handmaid's Tale," itself soon to be (you guessed it) a Hollywood movie
There are two exceptions: Josh (Jeffrey DeMunn), the local doctor who has always loved Kate; and Lincoln (Richard Masur), Kate's simple-minded but affectionate brother.Josh makes clumsy passes at Kate when she's seething with anger and fear, but we know from the outset that he's not a member of the evil patriarchy
but we know from the outset that he's not a member of the evil patriarchy.How could he be
How could he be?He's the director of the local Planned Parenthood chapter
Josh makes clumsy passes at Kate when she's seething with anger and fear, but we know from the outset that he's not a member of the evil patriarchy.How could he be?He's the director of the local Planned Parenthood chapter.As for Lincoln, if you can't guess why he's so sweet to his sister when everybody else hates her, then I'm not going to tell you
As for the women, they're pathetic.Kate's Ma (Louise Latham) is a moral coward
Kate's Ma (Louise Latham) is a moral coward.Her sister-in-law (Amy Wright) is a sniveling prude afraid that Kate will seduce all the married men in town, including a particularly loathsome fellow named Tucker
Her sister-in-law (Amy Wright) is a sniveling prude afraid that Kate will seduce all the married men in town, including a particularly loathsome fellow named Tucker, whose idea of fun is to leave his wife at home tending to her bruises and cigarette burns, while he bullies Kate into a dance that consists of drooling on her while trying to break her ribs.At the very least, it would appear that Sis is a poor judge of masculine charm
Yet even these insulting caricatures are not as bad as the moral hypocrisy at the heart of "Settle the Score." In the aforementioned episode of "In the Heat of the Night," we saw Althea being attacked, but we weren't invited to enjoy the spectacle
At this point, the truce between feminism and sensationalism gets mighty uneasy.Take the scene in which Kate stands naked by a lighted window, whispering to her hidden assailant, "Look all you want.Starting tomorrow, I'm stalking you
Surely the question is obvious.With friends like Mr. Sohmer, do the feminists of Hollywood need enemies?

Additionally, Crossland reported a third-quarter loss of $175.5 million, or $13.44 a share, compared with net income of $27.1 million, or $1.16 a share, a year ago.A major factor in the third-quarter loss was the write-down of $143.6 million of goodwill

If it promotes fashion too much, the shop risks alienating its old-line customers; by emphasizing "value," it risks watering down its high-minded mystique
Fashion industry consultants also question whether the company can make significant strides in its women's business, given that its customer base is less established and that conservative business dress for women is on the decline.Brooks Brothers' aim is for 20% of total sales to come from the women's department, up from the current 12%

Dow Jones has said it believes the $18-a-share price is fair to Telerate's minority shareholders.Late last week, representatives of Dow Jones and Telerate began negotiations about the terms of the offer, but those talks didn't result in any changes in the offer
Telerate provides information about financial markets through an electronic network.Dow Jones, which owns 67% of Telerate, publishes The Wall Street Journal, Barron's magazine, community newspapers and operates financial news services and computer data bases

Upset over the use of what it says are its exclusive trademarks, Hells Angels Motorcycle Corp. is fighting back -- in court.Concord New Horizons Corp., creators of a 1988 movie called Nam Angels, used the gang's name and trademarks without authorization
In addition to being broadcast on cable television, the movie also is being distributed on videocassettes, the suit alleges in seeking unspecified damages.Also named in the suit is Media Home Entertainment Inc. of Culver City, Calif., its parent, Heron Communications Inc., and Broadstar Television of Los Angeles, holders of the copyright on the movie
There is absolutely no way our board or membership would have approved the portrayal of the Hells Angels in this movie.Portrayal of our members as disloyal to each other is totally contrary to the most important values of our organization -- loyalty and trust
Nam Angels shows Angels fighting with each other and also depicts them as showing no remorse when a member is killed.Both of these actions aren't characteristic of real Hells Angels
Hells Angels was formed in 1948 and incorporated in 1966.In addition to 26 chapters in the U.S., there are 40 chapters in foreign countries

The world had a big yuk recently when the Soviets reported a rash of UFO landings, one of them bringing tall aliens who glowed in the dark to Voronezh.It is the opinion of Timothy Good, author of "Above Top Secret: The World UFO Cover-Up" (Quill/William Morrow, 592 pages, $12.95), that the world laughs too fast

Towering overcapacity in the synthetic fiber business, which accounted for half of the Dutch chemical company's sales, led to huge losses and left Akzo's survival in doubt.It wasn't until the early 1980s that Akzo nursed itself back to health
it is in far better shape to cope.Investment analysts generally agree
Aside from slashing costs and investing heavily in its plants, Akzo has spent 3.9 billion guilders ($1.88 billion) on acquisitions since 1983 to give it better balance.During the same period, the company has sold about 1.6 billion guilders of assets
The fibers business now accounts for only 20% of Akzo's sales. "We have definitely become less cyclical
Still, Akzo hasn't yet found a way to achieve another goal: a large presence in the U.S. market for prescription drugs.prices for U.S. pharmaceutical companies remain too high, making it unlikely that Akzo will pursue any major acquisitions in that area
An indication of Akzo's success in reshaping itself will come Thursday when it reports third-quarter results.Analysts expect the company to show profit of about 225 million guilders, up 9% from 206.3 million guilders a year earlier
Maybe Akzo can surprise the investment world a bit.Akzo is likely to be one of the few major chemical companies to show profit growth next year
Akzo is likely to be one of the few major chemical companies to show profit growth next year.Akzo will show per-share earnings of 24 guilders in 1990, up from an estimated 22.5 guilders for this year and the 20.9 guilders reported for 1988

We're sorry to see Nigel Lawson's departure from the British government.He is a politician with the courage of true conviction, as in summarily sacking exchange controls and in particular slashing the top rate of income taxation to 40%
The early omens scarcely suggest so wholesome an outcome.The Fleet Street reaction was captured in the Guardian headline, "Departure Reveals Thatcher Poison
British politicians divide into two groups of chickens, those with their necks cut and those screaming the sky is falling.So far as we can see only two persons are behaving with a dignity recognizing the seriousness of the issues: Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan Walters, the counterpoint of the Chancellor's difficulties, who also resigned as personal adviser to Mrs. Thatcher
The problem is that on the vital issue of monetary policy and exchange rates, conservative, free-market economists divide into at least three incompatible camps.There are the strict monetarists, who believe that floating exchange rates free an economy to stabilize its price level by stabilizing the monetary aggregates
There are the strict monetarists, who believe that floating exchange rates free an economy to stabilize its price level by stabilizing the monetary aggregates.There are the supply-side globalists, who seek to spread the advantages of a common currency through fixed exchange rates
In the British case, Mr. Lawson is the closest thing in London to a supply-side globalist.He not only slashed marginal tax rates, initially sparking fresh growth in Britain, but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates, indeed joining the European Monetary System
He not only slashed marginal tax rates, initially sparking fresh growth in Britain, but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates, indeed joining the European Monetary System.While no doubt agreeing with Mr. Lawson on everything else, Sir Alan is a dyed-in-the-wool monetarist, inclined to defend floating rates to the death
that Mr. Lawson's tax cuts would have profound effects on Britain's international accounts and the value of sterling.They increased the after-tax rate of return and made Britain a far more attractive place to invest, producing sudden capital inflows
They increased the after-tax rate of return and made Britain a far more attractive place to invest, producing sudden capital inflows.By accounting definitions, this had to produce a sudden trade deficit
At this point, the options were: Crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates, as Sir Alan surely advised, and forget the soaring pound.To push the pound even lower trying to cure the trade deficit, a policy Britain has repeatedly proved disastrous
But this devastated the U.S. manufacturing sector, laying the seeds of protectionism.Mr. Lawson, though not allowed to join the EMS, chose to "shadow" the deutsche mark
Mr. Lawson, though not allowed to join the EMS, chose to "shadow" the deutsche mark.He reaped inflation along with rapid growth, no doubt validating Sir Alan's predictions in the Prime Minister's mind
So the British experience presents a genuine puzzle that reaches far beyond the shores of Albion.We had been soliciting opinions on it long before Mr. Lawson's resignation, and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his successor and one-time deputy, John Major
We had been soliciting opinions on it long before Mr. Lawson's resignation, and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his successor and one-time deputy, John Major.To begin with, we should note that in contrast to the U.S. deficit, Britain has been running largish budget surpluses
To begin with, we should note that in contrast to the U.S. deficit, Britain has been running largish budget surpluses.In pursuit of this mystery, Keynesian adepts and twin-deficit mavens need not apply
We should also add Mr. Lawson's own explanation, as we understand it.Unlike the U.S., Britain never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages
Unlike the U.S., Britain never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages.The wage stickiness, which OECD studies confirm is particularly high in Britain, gives its economy a structural bias toward inflation
Unlike the U.S., Britain never achieved even a momentary reduction in real wages.The wage stickiness, which OECD studies confirm is particularly high in Britain, gives its economy a structural bias toward inflation.Inflation is easier to spark and harder to control
Perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates, though of course in the event Mr. Lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound, not restrain a strong one.We recall that Mr. Roberts not only chides the Chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling, but also led the chorus saying that Mr. Volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise
that Mr. Roberts not only chides the Chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to constrain sterling, but also led the chorus saying that Mr. Volcker was too tight when he let the dollar rise.Somewhere in between there must be a golden mean, perhaps measured by M-Whatever, but perhaps measured by purchasing power parity
In fixing rates the choice of initial parities is crucial, for example, and perhaps he picked the wrong pound-DM rate.For that matter, perhaps he fixed to the wrong currency
For that matter, perhaps he fixed to the wrong currency.We sympathize with Mrs. Thatcher's reluctance to tie her currency to one governed by the domestic political imperatives of West Germany
We sympathize with Mrs. Thatcher's reluctance to tie her currency to one governed by the domestic political imperatives of West Germany.Perhaps the shock would have been less if they'd fixed to another low-tax, deregulated, supply-side economy
that the unrecognized inflationary culprit is the budget surplus.that the retirement of gilts for cash is equivalent to an expansionary open-market operation
In particular, "shadowing" a currency is anything but fixing; it is an open announcement that the exchange rate target has no credibility
it is an open announcement that the exchange rate target has no credibility.All the more so when strong voices are heard opposing the policy
All the more so when strong voices are heard opposing the policy.Better to have a true monetarist policy, just for the experience
What Mr. Major and Mrs. Thatcher will do now remains to be seen.They confront stubborn inflation and a sagging economy, that is to say, stagflation
They confront stubborn inflation and a sagging economy, that is to say, stagflation.This cannot be solved by provoking a further downturn
This cannot be solved by provoking a further downturn; reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation
This cannot be solved by provoking a further downturn; reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation.Our advice is this: Immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through incentive-maximizing tax cuts, and find some monetary policy target that balances both supply and demand for money
Immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through incentive-maximizing tax cuts, and find some monetary policy target that balances both supply and demand for money.This was the version of supply-side economics that, in the late 1970s and early '80s, worked in America and world-wide to solve a far more serious stagflation than afflicts Britain today
Mr. Phillips made his comments during an interview detailing his plans for the agency.British-born, the 24-year Ogilvy veteran was named last week to succeed Kenneth Roman, who is leaving by year's end to take a top post at American Express, an Ogilvy client
British-born, the 24-year Ogilvy veteran was named last week to succeed Kenneth Roman, who is leaving by year's end to take a top post at American Express, an Ogilvy client.Surrounded by stacks of paper, two computers and photos of himself boating and flying, Mr. Phillips laid out several changes he hopes to make at the agency
he hopes to improve client service.Ogilvy under the fastidious Mr. Roman gained a reputation as occasionally being high-handed in its treatment of clients, of preaching what strategy a client should -- indeed, must -- follow
He also plans to get to know clients that Mr. Roman was closer to, such as Lever Brothers, American Express and Seagram.The two men are planning joint visits to a number of clients to attempt to smoothly hand over the reins
The two men are planning joint visits to a number of clients to attempt to smoothly hand over the reins. "Clients want to see more of our senior people involved in the business -- not once a month, but two or three times a week
Mr. Phillips also hopes to finally implement a reorganization announced earlier this year but put on hold by the WPP takeover.The reorganization is supposed to make one-stop shopping -- buying advertising, public relations and design all in one place, or "Ogilvy Orchestration" in Ogilvyspeak -- a reality
Under the reorganization, Ogilvy plans to name one executive on each account as a "client service director" to work as the client's single contact for all those services. "There is little or no integration of our work, quality is spotty, there is no single focus
There is little or no integration of our work, quality is spotty, there is no single focus," Mr. Phillips complained to staffers in March, when the reorganization was announced.Now Mr. Phillips says he hopes to have the new system in place for several clients -- including American Express, American Telephone & Telegraph and Ryder -- by year's end
Industry executives and analysts are divided on whether Mr. Phillips is up to the task.He isn't as well-known to clients as is Mr. Roman
He isn't as well-known to clients as is Mr. Roman.Under his watch, office politicking was often rampant in the agency's New York operation and the office there has had a dismal new-business record for more than a year
The one thing Mr. Phillips clearly does have going for him is continuity, although it isn't certain if that will be enough.The last thing they need is enormous disruption at the top . . . and Graham is obviously a long-term member of the Ogilvy Mafia, as we call it
Mr. Phillips and Mr. Roman are indeed quite similar in substance, if not in style.While Mr. Roman is a workaholic detailsman, Mr. Phillips would rather delegate, leaving him time for his interests outside the office
that the company's profitability was dragged down this year by an expensive move to luxurious, oversized new New York headquarters.The move, budgeted at about $7 million, actually came in at about $10 million
But margins will be helped, too, by some other cost-saving steps.Ogilvy eliminated the mail room staff, closed the executive dining room and, after the takeover, let go half a dozen financial executives
let go half a dozen financial executives.WPP instituted a new financial system and plans to sublet some floors in Ogilvy's new headquarters building to outsiders
Mr. Klein decided to remove himself to minimize "negative reaction" from prospective clients and others and to prepare for his defense. "The fact that he is in the process of defending himself against the present charges could conceivably have an adverse impact on Y&R

The net loss for the quarter was $43.1 million against a year-earlier loss of $106 million.The loss in the fourth quarter of 1988 reflected in part expenses for an unsuccessful bid for Federated Department Stores Inc., as well as the restructuring of some of its department store operations

The sale, which had been expected, is part of KKR's program to pay down $5 billion of a $6 billion bridge loan by February.Roughly $2 billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales, and RJR expects to use another $2 billion from the pending, two-part sale of most of its Del Monte unit
Louis Gerstner Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of New York-based RJR, called the sale a "significant step" in the company's divestiture program, as well as a "a strategic divestiture." Since KKR bought RJR in February for $25 billion of debt, it has agreed to sell nearly $5 billion of RJR assets

But last June's annnouncement that Westinghouse would put up all of the $70 million to build a new 55-megawatt plant could herald a new age.Westinghouse's plant will provide electrical power to the Southern California Edison Co. and backup power and steam to the U.S. Borax & Chemical Co
its venture with Mitsubishi will help fend off growing competition, particularly in the U.S., from such European competitors as Asea Brown Boveri AG, Siemens AG, and British General Electric Co.Under the agreement, Westinghouse will be able to purchase smaller combustion turbines from its Japanese partner, and package and sell them with its own generators and other equipment
The Westinghouse-Mitsubishi venture was designed as a non-equity transaction, circumventing any possible antitrust concerns.Westinghouse carefully crafted the agreement
that the current surge in demand for new power will be filled primarily by independent producers which, unlike utilities, aren't regulated and therefore don't need government approval to construct new plants.Westinghouse expects about half of its new orders for turbines to come from independent producers for at least the next six years
Even if that scenario occurs, Westinghouse figures it is prepared.The company already is gearing up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it hasn't received an order for a domestic nuclear plant in a decade

By Richterian standards, the show that the Oakland Athletics put on Friday and Saturday nights, in putting a mercifully swift end to the game's Longest Short Series, rated somewhere between a 10 and an 11.but they certainly did some impressive things with baseballs
13-7 and 9-6 wins over the San Francisco Giants.Combined with their two pre-quake victories, way back on Oct. 14 and 15 (the scores were 5-0 and 5-1, remember?), that gave them a sweep of the best-of-seven series
The joke here is that the Giants lost by de fault.That's geologically correct, but a trifle unfair otherwise
but a trifle unfair otherwise.They showed up, but didn't -- or couldn't -- challenge
and managed to stir their fans only once.That came in the seventh inning of Game Four when, trailing 8-2, they scored four times and brought their big heat -- Will Clark and Kevin Mitchell -- to the plate with one out and a runner on

The sole A not to homer was cleanup hitter Mark McGwire, their regular-season leader with 33, and he contributed five hits plus a diving fielding play on a ground ball in Game Three that stopped a Giant rally while the issue still was in doubt. "Think I'll redo my image -- get this changed to a glove
Even with that power show, though, the Oakland Series' star, certified by the Most Valuable Player award, was a pitcher, Dave Stewart.He shut out the Giants on five hits in Game One, and allowed three runs on five hits in seven innings Friday after the 12-day break caused by the earthquake
Stewart's honor was a nice note on a couple of grounds.One was that, despite his 62 regular-season wins over the past three seasons in the Land Beyond the Late News, he has been overshadowed by his more-muscular mates and missed out on prizes that might have been his due

But in the real world, you learn that speed and quality are not a trade-off.Speed is a component of quality -- one of the things we must deliver to satisfy customers
Companies that actually market speed as part of their service train their managers to lead and participate in teams that increase speed and improve quality in everyday operations.Managers learn to spot opportunities to increase customer satisfaction through speed, and shift some responsibility for analyzing, improving and streamlining work processes from themselves to teams of employees
One team at the Federal Express Ground Operations station in Natick, Mass., focused on a particularly time-sensitive operation: the morning package sort.Every morning, tractor-trailer trucks arrive at the Natick Ground Station from Boston's Logan Airport, carrying the day's package load.In peak periods that load may include 4,000 pieces.The packages must be sorted quickly and distributed to smaller vans for delivery, so couriers can be on the road by 8:35

Switzerland's most famous raider says he isn't one.Werner K. Rey believes fortunes are made by being friendly
And in little more than a decade of being friendly the 46-year-old Mr. Rey has grown from a modest banker to a billionaire.He achieved this in part with an uncanny talent for getting his foot peacefully in the door of established European companies
After the transaction, Mr. Rey estimates the value of his 20% stake in the new company, to be held by his Omni Holding AG, will be about 1 billion Swiss francs.This will be his return on an original investment of between 50 million Swiss francs and 80 million Swiss francs

In 1979, his career as an industrialist began with the acquisition of the Swiss metals works Selve, based in Thun.With the nonferrous metals business undermined in Switzerland by tough foreign competition and high domestic costs, this looked like a dull undertaking
But Mr. Rey brought about a merger in the next few years between the country's major producers; the increased efficiency has perked up the industry
Three years later, machinery producer Ateliers de Constructions Mecaniques de Vevey S.A. was to become part of the Rey empire.Once again the company's future looked less than rosy
A major boost to Mr. Rey's respectability among the Swiss came in 1986 when he sold 60% of his Phibro Bank to the conservative Swiss cantonal banks.They renamed it Swiss Cantobank and are using it to expand abroad
They renamed it Swiss Cantobank and are using it to expand abroad.In 1987, Mr. Rey bested leading publishing houses to take over Switzerland's Jean Frey AG, a major producer of magazines and newspapers
And with the recent acquisition of 30% of Winterthur-based machinery manufacturer Gebrueder Sulzer AG, Mr. Rey has enjoyed the status of white knight.Sulzer preferred him to financier Tito Tettamanti, whose secretive raid on the company's stock had led to a bitter battle
Today, this branch of Mr. Rey's empire runs under the name Omnicorp Offering Services and handles mergers and acquisitions, placement of securities and real estate.In its portfolio are such diverse companies as United Kingdom-based Air Europe; Checkrobot Inc., a U.S. company that makes supermarket checkout machines; Norment Industries, a U.S. manufacturer of securities systems; Com Systems Inc., a U.S. regional telephone company; and major real-estate projects in the U.S. and Europe

The U.S. had been under pressure from several Cocom members, especially France, West Germany and Italy, to ease restrictions on some types of machine tools, which those countries argued were now widely available to East Bloc countries from non-Cocom members.For several years some European countries have complained that outdated Cocom lists and restrictions served more to hamper their trade than to add to Western security

If a TV weatherman gets butterflies facing the camera again after a questionable forecast, Donald H. Straszheim surely understands.The chief economist of Merrill Lynch & Co. finds himself in such a position as he buzzes the Midwest on his first road trip since backpedaling on a major prediction
and he's right.Since the last time he traveled this way several months ago, he has recanted a series of bold forecasts of a recession
in a splashy ad campaign launched in the summer of 1988, Merrill Lynch urged investors to buy bonds.It said long-term interest rates, then above 9%, could drop to 7% by the end of 1989, so bonds, which benefit from falling rates, would be a good buy
But this September he took a detour if not a U-turn.He softened the talk about a recession
And, just recently, Merrill Lynch cut the recommended bondholdings back to 50%.While such changes might sound minor, they aren't: Merrill Lynch manages or oversees some $300 billion in retail accounts that include everything from mutual funds to individual annuities
Two well-known colleagues who believe Mr. Straszheim was right the first time are David Bostian Jr. and A. Gary Shilling, both of whom run their own New York research firms.Mr. Bostian said in August that his macroeconomic index signaled recession

trying to pin down the economist.He doesn't fully succeed
In a chilly conference room at Alliance Capital Management in Minneapolis, in contrast, the firm's money managers seem ready to pin Mr. Straszheim to the wall.Alfred Harrison, the manager, shoves Mr. Straszheim's handout back at him
Swiveling in his chair, Mr. Straszheim replies that the new outlook, though still weak, doesn't justify calling a recession right now. "It's all in this handout you don't want to look at
It's all in this handout you don't want to look at.We could still have a recession" at some point
that the new outlook, though still weak, doesn't justify calling a recession right now. "It's all in this handout you don't want to look at.We could still have a recession" at some point.One of Mr. Straszheim's recurring themes is that the state of the economy isn't a simple black or white

The opposition Labor Party leader, Neil Kinnock, in a display of the male chauvinism typical of the British lower class, denounced Mrs. Thatcher for having an independent mind and refusing to heed the men in her Cabinet.The British press, making a mountain out of a molehill, precipitated an unnecessary economic crisis by portraying Mrs. Thatcher as an autocrat who had thrown economic policy into confusion by driving a respected figure from her government
Behind the silly posturing lies a real dispute.Mr. Lawson and his European-minded colleagues want the British pound formally tied to the West German mark.Sir Alan considers this an ill-advised and costly policy
Mr. Lawson and his European-minded colleagues want the British pound formally tied to the West German mark.Sir Alan considers this an ill-advised and costly policy
Until his resignation, Mr. Lawson had been conducting British monetary policy as if the pound were tied to the mark.When Mrs. Thatcher cut the top tax rate to 40%, Mr. Lawson flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark
With inflation surging, the pound began falling against the mark.To keep the exchange rate pegged, Mr. Lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15%
To keep the exchange rate pegged, Mr. Lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to 15%.This doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that Mrs. Thatcher's policies had created, producing widespread disaffection and pushing Labor ahead in the polls
Instead of realizing his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both British economic policy and Mrs. Thatcher's political fortune, Mr. Lawson pushed for tying the pound formally to the mark by entering the European Monetary System.This put Mrs. Thatcher in a bind
This put Mrs. Thatcher in a bind.The concept of European integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals, the media and the imagination, but are full of practical pitfalls
If the pound had been tied to the mark, the British would have been unable to cut their exorbitant tax rates.The reason is simple.When a country cuts tax rates, it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency
The reason is simple.When a country cuts tax rates, it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency
It was fear of disturbing EMS exchange-rate relationships that caused the Chirac government in France to be timid about cutting tax rates.Edouard Balladur, the finance minister at the time, was sold on the tax-cut policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as anti-European for disturbing the linked European currency relationship
The price of attracting capital -- whether one's own or that of foreigners -- is a trade deficit.To avoid this deficit Mr. Lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise
To avoid this deficit Mr. Lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise.This misguided policy could not prevent a British trade deficit
Consequently, Mr. Lawson saddled Mrs. Thatcher with a record trade deficit, renewed inflation and high interest rates -- three political failures in a row.Little wonder that Mrs. Thatcher's opponents were so anxious to keep Mr. Lawson in office
It is extraordinary that the British Treasury thought it could prevent a trade deficit by inflating the pound.The British balance-of-payments statistics show that after the top tax rate was cut to 40%, the flow abroad of British capital slowed, to 50 billion pounds ($79 billion at the current rate) in 1988 from 93 billion pounds in 1986.This change in the British capital account required an offsetting change in the trade account, a change that could not be prevented by pegging the currency

the immense confusion in thought that has been characteristic of Western financial circles during the 1980s.The most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment, instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates
The most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment, instead emphasizing financial flows in response to high interest rates.This has led them in a fruitless and destructive policy circle
First comes monetary expansion to drive down the currency's value that was pushed up by tax-rate reduction.Then, when the currency falls, interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate.This policy is totally mindless

Well, the arrogant East Coast media have spoken again ("Going for the Green," editorial, Oct. 17).Having resided in the great state of California for the past seven years, I find it hard to ignore our environmental problems when I start my commute to work with eyes tearing and head aching from the polluted air; when I try to enjoy the beaches and come home covered with tar and oil; when I hear of numerous deaths related to irresponsible processing of cheese and use of chemicals in fruit growing
suggesting that their save-the-earth initiatives are "whacky" and referring to so many citizens as "la-la activists." Strange that we don't hear similar criticisms of the East Coast activists who seek to clean up Boston Harbor or rid their beaches of medical waste
While there are no easy low-cost solutions, simply ignoring our problems will result in their severity increasing and spreading throughout the state, the nation and the world.If nothing else, such initiatives as these will provide an awareness to citizens and lawmakers and encourage appropriate corrective action
but picking Frank Lloyd Wright to say it for you was a bad call.Wright's organic architecture demonstrated a keen sensitivity to the environment decades before it became fashionable among "la-la activists
Indeed, Wright said all his life that the greatest lessons he learned were derived from the study of nature.Obviously, it's lost on you that about 75% of the American people these days (and in fact the president of the United States) consider themselves environmentalists
As for California being a state run by liberal environmental loonies, let's not forget where Ronald Reagan came from.Perhaps Mr. Reagan, who claimed that air pollution is caused by trees, is the man you should be quoting to back up your position that economics is more important than the Earth
But it was Frank Lloyd Wright who said, "Is this not Anti-Christ?The Moloch that knows no God but more?
Your editorial was commendable and neatly matched by the readers' comments in letters to the editor, "Alar: Scaring on the Side of Caution." The illogic and inaccuracy of John H.

In the opener, Sony Corp. would agree to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. in a transaction valued at close to $5 billion.Shortly after that, Sony would offer to buy Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. for $200 million and offer its co-chairmen, Peter Guber and Jon Peters, the chance to run Columbia
Shortly after that, Sony would offer to buy Guber-Peters Entertainment Co. for $200 million and offer its co-chairmen, Peter Guber and Jon Peters, the chance to run Columbia.Mr. Peters would fly to New York with the intention of telling Warner Communications Inc. Chairman Steven J. Ross that Guber-Peters planned to end its five-year contract to produce movies exclusively for Warner
That's where the two scripts would diverge.In affidavits filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in connection with the $1 billion breach-of-contract suit Warner brought against Sony for hiring the two producers, Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters tell one story.Warner tells another

Tomorrow, Warner will file another batch of documents contending that "the essence of everything these guys are saying is basically lies.Thursday, a judge is scheduled to rule on Warner's motion seeking to block the Guber-Peters duo from going to Columbia
The matter may never even be tried in court.Warner says that what it really wants is for the producers to fulfill their contractual obligations, but the bitterness of this battle and the accusations flying on both sides make it unlikely that the decade-long relationship between Warner and its two most prolific producers can ever be repaired
but the bitterness of this battle and the accusations flying on both sides make it unlikely that the decade-long relationship between Warner and its two most prolific producers can ever be repaired.it is willing to settle the matter out of court
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters don't have much to gain from a protracted battle.Sony, for its part, could decide that the cost of a Warner settlement or court fight is too high, choosing instead to find someone else to run Columbia
Sony, for its part, could decide that the cost of a Warner settlement or court fight is too high, choosing instead to find someone else to run Columbia, although that too would be costly given the financial arrangement already guaranteed to Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters.In that case, Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters might not suffer financially, but they would be left without their dream job of running a studio and with a considerably scarred relationship with Warner
but other murkier issues will play a big role.Sony and the Guber-Peters team are hanging much of their case on Warner's willingness last year to release the producers from another contract and on an oral agreement they say allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity to run a major studio came up
Sony and the Guber-Peters team are hanging much of their case on Warner's willingness last year to release the producers from another contract and on an oral agreement they say allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity to run a major studio came up.Warner denies such an agreement was made, and disputes the Guber-Peters version of virtually every telephone call and meeting the two sides had on the matter
Just how rancorous the relationship has become is clear from the differing versions of the two sides' current business dealings.Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters say in their affidavits that Warner already is taking steps to freeze them out of their projects at Warner, notably the Sylvester Stallone film "Tango and Cash
Mr. Peters says in his affidavit that the movie's staff was told last week that Warner was "taking over" the picture, and another producer would be giving all of the orders.Over his objections, Mr. Peters says, the film's release date was moved up "by many months" to December, and plans for a soundtrack "worth millions of dollars" were dropped

he told Mr. Guber he couldn't sign any documents and that "the deal, although apparently a good one for him and Mr. Peters, would have a very negative impact on Warner." He said he would contact Mr. Ross and Warner Brothers Chairman Robert Daly
But Sony is a problem.Warner is particularly concerned about the prospect of a huge Japanese company controlling important segments of the U.S. entertainment business
Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters took encouragement from Warner studio executives such as Mr. Semel and Mr. Canton too literally.According to this theory, Warner executives, hoping to strengthen their relationships with the producers, encouraged Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters in their ambitions to build a major entertainment company
the studio still wants the producers to come back and fulfill their contract. "They are like a mini-studio; they have 50 projects in development for Warner

The 1989 deficit would have been nearly $10 billion larger had the government been able to spend as much as Congress intended on cleaning up the thrift industry before the year ended on Sept. 30.Because the Resolution Trust Corp. couldn't spend the money fast enough, the savings-and-loan outlays were pushed into fiscal 1990
The law sets a deficit target of $100 billion for fiscal 1990.A partisan fight over cutting capital-gains taxes has slowed the progress of 1990 deficit-reduction legislation almost to a halt, triggering across-the-board spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law
The White House and the Democratic leadership in Congress blame each other for turning capital-gains taxes into such a divisive issue this year.Neither side showed any sign of retreating
In all, federal outlays amounted to $1.143 trillion in 1989, up 7.5% from the previous year.Federal revenues rose 9% to $990.79 billion
a surge in tax receipts noted earlier in the year didn't turn out to be quite as strong as it first appeared.The Treasury marked up its forecast by $17 million in July, but that proved to be about $5 billion too optimistic
Outlays for the month totaled $105.39 billion, up from $87.57 billion a year earlier.The increase reflects spending on the S&L rescue as well as payroll and Social Security checks normally issued in October that were issued in September this year because Oct. 1 fell on a Sunday

Polly Peck, a fast-growing British conglomerate, will pay 15.6 billion yen ($110 million) for 39 million new shares of Sansui, a well-known maker of high-fidelity audio equipment that failed to adjust to changing market conditions.Japanese government officials, eager to rebut foreign criticism of Japanese investments overseas, hailed the transaction as proof foreigners can make similar investments in Japan
Japanese government officials, eager to rebut foreign criticism of Japanese investments overseas, hailed the transaction as proof foreigners can make similar investments in Japan.Polly Peck's chairman, Asil Nadir, echoed the official Japanese view of the accord, which was announced Friday
Sansui is a special case.It expects to post a loss of 6.4 billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about 13.8 billion yen
But analysts say Sansui is a special case.It expects to post a loss of 6.4 billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about 13.8 billion yen. "If you find sound, healthy companies in Japan, they are not for sale
Nor do analysts expect the Sansui deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases.If the strong yen and the high stock prices of Japanese companies weren't deterrents enough, webs of cross-shareholdings between friendly Japanese companies and fiercely independent Japanese corporate attitudes repel most would-be acquirers
that this was not the company's finest hour.Sansui was once one of Japan's premier makers of expensive, high-quality stereo gear for audiophiles
Some of Sansui's fellow audio-specialty companies, such as Aiwa Co. and Pioneer Electric Corp., responded to the challenge by quickly bringing out mini-component products of their own, by moving heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or by diversifying into other consumer-electronics fields, including laser disks or portable cassette players.Sansui was late into the mini-component business and failed to branch into other new businesses
As the yen soared in recent years, Sansui's deepening financial problems became a vicious circle.While competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of Japanese factories, Sansui lacked the money to build new plants in Southeast Asia
Sansui lacked the money to build new plants in Southeast Asia. "Our company has not been able to cope very effectively with" changes in the marketplace

Attitudes {toward being acquired} are still negative, but they're becoming more positive.In some industries, like pharmaceuticals, acquisitions make sense
Mr. Nadir brimmed with self-confidence that he can turn Sansui around.Sansui is a perfect fit for Polly Peck's electronics operations, which make televisions, videocassette recorders, microwaves and other products on an "original equipment maker" basis for sale under other companies' brand names
Such risk taking is an everyday matter for the brash Mr. Nadir, who is 25% owner of Polly Peck as well as its chairman.He took Polly Peck, once a small fabric wholesaler, and used it at as a base to build a conglomerate that has been doubling its profits annually since 1980

forcing huge debt on the proposed new company.The debt, estimated at $4.7 billion, could mortgage the cellular company's future earning power in order to placate some LIN holders in the short term
But under new terms of the agreement, announced Friday, LIN holders would receive a special cash dividend of $42 a share, representing a payout of about $2.23 billion, shortly before the proposed merger.LIN said it expects to borrow the money to pay the dividend, but commitments from banks still haven't been obtained
LIN said it expects to borrow the money to pay the dividend, but commitments from banks still haven't been obtained.Under previous terms, holders would have received a dividend of only $20 a share
That money also would have to be borrowed.In effect, McCaw has forced LIN's hand by bidding $1.9 billion for the stake earlier this month
We're taking on more debt than we would have liked to.that the company wouldn't be profitable until 1994 or later

Under its revised proposal, Atlanta-based BellSouth would have a 50% interest in the new cellular company and would be responsible for half of its debt.To sweeten the pact further -- and to ease concerns of institutional investors -- BellSouth added a provision designed to give extra protection to holders if the regional Bell company ever decides to buy the rest of the new cellular company
To sweeten the pact further -- and to ease concerns of institutional investors -- BellSouth added a provision designed to give extra protection to holders if the regional Bell company ever decides to buy the rest of the new cellular company.The provision, described as "back-end" protection, would require BellSouth to pay a price equivalent to what an outside party might have to pay
McCaw's bid also has a similar clause.Only McCaw's proposal requires the company to begin an auction process in June 1994 for remaining shares at third-party prices
We're very pleased with the new deal.We didn't expect BellSouth to be so responsive
BellSouth's "back-end protection was flawed previously.We think this is a superior deal to McCaw's
this is a superior deal to McCaw's.We're surprised
We're surprised.We didn't think a sleeping {Bell} mentality would be willing to take on dilution
But Kenneth Leon, a telecommunications analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co., finds the BellSouth proposal still flawed because the company doesn't have to wait five years to begin buying more LIN shares. "How many shares will be around in 1995
How many shares will be around in 1995?.There's nothing preventing BellSouth from buying up shares in the meanwhile
BellSouth's revised proposal surprised many industry analysts, especially because of the company's willingness to accept some dilution of future earnings.the revised agreement with LIN would dilute BellSouth earnings by about 9% in both 1990 and 1991 and by significantly less thereafter
For 1988, BellSouth earned $1.7 billion, or $3.51 a share, on revenue of $13.6 billion.Analysts were predicting 1990 BellSouth earnings in the range of $3.90 a share, or $1.9 billion, but now those estimates are being scaled back
Indeed, McCaw seemed to hint at that option in a brief statement.Urging LIN directors to conduct "a fair auction on a level playing field," McCaw asked how well the public interest would be served "with the Bell operating companies controlling over 94% of all cellular {potential customers} in the nation's top 10 markets
Their motivation, however, has a strong practical aspect: Program trading is hazardous to their paychecks.The most controversial form of program trading, stock-index arbitrage, is "making it tough for traders to make money
Stock-index arbitrage -- the computer-guided buying and selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies -- affects the OTC market directly through the 31 stocks included in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.The S&P 500 is often used in arbitrage strategies
The portion of OTC volume attributable to program trading isn't known, as it is on the New York Stock Exchange, where it amounted to more than 13% in September.Estimates from traders put it at less than 5% of Nasdaq's average daily volume of roughly 133 million shares
Other market-maker gripes: Program trading also causes the Nasdaq Composite Index to lose ground against other segments of the stock market.Because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many OTC stocks without sharp price moves, a condition known as illiquidity
they do so only for customers, however.Kidder Peabody does program trading for its own as well as clients' accounts
That's largely because of defensive measures they adopted after the 1987 crash, when individual investors fled the market and trading activity dwindled.Market makers, to cut costs, slashed inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when other holders aren't selling
market makers became quicker to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress.On days when prices are tumbling, they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will

Mr. Perry paused to scan the crowd. "I see we have about half the audience working for us," he said, tongue in cheek
I see we have about half the audience working for us.The other half, we may have before long
Members of the audience gasped or laughed nervously; their industry has been unsettled recently by acquisitions
First Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch packaged-goods giant, spent $2 billion to acquire brands such as Faberge and Elizabeth Arden.It now holds the No. 3 position at U.S. department-store cosmetic counters
Then Procter & Gamble Co. agreed to buy Noxell Corp. for $1.3 billion.That acquisition, to be completed by year end, will include the Cover Girl and Clarion makeup lines, making P&G the top marketer of cosmetics in mass-market outlets
P&G and Unilever bring with them great experience with mundane products like soap and toilet paper, sparking disdain in the glitzy cosmetics trade; but they also bring mammoth marketing clout, sparking fear.Though it is far from certain that companies best known for selling Promise margarine and Tide detergent will succeed in cosmetics, there's little doubt they will shake up the industry
to blend the methodical marketing strategies they use for more mundane products with the more intuitive approach typical of cosmetics companies.Likely changes include more emphasis on research, soaring advertising budgets and aggressive pricing
But some cosmetics-industry executives wonder whether techniques honed in packaged goods will translate to the cosmetics business.Estee Lauder Inc., Revlon Inc. and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development is guided by the creative intuition of their executives
Estee Lauder Inc., Revlon Inc. and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development is guided by the creative intuition of their executives.Cosmetics companies roll out new makeup colors several times a year, and since most products can be easily copied by competitors, they're loath to test them with consumers
Just because upscale cosmetics look like packaged goods and smell like packaged goods, it doesn't mean they are packaged goods.They're really fashion items wrapped up in little jars
Unilever and P&G are the habitats of organization men in gray-flannel suits.Both companies are conservative marketers that rely on extensive market research
Both companies are conservative marketers that rely on extensive market research.P&G, in particular, rarely rolls out a product nationally before extensive test-marketing.Both can be extremely aggressive at pricing such products as soaps and diapers -- to the extent that some industry consultants predict cents-off coupons for mascara could result from their entry into the field
P&G already has shown it can meld some traditional packaged-goods techniques with the image-making of the cosmetics trade in the mass-market end of the business.Consider Oil of Olay, which P&G acquired as part of Richardson-Vicks International in 1985
Consider Oil of Olay, which P&G acquired as part of Richardson-Vicks International in 1985.The moisturizer, introduced in 1962, had a dowdy image
The moisturizer, introduced in 1962, had a dowdy image. "Oil of Olay brought with it the baggage of being used basically by older women who had already aged
P&G set out to reposition the brand by broadening the product line to include facial cleansers and moisturizers for sensitive skin.It also redesigned Oil of Olay's packaging, stamping the traditional pink boxes with gold lines to create a more opulent look.Moreover, P&G shifted its ad campaign from one targeting older women to one featuring a woman in her mid-30s vowing "not to grow old gracefully." The company says sales have soared
Goliaths like Unilever and P&G have enormous financial advantages over smaller rivals.Next year, Noxell plans to roll out a perfume called Navy
Next year, Noxell plans to roll out a perfume called Navy.Without P&G's backing, Noxell might not have been able to spend the estimated $5 million to $7 million needed to accomplish that without scrimping on its existing brands

Further consolidations in the industry could follow.Rumors that Unilever is interested in acquiring Schering-Plough Corp. 's Maybelline unit are widespread
Rumors that Unilever is interested in acquiring Schering-Plough Corp. 's Maybelline unit are widespread.Unilever won't comment
The presence of Unilever and P&G is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics.While the two are among the world's biggest advertisers, most makers of upscale cosmetics spend relatively little on national ads
Nearly 70% of cosmetics sales come through mass-distribution outlets such as drug stores and supermarkets, according to Andrew Shore, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.That figure has been inching up for several years
That figure has been inching up for several years.As the trend continues, demand for mass-market items that are high quality but only mid-priced -- particularly skin-care products -- is expected to increase
The packaged-goods marketers may try filling that gap with a spate of new products.Unlike the old-line cosmetics houses, Unilever and P&G both have enormous research and development bases to draw on for new products
that future product development will be driven more by technological innovation than by fashion whims -- especially among mass-market brands. "There will be more emphasis on quality
There will be more emphasis on quality.You'll see fewer gimmicks
But success for Unilever and P&G is far from guaranteed, as shown by the many consumer-product companies that have tried and failed to master the quirky beauty business.In the 1970s, several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods companies, including Colgate-Palmolive Co., Eli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc. and Schering-Plough acquired cosmetics companies
In the 1970s, several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods companies, including Colgate-Palmolive Co., Eli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc. and Schering-Plough acquired cosmetics companies.only Schering-Plough, which makes the mass-market Maybelline, has maintained a meaningful business
only Schering-Plough, which makes the mass-market Maybelline, has maintained a meaningful business.Colgate, which acquired Helena Rubenstein in 1973, sold the brand seven years later after the brand languished
Unilever already has experienced some disappointment.The mass-market Aziza brand, which it acquired in 1987 along with Chesebrough-Pond's Inc., has lost share, according to industry analysts
The ritzy world of department-store cosmetics retailing, where Unilever is concentrating its efforts, may prove even more treacherous.In this niche, makeup colors change seasonally because they are linked to ready-to-wear fashions
In this niche, makeup colors change seasonally because they are linked to ready-to-wear fashions.Because brand loyalty is weak and most cosmetics purchases are unplanned, careful training of store sales staffs by cosmetics companies is important
After years of mistrust born of Watergate, past misdeeds of the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Iran-Contra scandal, President Bush and the Senate Intelligence Committee appear ready -- for now, at least -- to trust each other when it comes to setting policy on covert activities.If that attitude lasts, it could infuse covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that hasn't been seen in years
Over the past week, the president has agreed to keep the committee informed, usually in advance, of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing.That wasn't always the way the Reagan administration handled such matters
Mr. Bush has pledged as well to respect the 14-year-old executive order barring U.S. agents from assassinating foreign leaders or helping others to do so.Congress never fully trusted former CIA chief William Casey and National Security Adviser John Poindexter to honor the ban
The new understanding didn't just spring to life in a spontaneous eruption of sweetness and light.It emerged after a rancorous display of old-style intelligence politics that followed this month's failed coup attempt in Panama
that congressionally imposed restrictions on covert actions made U.S. support for such coups difficult.that one Reagan-era deal with Congress required him to notify the odious Panamanian dictator, Manuel Noriega, if the U.S. learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life
The senators responded in kind.Sen. Boren happily told reporters that there had been "a meeting of the minds" with the White House, and that the committee had given Mr. Bush "a clean slate," free of the impediments imposed during the Reagan years
Sen. Boren happily told reporters that there had been "a meeting of the minds" with the White House, and that the committee had given Mr. Bush "a clean slate," free of the impediments imposed during the Reagan years.Sen. Cohen said the relationship has reverted to its pre-Reagan character
There still are some details to be nailed down.Mr. Bush is reserving the right in "rare" instances to keep Congress in the dark, asserting a constitutional prerogative the committee doesn't recognize
Moreover, both sides may face political critics.Some conservatives will accuse the president of promising Congress too much
Margaret Thatcher's instinctive response to the latest upheaval in her government is to promise business as usual.That may be the last thing she needs
the government faces a daunting job of rebuilding confidence in its policies.The prime minister and her new chancellor of the exchequer, the untested John Major, need to haul the country through something like a recession to bring down inflation and set the economy moving again
The prime minister and her new chancellor of the exchequer, the untested John Major, need to haul the country through something like a recession to bring down inflation and set the economy moving again.Mrs. Thatcher has to come to terms with European economic integration, beginning with the European Monetary System, which Britain is committed to joining fully someday
It sounds like the work of a decade, but the deadline is late 1991, when Mrs. Thatcher is expected to call another national election.that the economic cycle may be out of kilter with the political timetable
that the economic cycle may be out of kilter with the political timetable.She could end up seeking a fourth term in an economy sick with inflation, high interest rates and a heavy trade deficit
supporters wonder if her steely, autocratic ways are the right formula today. "There's a rising fear that perhaps Mrs. Thatcher's style of management has become a political liability
The prime minister's insistence on keeping a private coterie of advisers -- including an economic guru who openly criticized former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson -- confused the financial community.Last week, the strategy of playing the two experts off each other blew up: Mr. Lawson quit in exasperation and Sir Alan Walters, the adviser, announced his resignation within an hour
The confusion could be costly.Currency traders, suspecting Mr. Major won't defend the pound strenuously, sent the British currency sharply lower Friday against the dollar and West German mark
Currency traders, suspecting Mr. Major won't defend the pound strenuously, sent the British currency sharply lower Friday against the dollar and West German mark.Analysts expect further jitters this week
A continuing slide in the pound could force the government to push through another rise in the base rate, currently 15%.That could shove a weak economy into recession
That could shove a weak economy into recession.Economists have been anticipating a slump for months, but they now say it will be deeper and longer than they had thought
but they now say it will be deeper and longer than they had thought.Britain's economy "is developing rapidly toward no-growth
A mild slowdown probably would have run its course by early 1991 while the grueling downturn now expected could stretch into 1992.Recovery could be hampered if Britain's major trading partners in Europe, which are enjoying robust economic activity, cool off as expected in late 1990 and 1991
That would leave Mrs. Thatcher little room for maneuver.For the Tories to win the next election, voters will need to sense economic improvement for about a year beforehand

There's an equally pressing deadline for the government to define its monetary and economic ties to the rest of the European Community.It has sent mixed signals about its willingness to take part in the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System
It has sent mixed signals about its willingness to take part in the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.At a June EC summit, Mrs. Thatcher appeared to ease her opposition to full EMS membership, saying Britain would join once its inflation rate fell and the EC liberalized capital movements
Since then, the government has left observers wondering if it ever meant to join.Sir Alan assailed the monetary arrangement as "half-baked" in an article being published in an American economics journal
Sir Alan assailed the monetary arrangement as "half-baked" in an article being published in an American economics journal.That produced little reaction from his boss, reinforcing speculation the government would use its two conditions as a pretext for avoiding full EMS membership
Despite the departure of Mr. Lawson and Sir Alan, the tug-of-war over the EMS could continue.Sir Geoffrey Howe, deputy prime minister and a Lawson ally on the EMS, has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership
Of immediate concern is whether the Thatcher government will continue Mr. Lawson's policy of tracking the monetary policies of the West German Bundesbank and responding in kind when the Frankfurt authorities move interest rates.Mrs. Thatcher "doesn't like taking orders from foreigners
As Conservatives rally around Mrs. Thatcher during the crisis, many harbor hopes last week's debacle will prompt change. "We won't have any more of this wayward behavior," says Sir Peter Hordern, a backbench Tory member of Parliament
We won't have any more of this wayward behavior.The party is fed up with sackings of good people
It's an unrealistic expectation.As long as a decade ago, Mrs. Thatcher declared she didn't want debate in her cabinet; she wanted strong government

Rand Corp. researchers Linda Waite and Frances Goldscheider analyzed a large sample of married women with at least one child at home between the ages of six and 18.The women indicated which family member usually did various household chores and the approximate share each did
Not unexpectedly, wives, whether working or non-working, did by far the most -- about 80% of the shopping, laundry and cooking, and about two-thirds of housecleaning, washing dishes, child care and family paper work.Only for yardwork and home maintenance did women do less than half
This pattern was particularly evident among more highly educated couples.In these families, husbands took on 80% more chores than in couples with only grammar school education
It is clear that most of the effect of increasing education has been to shift who is helping the wife/mother.Her share decreases, but only slightly
State governments place very low ceilings on how much property people may own or how much income they may keep if they want welfare help on medical bills.Conventional wisdom has long held that anywhere from one-fourth to one-half of all elderly long-term care patients are obliged to spend themselves into poverty before qualifying for Medicaid assistance
that "a surprisingly small proportion" -- only about 10% -- of residents start out as private payers but "spend down" to Medicaid levels in a single nursing home stay before they die or are discharged. (Another one-third are already on Medicaid when they enter the nursing homes, a considerably higher proportion than the analysts anticipated
But a remarkably high percentage -- over half -- are private payers throughout their stay, even a fairly lengthy one.About one-third pay out of their own pockets, while the rest are covered throughout by Medicare, private insurers or the Veterans Administration
For example, 66% of the 18 to 24 year olds in the four latest surveys favored an "open housing" law prohibiting homeowners from refusing on racial grounds to sell to prospective buyers.That compares with 58% of the similar age group in the 1980 through 1982 surveys and 55% in the 1972 through 1975 surveys

October was an edgy month for the practitioners of glasnost, the official Soviet policy of allowing more candor from the nation's media.For one of the superstars of glasnost, Vitaly Korotich, editor of the trail-blazing weekly Ogonyok, Friday, Oct. 20 was a somersaulting day that turned from tension to elation

In fact, a very high-ranking Soviet official told an American official at a diplomatic dinner that no change in the policy was contemplated.The day after that conversation at the residence of the U.S. ambassador, the Brezhnevite editor of Pravda, Victor Afnasjev, was replaced by a college classmate of Mr. Gorbachev's
The day after that conversation at the residence of the U.S. ambassador, the Brezhnevite editor of Pravda, Victor Afnasjev, was replaced by a college classmate of Mr. Gorbachev's.Brezhnevite holdovers have more to fear from Mr. Gorbachev than the verbal spanking he gave to the press
A good measurement of the popularity of ice-breaker journals like Ogonyok is circulation.When Mr. Korotich took it over in 1986, it sold 250,000 copies; today it sells 3.4 million
When Mr. Korotich took it over in 1986, it sold 250,000 copies; today it sells 3.4 million
Glasnost has made celebrities of men like Mr. Korotich.Prevented by the Communist Party from getting on its slate of nominees for the new Supreme Soviet, he stood as an independent candidate for Congress from his native Ukraine and won with 84% of the vote
Prevented by the Communist Party from getting on its slate of nominees for the new Supreme Soviet, he stood as an independent candidate for Congress from his native Ukraine and won with 84% of the vote.The same evening that he was summoned for a warning from the Party, he was cheered by thousands of his supporters at a rally of what can only be called the Korotich party
But as astounding as the changes that have already occurred are, there is a fragility to glasnost.Censorship isn't a Marxist invention

It is an admirable public relations program initiated by a single political leader during a four-year blink of history.It is public relations of the highest sophistication, that recognizes that credibility is enhanced by honesty -- up to a point
What is that point?Will Ogonyok begin a series of reports analyzing the failures of perestroika

I'd be destroying myself," replies Mr. Korotich, who then asks, "What would that accomplish?" His answer reveals his vulnerability
it also draws the line that Soviet society must cross to enter the normal dialogue of Western culture.It is the line beyond which the press can report not only on the bankruptcy of factories but on the failures of even admirable leaders

Federal Reserve critics used to complain of "stop and go" monetary policies.that the Fed would first give a green light to the economy by making credit readily available and then turn on the red and bring growth to a screeching halt
But under Alan Greenspan that has changed.A supremely cautious man, the Fed chairman is forever blinking yellow
Indeed, his caution has become legendary within the government.He fusses endlessly over economic statistics, dissecting them in dozens of ways, probing for hours in search of potential problems
He fusses endlessly over economic statistics, dissecting them in dozens of ways, probing for hours in search of potential problems.After thoroughly digesting reams of information, he often concludes that more data are needed
Such caution was evident after the recent Friday-the-13th stock market plunge.Some Bush administration officials urged Mr. Greenspan to make an immediate public announcement of his plans to provide ample credit to the markets
Mr. Greenspan's decision to keep quiet also prompted a near-mutiny within the Fed's ranks.A "senior Fed official" spoke on Saturday after the market swoon to both the Washington Post and the New York Times, saying the Fed was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed

And, while the mutinous Fed member hasn't gone public, some Fed governors, most notably Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson, are known to have disagreed with the chairman's decision to remain silent.Ironically, the anonymous official's comments have earned some plaudits for Mr. Greenspan
Ironically, the anonymous official's comments have earned some plaudits for Mr. Greenspan.At a hearing last week, Democratic Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut told Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady that "Chairman Greenspan's" announcement over the Oct. 13 weekend was a "very important statement
Chairman Greenspan's" announcement over the Oct. 13 weekend was a "very important statement.that he wasn't sure whether Mr. Greenspan "made a statement himself, or whether that was a newspaper report
when the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets.A surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system
Bush administration officials appear increasingly concerned that Mr. Greenspan is cautious to a fault.Signs of growing weakness in the economy, paired with indications that inflation is staying well under control, have caused them to wonder why the Fed chairman is so grudging in reducing rates
The administration's concerns are understandable.The economy is showing signs of weakness, particularly among manufacturers

Exports, which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years, seem to have stalled.Factory payrolls and production fell in September
In addition, the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road.Inflation may be stable at the moment, running at about 4.5%.But if the Fed eases too soon, Mr. Greenspan fears, prices may begin to accelerate again next year
So far, Mr. Greenspan's cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well.His hand on the monetary tiller seems one reason why the economy next month seems highly likely to begin an unprecedented eighth year of peacetime growth without a recession

the federal judiciary is one of the last bastions of the generalist.A judge must jump from murder to antitrust cases, from arson to securities fraud, without missing a beat
A new specialty court was sought by patent experts, who believed that the generalists had botched too many important, multimillion-dollar cases.Some patent lawyers had hoped that such a specialty court would be filled with experts in the field
Now only three of the 12 judges have patent-law backgrounds.The latter two and Judge Daniel M. Friedman, 73, are approaching senior status or retirement
so patent lawyers and research-based industries are making a new push for specialists to be added to the court.Several organizations, including the Industrial Biotechnical Association and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, have asked the White House and Justice Department to name candidates with both patent and scientific backgrounds
Several organizations, including the Industrial Biotechnical Association and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, have asked the White House and Justice Department to name candidates with both patent and scientific backgrounds.The associations would like the court to include between three and six judges with specialized training
Some of the associations have recommended Dr. Alan D. Lourie, 54, a former patent agent with a doctorate in organic chemistry who now is associate general counsel with SmithKline Beckman Corp. in Philadelphia.Dr. Lourie says the Justice Department interviewed him last July
Their effort has received a lukewarm response from the Justice Department. "We do not feel that seats are reserved (for patent lawyers)
The Justice Department's view is shared by other lawyers and at least one member of the court, Judge H. Robert Mayer.I believe that any good lawyer should be able to figure out and understand patent law
Yet some lawyers point to Eli Lilly & Co. vs.Medtronic, Inc., the patent infringement case the Supreme Court this month agreed to review, as.Judge Mayer was not on the three-member panel
In the Lilly case, the appeals court broadly construed a federal statute to grant Medtronic, a medical device manufacturer, an exemption to infringe a patent under certain circumstances.If the Supreme Court holds in Medtronic's favor, the decision will have billion-dollar consequences for the manufacturers of medical devices, color and food additives and all other non-drug products that required Food & Drug Administration approval

THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD'S coming rule on disclosure involving financial instruments will be effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after June 15, 1990.The date was misstated in Friday's edition
Only a few months ago, the 124-year-old securities firm seemed to be on the verge of a meltdown, racked by internal squabbles and defections.Its relationship with parent General Electric Co. had been frayed since a big Kidder insider-trading scandal two years ago
Its relationship with parent General Electric Co. had been frayed since a big Kidder insider-trading scandal two years ago.Chief executives and presidents had come and gone
it's at a turning point.By the end of this year, 63-year-old Chairman Silas Cathcart -- the former chairman of Illinois Tool Works who was derided as a "tool-and-die man" when GE brought him in to clean up Kidder in 1987 -- retires to his Lake Forest, Ill., home, possibly to build a shopping mall on some land he owns

Wall Street is understandably skeptical.Through the first nine months of the year, Kidder ranks a distant 10th among underwriters of U.S. stocks and bonds, with a 2.8% market share, up slightly from 2.5% in the year-earlier period, according to Securities Data Co

In 1988, Kidder eked out a $46 million profit, mainly because of severe cost cutting.Its 1,400-member brokerage operation reported an estimated $5 million loss last year
In fact, Kidder is a minor player in just about every business it does except computer-driven program trading; in that controversial business, only Morgan Stanley & Co. rivals Kidder

Mr. Carpenter says that when he assumes full control, Kidder will finally tap the resources of GE.One of GE's goals when it bought 80% of Kidder in 1986 was to take advantage of "syngeries" between Kidder and General Electric Capital Corp., GE's corporate-finance unit, which has $42 billion in assets

Yet, says Mr. Carpenter, "We've really started to exploit the synergy between GE Capital and Kidder Peabody." The units have worked on 37 investment banking deals this year though not all of them have panned out
We've had a good relationship with GE, which is the first time you could say that -- uh, let me withdraw that.It's been a steadily improving relationship
A month ago, the firm started serving dinner at about 7:30 each night; about 50 to 60 of the 350 people in the investment banking operation have consistently been around that late
Everywhere, Kidder stresses the "always working" theme.A new in-house magazine, Kidder World -- which will focus on the firm's synergy strategy, says Mr. Carpenter -- confides that on weekends Mr. Newquist "often gets value-added ideas while flying his single-engine Cessna Centurion on the way to Nantucket

As part of the upscale push, Kidder is putting brokers through a 20-week training course, turning them into "investment counselors" with knowledge of corporate finance.They will get "new and improved tools to sell, particularly to the affluent investor
The departing Mr. Cathcart says he has no worries about Kidder's future.Mr. Cathcart, who will return to the Quaker Oats Co. board of directors, in addition to his personal ventures, is credited with bringing some basic budgeting and planning discipline to traditionally free-wheeling Kidder

Taiwan's USI Far East Corp., a petrochemical company, initialed the agreement with an unidentified Japanese contractor to build a naphtha cracker, according to Alson Lee, who heads the Philippine company set up to build and operate the complex.Mr. Lee, president of Luzon Petrochemical Corp., said the contract was signed Wednesday in Tokyo with USI Far East officials
The proposed petrochemical plant would use naphtha to manufacture the petrochemicals propylene and ethylene and their resin derivatives, polypropylene and polyethylene.These are the raw materials used in making plastics
The contract signing represented a major step in the long-planned petrochemical project.At an estimated $360 million, the project would represent the single largest foreign investment in the Philippines since President Corazon Aquino took office in February 1986
It also is considered critical to the country's efforts to both attract other investment from Taiwan and raise heavy industry capabilities.The project has been in and out of the pipeline for more than a decade
However, workers can't break ground until legal maneuvers to block the complex are resolved, moves which caused the signing to remain questionable up to the last moment.a member of the Philippines' House of Representatives has sued to stop the plant

THE YALE POLITICAL UNION doesn't pay an honorarium to speakers.In Thursday's edition, it was incorrectly indicated that the union had paid a fee to former House Speaker Jim Wright
it would be a great tool for curbing the budget deficit and slicing the lard out of government programs.He wants it now
Not so fast.I consider it one of the stupidest ideas of the 20th century
It's the line-item veto, a procedure that would allow the president to kill individual items in a big spending bill passed by Congress without vetoing the entire bill.Whatever one thinks of the idea, it's far more than the budgetary gimmick it may seem at first glance
President Bush badly wants a line-item veto and has long called for a law giving it to the president.that he might not rely on Congress to pass the line-item veto law he seeks
that he might not rely on Congress -- which hasn't shown any willingness to surrender such authority -- to pass the line-item veto law he seeks.Mr. Bush is considering simply declaring that the Constitution gives him the power, exercising a line-item veto and inviting a court challenge to decide whether he has the right
Although that may sound like an arcane maneuver of little interest outside Washington, it would set off a political earthquake. "The ramifications are enormous
The ramifications are enormous.It's a real face-to-face arm wrestling challenge to Congress
and for that reason, the president may back down from launching a test case this year.Some senior advisers argue that with further fights over a capital-gains tax cut and a budget-reduction bill looming, Mr. Bush already has enough pending confrontations with Congress
Some senior advisers argue that with further fights over a capital-gains tax cut and a budget-reduction bill looming, Mr. Bush already has enough pending confrontations with Congress.They prefer to put off the line-item veto until at least next year
Still, Mr. Bush and some other aides are strongly drawn to the idea of trying out a line-item veto.The issue arose last week when Vice President Dan Quayle told an audience in Chicago that Mr. Bush was looking for a test case
when Vice President Dan Quayle told an audience in Chicago that Mr. Bush was looking for a test case.White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater confirmed that Mr. Bush was interested in the idea
that a line-item veto would go a long way in restoring discipline to the budget process.that a president needs the ability to surgically remove pork-barrel spending projects that are attached to big omnibus spending bills
that a president needs the ability to surgically remove pork-barrel spending projects that are attached to big omnibus spending bills.Those bills can't easily be vetoed in their entirety because they often are needed to keep the government operating
Conservatives note that 43 governors have the line-item veto to use on state budgets.More provocatively, some conservative legal theorists have begun arguing that Mr. Bush doesn't need to wait for a law giving him the veto because the power already is implicit in the Constitution
and that it would quickly make its way to the Supreme Court to be ultimately resolved. "It's a major issue, and they wouldn't want to leave it at a lower level
a line-item veto would expand a president's powers far beyond anything the framers of the Constitution had in mind. "It puts this president in the legislative business
It puts this president in the legislative business.That's not what our fathers had in mind
that, as a lawmaker from the San Francisco area, he fights each year to preserve federal funds for the Bay Area Rapid Transit system.If a president had a line-item veto and wanted to force him to support a controversial foreign-policy initiative the president could call and declare that he would single-handedly kill the BART funds unless the congressman "shapes up" on the foreign-policy issue
But there may be another problem with the device: Despite all the political angst it would cause, it mightn't be effective in cutting the deficit.Big chunks of the government budget, like the entitlement programs of Social Security and Medicare, wouldn't be affected
Big chunks of the government budget, like the entitlement programs of Social Security and Medicare, wouldn't be affected.Governors have found that they have to use the device sparingly to maintain political comity
that the veto would have what Mr. Glazier calls an important "chilling effect" on all manner of appropriations bills.Lawmakers would avoid putting many spending projects into legislation in the first place for fear of the embarrassment of having them singled out for a line-item veto later
Whatever the outcome of a test case, President Bush would have to move cautiously becase the very attempt would "antagonize not just Democrats but Republicans.Republicans have as much interest as Democrats in "the way the system works
Indeed, although a majority of Republican lawmakers favor a line-item veto, some, ranging from liberal Oregon Sen. Mark Hatfield to conservative Rep. Edwards are opposed.Rep. Edwards voices the traditional conservative view that it's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person
that it's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person.Conservatives pushing for a line-item veto now may regret it later
This hasn't been Kellogg Co. 's year.The oat-bran craze has cost the world's largest cereal maker market share.The company's president quit suddenly.And now Kellogg is indefinitely suspending work on what was to be a $1 billion cereal plant
The oat-bran craze has cost the world's largest cereal maker market share.The company's president quit suddenly
Kellogg, which hasn't been as successful in capitalizing on the public's health-oriented desire for oat bran as rival General Mills Inc., has been losing share in the $6 billion ready-to-eat cereal market.Kellogg's current share is believed to be slightly under 40% while General Mills' share is about 27%
Led by its oat-based Cheerios line, General Mills has gained an estimated 2% share so far this year, mostly at the expense of Kellogg.Each share point is worth about $60 million in sales
much of Kellogg's erosion has been in such core brands as Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies and Frosted Flakes, which represent nearly one-third of its sales volume.Kellogg is so anxious to turn around Corn Flakes sales that it soon will begin selling boxes for as little as 99 cents
Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios have eaten away sales normally going to Kellogg's corn-based lines simply because they are made of oats.They are not a happy group of people at Battle Creek right now
They are not a happy group of people at Battle Creek right now." Kellogg is based in Battle Creek, Mich., a city that calls itself the breakfast capital of the world
Another analyst, John C. Maxwell Jr. of Wheat, First Securities in Richmond, Va., recently went to a "sell" recommendation on Kellogg stock, which closed Friday at $71.75, down 75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. "I don't think Kellogg can get back to 40% this year

Cereal volume growth in the U.S. has not met our expectations for 1989." He said construction wouldn't resume until market conditions warrant it
Kellogg indicated that it has room to grow without adding facilities.The company has five other U.S. plants, including a modern facility at its Battle Creek headquarters known as Building 100
General Mills, meanwhile, finds itself constrained from boosting sales further because its plants are operating at capacity.A large plant in Covington, Ga., is to come on line next year
A Kellogg officer, who asked not to be named, said the Memphis project was "pulled in for a reconsideration of costs," an indication that the ambitious plans might be scaled back in any future construction.Initial cost estimates for the plant, which was to have been built in phases, ranged from $1 billion to $1.2 billion
it was "possible, but highly unlikely," that the plant might never be built. "As we regain our leadership level where we have been, and as we continue to put new products into the marketplace and need additional capacity, we will look at resuming our involvement with our plan
The new facility was to have been the world's most advanced cereal manufacturing plant, and Kellogg's largest construction project.The company had retained the Fluor Daniel unit of Fluor Corp. as general contractor
But in recent weeks, construction-industry sources reported that early preparation work was slowing at the 185-acre site.Subcontractors said they were told that equipment orders would be delayed
they were told that equipment orders would be delayed.Fluor Daniel already has reassigned most of its work crew
Last Friday's announcement was the first official word that the project was in trouble and that the company's plans for a surge in market share may have been overly optimistic.Until recently, Kellogg had been telling its sales force and Wall Street that by 1992 it intended to achieve a 50% share of market, measured in dollar volume
an earnings increase for the full year.Last year, the company earned $480.4 million, or $3.90 a share, on sales of $4.3 billion

Harry J. Pearce, named general counsel in May 1987, says the reduction is a cost-cutting measure and an effort to let the No. 1 auto maker's 134-lawyer in-house legal department take on matters it is better equipped and trained to handle.GM trimmed about 40 firms from its approved local counsel list, Mr. Pearce says

That's a finding of a new study of the Justice Department by researchers at Syracuse University.fewer trials probably means a growing number of plea bargains
David Burnham, one of the authors, says fewer trials probably means a growing number of plea bargains.In 1980, 18% of federal prosecutions concluded at trial; in 1987, only 9% did
The Justice Department rejected the implication that its prosecutors are currently more willing to plea bargain. "Our felony caseloads have been consistent for 20 years," with about 15% of all prosecutions going to trial, a department spokeswoman said
Our felony caseloads have been consistent for 20 years," with about 15% of all prosecutions going to trial.The discrepancy is somewhat perplexing in that the Syracuse researchers said they based their conclusions on government statistics
In 1980 prosecutors surveyed filed charges against 25 defendants for each 100,000 people aged 18 years and older.In 1987, prosecutors filed against 35 defendants for every 100,000 adults
Prosecutors set significantly different priorities.The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office stressed criminal cases from 1980 to 1987, averaging 43 for every 100,000 adults.But the New Jersey U.S. attorney averaged 16.On the civil side, the Manhattan prosecutor filed an average of only 11 cases for every 100,000 adults during the same period; the San Francisco U.S. attorney averaged 79

The former first lady of the Philippines, asked a federal court in Manhattan to dismiss an indictment against her, claiming among other things, that she was abducted from her homeland.Mrs. Marcos and her late husband, former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos, were charged with embezzling more than $100 million from that country and then fraudulently concealing much of the money through purchases of prime real estate in Manhattan
Mrs. Marcos's attorneys asked federal Judge John F. Keenan to give them access to all U.S. documents about her alleged abduction.Mrs. Marcos was making the "fanciful -- and factually unsupported -- claim that she was kidnapped into this country" in order to obtain classified material in the case

THE FEDERAL COURT of appeals in Manhattan ruled that the dismissal of a 1980 indictment against former Bank of Crete owner George Koskotas should be reconsidered.The indictment, which was sealed and apparently forgotten by investigators until 1987, charges Mr. Koskotas and three others with tax fraud and other violations

In an effort to stave off a plan that would require all lawyers in New York state to provide twenty hours of free legal aid a year, the state bar recommended an alternative program to increase voluntary participation in pro bono programs.The state bar association's policy making body, the House of Delegate, voted Saturday to ask Chief Judge Sol Wachtler to give the bar's voluntary program three years to prove its effectiveness before considering mandatory pro bono

Several other reports come before Friday's jobs data, including: the September leading indicators index, new-home sales and October agricultural prices reports due out tomorrow; the October purchasing managers' index and September construction spending and manufacturers' orders on Wednesday; and October chain-store sales on Thursday.Friday brings the final count on October auto sales
that next month's data isn't likely to be much better, because it will be distorted by San Francisco's earthquake.seasonal swings in the auto industry this year aren't occurring at the same time as in the past, because of production and pricing differences that are curbing the accuracy of seasonal adjustments built into the employment data
Wednesday's report from the purchasing agents will be watched to see if the index maintains a level below 50%, as it has for the past couple of months.A reading of less than 50% indicates an economy that is generally contracting while a reading above 50% indicates an economy that's expanding

September orders for machine tools rebounded from the summer doldrums, but remained 7.7% below year-earlier levels, according to figures from NMTBA.Domestic machine tool plants received $303 million of orders last month, up 33% from August's $227.1 million, but still below the $328.2 million of September 1988
Overall demand still is very respectable.The outlook is positive for the intermediate to long term

At a recent meeting of manufacturing executives, "everybody I talked with was very positive.they plan to spend more on factory equipment in 1990 than in 1989
But sales of North American-made 1990-model cars are running at an annual rate of only six million, down from 7.1 million a year earlier.And truck sales also are off more than 20%.Auto makers, who began deferring some equipment purchases last spring, can be expected to remain cautious about spending if their sales don't pick up
that recent developments in Eastern Europe will expand markets for U.S.-made machine tools in that region.There is demand for state-of-the-art machine tools in the Soviet Union and in other Eastern European countries as those nations strive to improve the efficiency of their ailing factories as well as the quality of their goods
However, there's a continuing dispute between machine tool makers and the Defense Department over whether sophisticated U.S. machine tools would increase the Soviet Union's military might. "The Commerce Department says go, and the Defense Department says stop
Orders last month for metal-forming presses and other machinery to form metal with pressure surged to $110.1 million, a 78% rise from $61.7 million a year earlier and a 55% gain from $70.9 million in August.Today's presses are large and costly machines, and a few orders can produce a high total for one month that doesn't necessarily indicate a trend
Machine tool shipments last month were $281.2 million, a 24% rise from a year earlier and a 25% increase from August.Shipments have run well ahead of 1988 all year, as machine tool builders produce against relatively good backlogs
U.S. producers had a $2.15 billion backlog of unfilled orders at the end of September.That was up 2.8% from a year earlier, even though orders for the first nine months of 1989 were down 19% from the comparable 1988 period
In Bombay stock market circles, the buzzword is "mega." At least 40 companies are coming to the capital market to raise $6 billion, an amount never thought possible in India
When they talk mega-issues, they're truly talking mega.The capital market is booming
But the mega-issues are raising megaquestions about the rapidly evolving Indian capital market.One is whether there is enough money to fund the new issues without depressing stock trading
Moreover, in the relatively unregulated Indian stock markets, investors frequently don't know what they are getting when they subscribe to an issue.A prospectus in India doesn't always tell a potential investor much
A prospectus in India doesn't always tell a potential investor much.Some of the large amounts are being raised by small firms
Some analysts are concerned that the mega-issues, in such an unregulated environment, could lead to a mega-crash. "The rate of failures will be much more than the rate of successes in the mega-projects," says G.S. Patel, a former chairman of the giant, government-run mutual fund, the Unit Trust of India
The rate of failures will be much more than the rate of successes in the mega-projects.They're going to have mega-problems
The $6 billion that some 40 companies are looking to raise in the year ending March 31 compares with only $2.7 billion raised on the capital market in the previous fiscal year.In fiscal 1984, before Mr. Gandhi came to power, only $810 million was raised
And it isn't the only giant issue: together, the top four issues will raise $1.3 billion.Convertible debentures -- bonds that can later be converted into equity shares -- are the most popular instrument this year
When Mr. Gandhi came to power, he ushered in new rules for business.He said industry should build plants on the same scale as those outside India and benefit from economies of scale.If the output was too great for the domestic market, he said, companies should export
India's overregulated businessmen had to be persuaded, but they have started to think big.and they require more capital than the smaller industrial units built in the past
Some of the projects being funded by the new issues are the first fruits of Mr. Gandhi's policy, and they require more capital than the smaller industrial units built in the past.The industrial revolution has produced an explosion in the capital market, which is a far cheaper source of funds than government-controlled banks, where interest rates for prime borrowers are around 16%
The second factor spurring mega-issues is political.Mr. Gandhi has called general elections for November, and many businessmen fear that he and his Congress (I) Party will lose
Mr. Gandhi has called general elections for November, and many businessmen fear that he and his Congress (I) Party will lose.Some companies are raising money in anticipation of a government less predictable than Mr. Gandhi's, and possibly more restrictive
that some of the money raised in the current spate of issues will be used as campaign donations before the elections.but India's industrialists have a history of making under-the-table campaign donations
So far, the mega-issues are a hit with investors.Earlier this year, Tata Iron & Steel Co. 's offer of $355 million of convertible debentures was oversubscribed
Earlier this year, Tata Iron & Steel Co. 's offer of $355 million of convertible debentures was oversubscribed.Essar Gujarat Ltd., a marine construction company, had similar success with a slightly smaller issue

's offer of $355 million of convertible debentures was oversubscribed.Essar Gujarat Ltd., a marine construction company, had similar success with a slightly smaller issue.Larsen & Toubro started accepting applications for its giant issue earlier this month; bankers and analysts expect it to be oversubscribed
I don't think it will lead to any chaos in the secondary market only a sagging tendency.The "markets are headed for growth unheard of and unseen before
In the past, the government controlled the markets indirectly, through its tight grip on industry itself.Various ministries decided the products businessmen could produce and how much; and government-owned banks controlled the financing of projects and monitored whether companies came through on promised plans
But now, with large amounts being raised from investors, the government's dawdling on regulation and disclosure requirements has a more dangerous aspect.The Securities and Exchange Board of India was set up earlier this year, along the lines of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, but New Delhi hasn't pushed the legislation to make it operational
The Securities and Exchange Board of India was set up earlier this year, along the lines of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, but New Delhi hasn't pushed the legislation to make it operational.Mr. Dave, its head, acts cheery and patient, but he makes no bones about the need to get to work
Mega or non-mega, we feel the prospectus standards need to be considerably improved.Disclosures are very poor in India

Someone must monitor where the funds are deployed.There is no proper monitoring and screening of the use of these funds
There is no proper monitoring and screening of the use of these funds.They're trying to plug the various loopholes, but they're totally unprepared for this
Because of the large amounts of money being raised, the loose disclosure requirements and the casual monitoring of how the money is used, some analysts fear that there could be a few mega-crashes, which could hurt market confidence far more than the small bankruptcies that followed the boom of 1986.The government insists that such a possibility is low
The government insists that such a possibility is low.It says that despite loose regulation of the market itself, its longstanding regulation of industry will prevent such crashes

British government restrictions prevent any single shareholder from going beyond 15% before the end of 1990 without government permission.The British government, which owned Jaguar until 1984, still holds a controlling "golden share" in the company
With the golden share as protection, Jaguar officials have rebuffed Ford's overtures, and moved instead to forge an alliance with GM. Jaguar officials have indicated they are close to wrapping up a friendly alliance with GM that would preserve Jaguar's independence, but no deal has been announced
it's willing to bid for all of Jaguar, despite the objections of Jaguar chairman Sir John Egan.that Ford may try to force the issue by calling for a special shareholder's meeting and urging that the government and Jaguar holders remove the barriers to a full bidding contest before December 1990
Ford officials will seek a meeting this week with Sir John to outline their proposal for a full bid.Any discussions with Ford could postpone the Jaguar-GM deal, headed for completion within the next two weeks
Any discussions with Ford could postpone the Jaguar-GM deal, headed for completion within the next two weeks.The GM agreement is expected to retain Jaguar's independence by involving an eventual 30% stake for the U.S. auto giant as well as joint manufacturing and marketing ventures
Jaguar and GM hope to win Jaguar shareholders approval for the accord partly by structuring it in a way that wouldn't preclude a full Ford bid once the golden share expires.

Of course that wasn't the actual conversation the late anti-war activist, protest leader and founder of the Yippies ever had with his brother.It's a script pieced together from interviews by CBS News for a re-enactment, a dramatic rendering by an actor of Mr. Hoffman's ultimately unsuccessful struggle with depression
The segment is soon to be broadcast on the CBS News series "Saturday Night With Connie Chung," thus further blurring the distinction between fiction and reality in TV news.It is the New Journalism come to television
who isn't new to the character.He was Mr. Hoffman in a 1979 Los Angeles production of a play called "The Chicago Conspiracy Trial
Television news, of course, has always been part show-biz.Broadcasters have a healthy appreciation of the role entertainment values play in captivating an audience
Since its premiere Sept. 16, the show on which Ms. Chung appears has used an actor to portray the Rev. Vernon Johns, a civil-rights leader, and one to play a teenage drug dealer.It has depicted the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie

Benjamin Weir and Father Lawrence Jenco
ABC News has similarly branched out into entertainment gimmickry. "Prime Time Live," a new show this season featuring Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer, has a studio audience that applauds and that one night (to the embarrassment of the network) waved at the camera like the crowd on "Let's Make a Deal

The marriage of news and theater, if not exactly inevitable, has been consummated nonetheless.News programs, particularly if they score well in the ratings, appeal to the networks' cost-conscious corporate parents because they are so much less expensive to produce than an entertainment show is -- somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 for a one-hour program
News programs, particularly if they score well in the ratings, appeal to the networks' cost-conscious corporate parents because they are so much less expensive to produce than an entertainment show is -- somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 for a one-hour program.Entertainment shows tend to cost twice that
Re-enactments have been used successfully for several seasons on such syndicated "tabloid TV" shows as "A Current Affair.That show, whose host is Ms. Chung's husband, Maury Povich, has a particular penchant for grisly murders and stories having to do with sex -- the Robert Chambers murder case, the Rob Lowe tapes, what have you
Nowhere have eyes been opened wider than at CBS News.At 555 W. 57th St. in Manhattan, one floor below the offices of "60 Minutes," the most successful prime-time news program ever, actors wait in the reception area to audition for "Saturday Night With Connie Chung
CBS News sends scripts to agents, who pass them along to clients.The network deals a lot with unknowns, including Scott Wentworth, who portrayed Mr. Anderson, and Bill Alton as Father Jenco, but the network has some big names to contend with, too

CBS News, which as recently as two years ago fired hundreds of its employees in budget cutbacks, now hires featured actors beginning at $2,700 a week.That isn't much compared with what Bill Cosby makes, or even Connie Chung for that matter
CBS News is also re-enacting the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Middletown, Pa., with something less than a cast of thousands.It is combing the town of 10,000 for about 200 extras

No way.I think re-enactments stink
Though a re-enactment may have the flavor, Hollywood on the Hudson it isn't.Some producers seem tentative about the technique, squeamish even
Re-creating events has, in general, upset news traditionalists, including former CBS News President Richard S. Salant and former NBC News President Reuven Frank, former CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite and the new dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, Joan Konner.Says she: "Once you add dramatizations, it's no longer news, it's drama, and that has no place on a network news broadcast

Criticism of the Abbie Hoffman segment is particularly scathing among people who knew and loved the man.That includes his companion of 15 years, Johanna Lawrenson, as well as his former wife, Anita
This is dangerous and misrepresents Abbie's life.It's a sensational piece about someone who is not here to defend himself
that dramatization "makes the truth flexible.It takes one person's account and gives it authenticity
The executive producer of "Saturday Night With Connie Chung," Andrew Lack, declines to discuss re-creactions as a practice or his show, in particular. "I don't talk about my work
but says CBS News is "aware" of the concerns of Ms. Lawrenson and Mr. Hoffman's former wife.Neither woman was invited by CBS News to participate in a round-table discussion about Mr. Hoffman that is to follow the re-enactment
he was concerned at first that the script would "misrepresent an astute political mind, one that I admired," but that his concerns were allayed.The producers did a good job of depicting someone "who had done so much, but who was also a manic-depressive

Now, the giant marketing company, which holds 25% of Japan's 4.4 trillion yen ($30.96 billion) advertising industry, is considering the acquisition of an advertising network in the U.S. or Europe.What is driving Dentsu's international expansion largely is the need to keep up with its Japanese clients as they grow in the U.S. and Europe
What is driving Dentsu's international expansion largely is the need to keep up with its Japanese clients as they grow in the U.S. and Europe. "If we don't do something . . . we won't be able to catch up with demand
If we don't do something . . . we won't be able to catch up with demand.Our president said acquisition is an effective method
Last year, Dentsu's foreign business accounted for less than 10% of total billings, but the company is aiming at 20% in the near future.So far, it appears cautious about taking the big step
Though Dentsu says it has no concrete acquisition plans or deadlines, it is laying the groundwork for international growth.It is setting up a special team in charge of international markets and training workers to do business abroad
For the year ended March 31, Dentsu sales rose 19% to $8.9 billion from $7.5 billion, and net income jumped 59% to $102 million from $64 million.Dentsu's billings last year were larger than those of Young & Rubicam, the world's second-largest ad agency, according to a survey by the publication Advertising Age
But success overseas in unfamiliar markets could be trickier than for other industries such as manufacturers.On its own, Dentsu's muscle in Japan may count for little in major foreign markets when seeking non-Japanese clients
But Japanese agencies are cautious about expanding abroad because client relationships are different.Japanese agencies do business with rival clients in the same industry
The show, one of five new NBC series, is the second casualty of the three networks so far this fall.Last week CBS Inc. canceled "The People Next Door
NBC's comedy had aired Wednesdays at 9:30 p.m. and in five outings had drawn an average of only 13.2% of homes, lagging behind the Jamie Lee Curtis comedy "Anything But Love" on ABC and CBS's one-hour drama "Jake and the Fatman."

Despite the inevitable comparison with Compaq, however, Texas Instruments' new notebook won't be a direct competitor.While Compaq sells its machines to businesses through computer retailers, Texas Instruments will be selling most of its machines to the industrial market and to value-added resellers and original-equipment manufacturers
The introductions also mark Texas Instruments' plunge back into a technology it has all but ignored for the past several years.Although the Dallas-based computer giant introduced the first portable data terminal in 1971 -- a 38-pound monster -- and the world's first microprocessor-based portable in 1976, the only portable machines it has introduced since the first part of the decade have been "dumb" terminals with limited on-board processing ability

Now that is about to change, as Texas Instruments begins marketing two 14-pound laptop PCs with 20 megabyte and 40 megabyte hard drives.The laptops are not revolutionary and, indeed, are tardy in a market first opened by GRiD Systems Corp., now a unit of Tandy Corp., almost two years ago
But the notebook, with the more advanced microprocessor and hard disk, is more innovative.Weighing 6.7 pounds with battery, the notebook measures 8.2 by 11.7 inches, has a 20-megabyte hard disk drive and boasts a backlit screen that is 22% larger than Compaq's
Weighing 6.7 pounds with battery, the notebook measures 8.2 by 11.7 inches, has a 20-megabyte hard disk drive and boasts a backlit screen that is 22% larger than Compaq's.Its keyboard, according to industry consultants, is better than Compaq's, but its battery life of two to three hours is shorter

Under terms of the stock, the Yukon ESOP can demand that the stock be redeemed for $4,090,000 on Nov. 30, but NBI said it is legally prohibited from making the redemption.Failure to pay the dividend allows Yukon to convert all or some of its shares into NBI common after Nov. 30, at a conversion price based on NBI's closing stock price

Insurers typically retain a small percentage of the risks they underwrite and pass on the rest of the losses.Insurers buy this insurance protection for themselves by giving up a portion of the premiums they collect on a policy to another firm -- a reinsurance company, which, in turn, accepts a portion of any losses resulting from this policy
Insurers buy this insurance protection for themselves by giving up a portion of the premiums they collect on a policy to another firm -- a reinsurance company, which, in turn, accepts a portion of any losses resulting from this policy.Insurers, such as Cigna Corp., Transamerica Corp, and Aetna Life & Casualty Co., buy reinsurance from other U.S.-based companies and Lloyd's of London for one catastrophe at a time
However, companies with few catastrophe losses this year and already big buyers of reinsurance are likely to see their rates remain flat, or perhaps even decline slightly.Many companies will be negotiating their 1990 reinsurance contracts in the next few weeks
But some large insurers, such as State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., don't purchase reinsurance, but fund their own program.A few years ago, State Farm, the nation's largest home insurer, stopped buying reinsurance because no one carrier could provide all the coverage that it needed and the company found it cheaper to self-reinsure

Several longtime observers of the commodities industry think the fortunes of the Merc over the next decade will be determined to a large extent by how well its new natural gas futures contract does and how successful its new president is in raising the level of compliance by floor traders with exchange and Commodity Futures Trading Commission rules.If the exchange falters in these moves, they say, it might once again fall behind its chief New York competitor, the Commodity Exchange
If the exchange falters in these moves, they say, it might once again fall behind its chief New York competitor, the Commodity Exchange.On Friday, the Merc's board announced that it had approved Sabine Pipe Line Co. 's Henry Hub in Erath, La., as the delivery site for its long-awaited natural gas futures contract
It also said that it would start trading the contract as soon as the CFTC approved it.The CFTC has 90 days to respond to such applications
The CFTC has 90 days to respond to such applications.The Merc first started working on developing this contract in 1984
Only three weeks earlier, the Merc had turned to one of its own executives, 40-year-old R. Patrick Thompson, to replace Rosemary T. McFadden as president.Mr. Thompson is believed to have a mandate from the board of directors to help improve the Merc's tarnished reputation as an exchange whose floor traders don't follow the rules very well
Ms. McFadden had been forced out in July in a bitter power struggle with Z. Lou Guttman, chairman and a longtime floor trader on the exchange.that he was looking for a president who would be "responsive to the needs of the membership and the board
By contrast, the Comex in July imported a highly regarded outsider, Arnold F. Staloff, as its president.Mr. Staloff, 44, was a senior officer of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and is considered a specialist in new financial products
Mr. Thompson isn't bereft of experience with new products, however.For the past two years he and the exchange's research department have been working on the new natural gas contract, seeking a good delivery site and studying the natural gas market
Our members are eager to begin trading this contract, so we expect no difficulty in attracting locals to the natural gas pit," he said.The educational effort of teaching companies in the natural gas industry how to use the futures to hedge would have to continue for another a year or two
The educational effort of teaching companies in the natural gas industry how to use the futures to hedge would have to continue for another a year or two, he added.The Merc's extremely successful contracts in crude oil, gasoline and heating oil have made it the largest futures exchange in New York, and third behind the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange

So far they have issued scores of subpoenas, some of which went to members of the New York Merc.Mr. Thompson will have to face some of the consequences of those subpoenas
In a recent General Accounting Office study, the Merc was found to have been the most lax in enforcing exchange rules.It levied the smallest number of suspensions of traders and fines of the four largest commodity exchanges studied over the past five years
that its compliance director, Kevin P. Conway, who then was responsible for policing the exchange's busy oil and metal pits, "was engaged in other personal business activities on Exchange time," including out-of-state trips, according to a New York Merc report prepared last year.Mr. Conway is no longer at the exchange
We had a management breakdown in 1987 in terms of compliance.We recognized the problem and took care of it
We recognized the problem and took care of it." He says that even if the natural gas contract boosts volume at the exchange strongly, the 1990 business plan calls for having adequate compliance people to ensure that exchange rules are being followed

One of those areas is the development of a hand-held electronic device that would permit floor traders to enter trades as they make them.the creation of a system to record trade data so that an independent, verifiable audit trail can be established to prevent customer fraud
The GAO has recommended the creation of a system to record trade data so that an independent, verifiable audit trail can be established to prevent customer fraud.The Merc is now cooperating with the Comex in developing such a device to provide such an audit trail
Another major electronics problem faces Mr. Thompson -- the creation of a 24-hour trading system that can be used outside normal trading hours.In January, the New York Merc signed a letter of intent with the Chicago Merc as a preliminary step to joining their electronic system called Globex
his exchange isn't waiting for the results of the Chicago exchanges' cooperation.It recently began a pilot program to test an electronic trading system called ATS/2, the automated trading system created by the International Commodities Clearing House
there is good technical support between $1.10 and $1.12 a pound for December copper, which ended Friday at $1.1580 a pound, up 1.6 cents.He views the $1.10 to $1.12 range as a buying opportunity and considers the market oversold

However, to resume the bull trend, according to Mr. O'Neill, copper would have to close over $1.19.He said there are two reports this week that might affect prices: the purchasing managers report on Wednesday and the unemployment report on Friday
Friday's strong price gains confirmed a turnaround in the precious metals markets, according to PaineWebber's Mr. Frawley. "Most traders will be looking to buy {on} pullbacks
the moves in the metals last week were most influenced by the uncertainty in the equity and other financial markets.According to Mr. Frawley, floor traders say there is good support for December gold in the $374 to $375 per ounce area, around $5.20 an ounce for December silver and in the $485 to $490 an ounce range for January platinum
the price action for all of last week is the best he has seen on a weekly basis in more than a year.He said last week's activity in gold could portend a move to $390 an ounce for the December contract
traders should be on the lookout for how metals producers react to this rally. "I expect to see some selling, but will they kill this one as they have every rally in the recent past" by selling and locking in prices for their production

In recent weeks, warm and dry weather has sped the Midwest harvest and that is permitting farmers to rebuild the stockpiles that were cut by the 1988 drought.If the weather allowed farmers to work in their fields over the weekend, many Midwest grain elevators will probably sell futures contracts today at the Chicago Board of Trade in order to hedge their weekend purchases from farmers

For three years, a healthy economy and the export-boosting effects of a weak dollar propelled sales and earnings of the big paper companies to record levels.As the good times rolled they more than doubled their prices for pulp, a raw material used in all sorts of paper, to $830 a metric ton this past spring from $380 a ton at the start of 1986
But now the companies are getting into trouble because they undertook a record expansion program while they were raising prices sharply.Third-quarter profits fell at several companies

At this week's New York City bond sale, traders expect yields on the 20-year New York bonds to nearly match the 7.9% yield on 30-year Treasury bonds.For an investor in the 28% federal tax bracket, 7.9% tax-free is the same as 10.38% on a taxable investment

Fundamental factors are at work as well.Muni bond holders are worried about the impact of a slowing economy on tax revenue, at a time when many state and local governments already face budget deficits and huge spending needs
Muni bond holders are worried about the impact of a slowing economy on tax revenue, at a time when many state and local governments already face budget deficits and huge spending needs.The recent natural disasters, and the need of many other cities to rebuild crumbling infrastructure, suggests that supply of new issues will continue to rise sharply -- even as demand tapers off
Mutual funds, for example, are said to be selling existing municipal bonds to raise cash to buy new issues.Because municipal bonds yields have risen at a time when interest rates generally have fallen, some portfolio managers are assuming that bonds bought now will appreciate in value as the municipal bond market rebounds
Ms. Avedisian believes that the mutual funds are selling muni bonds that have a negative convexity -- those that have appreciated in price slowly relative to the decline in interest rates.Such bonds, she says, are those that are nearing their call date

Abby Joseph Cohen, a market strategist at Drexel Burnham Lambert, isn't nearly so sanguine about the market's chances of surging to new highs anytime soon.Her view is that stock prices have three major props: merger and buy-out proposals, earnings and the economic outlook.At current levels of economic activity and earnings, stocks are fairly valued, she says.But any chance for prices to surge above fair value lies in the speculation that accompanies a vigorous merger and buy-out business, and UAL has obviously put a damper on that. "Stocks aren't cheap anymore, there have been some judicial and legislative changes in the merger area and all of this changes the arithmetic of deals," she says. "I'm not saying they've stopped altogether, but future deals are going to be structured differently and bids probably won't be as high

The ice samples are an important piece of evidence supporting theories that the Earth has warmed considerably in recent times, largely because of pollutants in the air, and will warm far more in the century ahead.A substantial warming would melt some of the Earth's polar ice caps, raising the level of the oceans and causing widespread flooding of heavily populated coastal areas
To compare temperatures over the past 10,000 years, researchers analyzed the changes in concentrations of two forms of oxygen.These measurements can indicate temperature changes
Analysis of ice from the Dunde ice cap, a glacial plateau in Tibet 17,000 feet above sea level, show that average temperatures were higher in 1937-87 than in any other 50-year period since before the last Ice Age.Some climate models project that interior regions of Asia would be among the first to heat up in a global warming because they are far from oceans, which moderate temperature changes
But the ice-core samples aren't definitive proof that the so-called greenhouse effect will lead to further substantial global heating, Mr. Thompson acknowledged.According to greenhouse theories, increased carbon dioxide emissions, largely caused by burning of fossil fuels, will cause the Earth to warm up because carbon dioxide prevents heat from escaping into space
Instead, the Dunde ice-core record shows increasing temperatures from 1900 through the early 1950s, decreasing temperatures from the late 1950s through the mid-1970s, then higher temperatures again through last year.Other temperature data show similar unexplained swings

The result is that instead of the Pentagon's proposed split of 60-40 between domestic and foreign bases, the reduced funding is distributed by a ratio of approximately 70-30.The extra margin for bases in the U.S. enhances the power of the appropriations committees

Tennessee and North Carolina, home states of the two Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate military construction subcommittees, receive $243.2 million, or 25% above the Pentagon's request.Though spending for Iowa and Oregon was far less, their increases above Pentagon requests -- 640% and 430%, respectively -- were much greater because of the influence of Republicans at critical junctures
The swift passage of the bill, which cleared the Senate and House on simple voice votes last week, contrasts with the problems still facing a more cumbersome $66.8 billion measure funding housing, environmental, space and veterans programs.By an 84-6 margin, the Senate approved the bulk of the spending Friday, but the bill was then sent back to the House to resolve the question of how to address budget limits on credit allocations for the Federal Housing Administration
but the underlying bill is already under attack for excesses elsewhere.Appropriations committees have used an assortment of devices to disguise as much as $1 billion in spending
For example, a House-Senate conference ostensibly increased the National Aeronautics and Space Administration budget for construction of facilities to nearly $592 million, or more than $200 million above what either chamber had previously approved.Part of the increase would provide $90 million toward ensuring construction of a costly solid rocket-motor facility in Mr. Whitten's Mississippi

Most of the land in that and other parts of the Delta are now owned by second, third or fourth generations of the same families.These are the families who used -- and sometime abused -- their sharecroppers, people who had no encouragement and little access to an education or training for a better life
These are the families who used -- and sometime abused -- their sharecroppers, people who had no encouragement and little access to an education or training for a better life.Following World War II, when one family with mechanized equipment could farm crops formerly requiring 20 families, the surplus people were dumped into the mainstream of society with no Social Security, no skills in the workplace, no hope for their future except welfare
Because the cycle of poverty along the lower Mississippi goes back so many generations, breaking this cycle will be next to impossible.Sadly, the cycle appears not as waves but as a downward spiral
Yet the evidence that we have not hit bottom is found in the fact that we are not yet helping ourselves.The people of the Delta are waiting for that big factory to open, river traffic to increase, government spending to fund job-training programs or public schools to educate apathetic students
Because we refuse to face the tough answers, the questions continue as fodder for the commissions and committees, for the media and politicians.Coffee-shop chatter does not lend itself to solving the problems of racism, teen pregnancy or lack of parental support or guidance
Does the Delta deserve government help in attracting industry when the majority of residents, black and white, do not realize racism alienates potential employers?Should we focus on the region's infant-mortality rate when the vocal right-wingers and the school boards, mayors and legislators prohibit schools from teaching the two ways (abstinence or contraceptives) of decreasing teen pregnancy
Should we focus on the region's infant-mortality rate when the vocal right-wingers and the school boards, mayors and legislators prohibit schools from teaching the two ways (abstinence or contraceptives) of decreasing teen pregnancy?Delta problems are difficult, not impossible, to solve -- I am just not convinced that we are ready to solve them yet
I would like to issue a challenge to corporate America.The next time expansion plans are mentioned at the old company and somebody says, "Aw heck, guys, nobody can do it like Japan or South Korea," I wish you would butt in and say, "Hold it, fellas, why don't we compare prices and use our own little Third World country
The next time expansion plans are mentioned at the old company and somebody says, "Aw heck, guys, nobody can do it like Japan or South Korea," I wish you would butt in and say, "Hold it, fellas, why don't we compare prices and use our own little Third World country.We would even save on freight
Your story is an insult to the citizens of the Mississippi Delta.Many of the problems you presented exist in every part of this country
Many of the problems you presented exist in every part of this country.Poverty is only two blocks from President Bush's residence
Poverty is only two blocks from President Bush's residence.For years, we tried to ignore the problem of poverty, and now that it has gotten out of hand it's a new crusade for the media and our Democratic Congress
Nobody should have to live in such poor conditions as in "Sugar Ditch," but when you travel to Washington, Boston, Chicago or New York, the same problems exist.The only difference is, in those cities the poor are housed in high-rise-project apartments each consisting of one room, with rusty pipes called plumbing, rodents and cockroaches everywhere and nonworking elevators -- and with the building patrolled by gangs and drug dealers
that it was going to reduce employment in production operations of the group by 8%, or 400 people.The exploration side of the unit has recently undergone a similar overhaul, during which it also lost as many as 400 employees
The exploration side of the unit has recently undergone a similar overhaul, during which it also lost as many as 400 employees, a company spokesman said in response to questions.Mobil Exploration & Producing U.S. Inc., the group involved, currently has a work force of somewhat less than 5,000
Mobil alluded to the work-force cuts last week when it took a $40 million charge as part of its third-quarter earnings and attributed it to a restructuring.that it is unlikely any additional charges related to this move will be taken in future quarters
On Wednesday, Mobil will begin offering separation packages and voluntary retirement in its U.S. production operation.Mobil officials said they have been studying ways of streamlining these operations since early this year
During the coming months, layers of management will be peeled away and regional offices will become more autonomous.For greater efficiency, employees at those locations will be reorganized into teams responsible for managing the properties under their jurisdiction
For greater efficiency, employees at those locations will be reorganized into teams responsible for managing the properties under their jurisdiction.The main feature of the new organization is that each local manager will have both the authority and accountability for profitable and technically sound operations
But on the West Coast, where profitable oil production is more likely than in the midcontinent region, the Bakersfield, Calif., office staff of 130 will grow by 175 to 305.The reorganization will "focus on the value and potential of assets," Mr. Spruell said
investors willing to look could find double-digit yields at some banks and thrifts.Now, the nationwide average yield on a six-month CD is just under 8%, and 8.5% is about the best around
But investors looking for alternatives aren't finding it easy.Yields on most fixed-income securities are lower than several months ago
There are, however, some alternatives that income-oriented investors should consider.Short-term municipal bonds, bond funds and tax-deferred annuities are some of the choices they mention -- and not just as a way to get a higher return
A mix of CDs and other holdings may make the most sense. "People should remember their money isn't all or nothing -- they don't need to be shopping for the one interest-rate-type investment and putting all their money in it
Investors with a heavy tax load should take out their calculators.Yields on municipal bonds can be higher than after-tax yields on CDs for maturities of perhaps one to five years
For an investor paying tax at a 33% rate, a seemingly puny 6% yield on a one-year muni is equivalent to a taxable 9%.Rates approach 6.5% on five-year municipals
Some of the more cautious CD holders might like "pre-refunded" municipals.These securities get top credit ratings
Consider a "laddered" bond portfolio, with issues maturing in, say, 1992, 1993 and 1994.The idea is to have money rolling over each year at prevailing interest rates
Bond mutual funds offer diversification and are easy to buy and sell.That makes them a reasonable option for investors who will accept some risk of price fluctuation in order to make a bet that interest rates will decline over the next year or so
But they will have disappointing returns or even losses if interest rates rise instead.Bond resale prices, and thus fund share prices, move in the opposite direction from rates
Bond resale prices, and thus fund share prices, move in the opposite direction from rates.The price movements get bigger as the maturity of the securities lengthens
Consider, for instance, two bond funds from Vanguard Group of Investment Cos. that were both yielding 8.6% on a recent day.The Short Term Bond Fund, with an average maturity of 2 1/2 years, would deliver a total return for one year of about 10.6% if rates drop one percentage point and a one-year return of about 6.6% if rates rise by the same amount
You get equity-like returns" from bonds if you guess right on rates.If interest rates don't change, bond fund investors' returns will be about equal to the funds' current yields
These insurance company contracts feature some of the same tax benefits and restrictions as non-deductible individual retirement accounts: Investment gains are compounded without tax consequences until money is withdrawn, but a 10% penalty tax is imposed on withdrawals made before age 59 1/2.Aimed specifically at CD holders are so-called CD-type annuities, or certificates of annuity
Aimed specifically at CD holders are so-called CD-type annuities, or certificates of annuity.An interest rate is guaranteed for between one and seven years, after which holders get 30 days to choose another guarantee period or to switch to another insurer's contract without the surrender charges that are common to annuities
That's right, money market mutual funds.The conventional wisdom is to go into money funds when rates are rising and shift out at times such as the present, when rates seem headed down
to go into money funds when rates are rising and shift out at times such as the present, when rates seem headed down.With average maturities of a month or so, money funds offer fixed share prices and floating returns that track market interest rates, with a slight lag
Mr. Witman likes the Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound yield just under 9.5%.A new fund, its operating expenses are being temporarily subsidized by the sponsor
Try combining a money fund and an intermediate-term bond fund as a low-risk bet on falling rates.If rates unexpectedly rise, the increasing return on the money fund will partly offset the lower-than-expected return from the bond fund
The United Kingdom reports came from Dr. Patrick Toseland, head of clinical chemistry at Guy's Hospital in London.In a telephone interview Friday, Dr. Toseland said the number of sudden, unexplained deaths of diabetics he had seen this year was 17 compared with just two in 1985
the number of sudden, unexplained deaths of diabetics he had seen this year was 17 compared with just two in 1985.At least six of the deaths occurred among relatively young diabetics who had switched from animal to human insulin within the past year
The usual warning signs of hypoglycemia include sweating, anxiety and cramps.With proper warning, diabetics can easily raise their blood sugar to safe levels by eating sugar or sugary food
With proper warning, diabetics can easily raise their blood sugar to safe levels by eating sugar or sugary food. "The anecdotal data certainly shows that some of the people were not aware of the rapid onset of hypoglycemia
officials conducting the study hadn't been looking for signs of problems related to hypoglycemia unawareness. "We are now monitoring for it much more closely
We do know there are slight differences in the way human and animal insulins drive down blood sugar.The human-based drug starts the blood sugar dropping sooner and drives it down faster
Reports of Dr. Toseland's findings in the British press have triggered widespread concern among diabetics there.Both the British Diabetic Association and the Committee on Safety in Medicines -- Britain's equivalent of the U.S. FDA -- recently issued statements noting the lack of hard scientific evidence to support Dr. Toseland's findings
Eli Lilly & Co., the Indianapolis-based drug manufacturer, dominates the U.S. human insulin market with its product known as Humulin.Lilly is building plants to make the insulin in Indianapolis and Fagershein, France
Lilly is building plants to make the insulin in Indianapolis and Fagershein, France.In its latest annual report, Lilly said Humulin sales have shown "excellent growth
they had seen reports of hypoglycemic unawareness among some patients making the shift from animal to human insulin, but didn't know if the problem had caused any deaths.the company's clinical trials of both its animal and human-based insulins indicated no difference in the level of hypoglycemia between users of either product
most of the British diabetics who died had been taking a human-based insulin made by Novo/Nordisk, a Danish manufacturer.None of the diabetics were using Lilly's insulin
Defense intellectuals have complained for years that the Pentagon cannot determine priorities because it has no strategy.Last April, the new defense secretary, Richard Cheney, acknowledged that, "given an ideal world, we'd have a nice, neat, orderly process
that, "given an ideal world, we'd have a nice, neat, orderly process.We'd do the strategy and then we'd come around and do the budget
We'd do the strategy and then we'd come around and do the budget.This city doesn't work that way
This city doesn't work that way." With a five-year defense plan costing more than $1.6 trillion, it's about time we put together a defense strategy that works in Washington
This won't happen until strategists come down from their ivory tower and learn to work in the real world of limited budgets and uncertain futures.As it is, we identify national goals and the threats to these goals, we shape a strategy to counter these threats, we determine the forces needed to execute the strategy, before finally forging the budgets needed to build and maintain the forces
As it is, we identify national goals and the threats to these goals, we shape a strategy to counter these threats, we determine the forces needed to execute the strategy, before finally forging the budgets needed to build and maintain the forces.These procedures consume millions of man-hours of labor and produce tons of paper, and each year, their end product -- the Five Year Defense Plan -- promptly melts away
The graph on the left shows how this happens.Compare the past eight five-year plans with actual appropriations
Compare the past eight five-year plans with actual appropriations.The Pentagon's strategists produce budgets that simply cannot be executed because they assume a defense strategy depends only on goals and threats
Strategy, however, is about possibilities, not hopes and dreams.By ignoring costs, U.S. strategists abdicate their responsibility for hard decisions
By ignoring costs, U.S. strategists abdicate their responsibility for hard decisions.That puts the real strategic decisions in the hands of others: bean counters, budgeteers, and pork-barrelers
That puts the real strategic decisions in the hands of others: bean counters, budgeteers, and pork-barrelers.These people have different agendas
Reform starts in the Pentagon.Strategists should consider the impact of budget uncertainties at the beginning of the planning process
Strategists should consider the impact of budget uncertainties at the beginning of the planning process.They ought to examine how a range of optimistic to pessimistic budget scenarios would change the defense program
They would also identify the best way to add programs, should the budget come in at higher levels.This kind of contingency analysis is common in war planning and business planning
This kind of contingency analysis is common in war planning and business planning.There is no reason that it can not be done for defense planning
Two steps are necessary to translate this idea into action.Step 1 cleans up our books
Step 1 cleans up our books.Our five-year plan contains three accounting devices -- negative money, an above guidance management reserve and optimistic inflation estimates -- which understate the spending the Pentagon has committed itself to by almost $100 billion
Negative money was invented in 1988 to make the 1990-94 Five Year Defense Plan conform to the numbers in President Reagan's final budget submission to Congress.That plan exceeded the numbers contained in his budget message by $45 billion
That plan exceeded the numbers contained in his budget message by $45 billion.To make the books balance, as is required by law, somebody invented a new budget line item that simply subtracted $45 billion
To make the books balance, as is required by law, somebody invented a new budget line item that simply subtracted $45 billion.It is known in the Pentagon as the "negative wedge
The 1990 plan also assumes inflation will decline to 1.7% by 1994.Most forecasters, including those in the Congressional Budget Office, assume inflation will be in excess of 4% in each of those five years
Most forecasters, including those in the Congressional Budget Office, assume inflation will be in excess of 4% in each of those five years.At that rate, the defense plan is underfunded by $48 billion
Step 2 examines how four progressively lower budget scenarios would change the baseline and how these changes would affect our national security.The graph on the right (which assumes a 4% rate of inflation), places these scenarios in the context of recent appropriations
The graph on the right (which assumes a 4% rate of inflation), places these scenarios in the context of recent appropriations.Note how the baseline program assumes a sharp increase in future appropriations
Note how the baseline program assumes a sharp increase in future appropriations.Step 2 will answer the question: What happens if these increases do not materialize
Scenario 1, known as the "Constant Dollar Freeze," reimburses the Pentagon for inflation only -- it slopes upward at 4% per year.and it reduces the baseline by $106 billion between 1990 and 1994
Scenario 3, the "Current Dollar Freeze," has been the approximate position of the House of Representatives for about four years.It freezes the budget at its current level, and forces the Pentagon to eat the effects of inflation until 1994
It freezes the budget at its current level, and forces the Pentagon to eat the effects of inflation until 1994.This reduces the baseline by $229 billion
Scenario 2 extends the recent compromises between the House and the Senate; it splits the difference between Scenarios 1 and 3, by increasing the budget at 2% per year.It reduces the baseline by $169 billion
Finally, Scenario 4 reduces the budget by 2% per year for the next five years -- a total reduction of $287 billion.This can be thought of as a pessimistic prediction, perhaps driven by the sequestering effects of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law or possibly a relaxation of tensions with the Soviet Union
The strategic planners in the Joint Chiefs of Staff would construct the most effective defense program for each scenario, maximizing strengths and minimizing weaknesses.They would conclude their efforts by producing a comprehensive net assessment for each plan -- including the assumptions made, an analysis of its deficiencies and limitations, the impact on national security, and the best strategy for working around these limitations
If, for example, they choose to keep the B-2 Stealth bomber, they would have to sacrifice more and more other programs -- such as carrier battlegroups or army divisions -- as they moved toward lower budget levels.These trade-offs would evolve priorities by revealing when the cost of the B-2 became prohibitive
Anyway, ZBB's procedures were so cumbersome that everyone involved was crushed under a burden of marginalia.A strategic review is fundamentally different
A strategic review is fundamentally different.It would be run by the joint chiefs under simple directions: Produce the best possible force for each budget scenario and provide the Secretary of Defense with a comprehensive net assessment of how that force could be used to achieve U.S. goals
It might be feared that even thinking about lower budgets will hurt national security because the door will be opened to opportunistic budget cutting by an irresponsible Congress.This argument plays well in the atmosphere of gaming and mistrust permeating the Pentagon and Congress, and unfortunately, there is some truth to it
But in the end, it must be rejected for logical as well as moral reasons.To say that the Pentagon should act irresponsibly because acting responsibly will provoke Congress into acting irresponsibly leads to the conclusion that the Pentagon should deliberately exaggerate its needs in the national interest
it is the art of the possible in a world where constraints force us to choose between unpleasant or imperfect alternatives.If we want meaningful priorities, we must understand the trade-offs they imply before we make commitments

While Wall Street's tough times and lower U.S. interest rates continue to undermine the dollar, weakness in the pound and the yen is expected to offset those factors. "By default," the dollar probably will be able to hold up pretty well in coming days
By default," the dollar probably will be able to hold up pretty well in coming days.We're close to the bottom" of the near-term ranges
In late Friday afternoon New York trading, the dollar was at 1.8300 marks and 141.65 yen, off from late Thursday's 1.8400 marks and 142.10 yen.The pound strengthened to $1.5795 from $1.5765
The dollar began Friday on a firm note, gaining against all major currencies in Tokyo dealings and early European trading despite reports that the Bank of Japan was seen unloading dollars around 142.70 yen.The rise came as traders continued to dump the pound after the sudden resignation Thursday of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
With the stock market wobbly and dollar buyers discouraged by signs of U.S. economic weakness and the recent decline in U.S. interest rates that has diminished the attractiveness of dollar-denominated investments, traders say the dollar is still in a precarious position. "They'll be looking at levels to sell the dollar
Predictions for limited dollar losses are based largely on the pound's weak state after Mr. Lawson's resignation and the yen's inability to strengthen substantially when there are dollar retreats.With the pound and the yen lagging behind other major currencies, "you don't have a confirmation" that a sharp dollar downturn is in the works
While the pound has attempted to stabilize, currency analysts say it is in critical condition.Sterling plunged about four cents Thursday and hit the week's low of $1.5765 when Mr. Lawson resigned from his six-year post because of a policy squabble with other cabinet members
Although the Bank of England's tight monetary policy has fueled worries that Britain's slowing economy is headed for a recession, it is widely believed that Mr. Lawson's willingness to prop up the pound with interest-rate increases helped stem pound selling in recent weeks.If there are any signs that Mr. Major will be less inclined to use interest-rate boosts to rescue the pound from another plunge, that currency is expected to fall sharply
The pound likely will fall in coming days and may trade as low as 2.60 marks within the next year.The pound was at 2.8896 marks late Friday, off sharply from 2.9511 in New York trading a week earlier
But such an increase could be viewed by the market as "too little too late." The Bank of England indicated its desire to leave its monetary policy unchanged Friday by declining to raise the official 15% discount-borrowing rate that it charges discount houses
The dollar has a "natural base of support" around 140 yen because the Japanese currency hasn't been purchased heavily in recent weeks.The yen's softness apparently stems from Japanese investors' interest in buying dollars against the yen to purchase U.S. bond issues and persistent worries about this year's upheaval in the Japanese government
On New York's Commodity Exchange Friday, gold for current delivery jumped $5.80, to $378.30 an ounce, the highest settlement since July 12.Estimated volume was a heavy seven million ounces
We are deeply disturbed that a recent editorial stated that the "Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989" was "crafted primarily by Democratic Senators Kennedy and Harkin" with a premise "based on the presumption that most Americans are hostile to the disabled. . . ." Perhaps even more offensive is the statement, "It is surprising that George Bush and the White House inner circle would ally themselves with this crabby philosophy
This legislation was not drafted by a handful of Democratic "do-gooders." Quite the contrary -- it results from years of work by members of the National Council on the Handicapped, all appointed by President Reagan

The opposite is true: It's the product of many meetings with administration officials, Senate staffers, advocates, and business and transportation officials.Many congressmen are citing the compromise on the "Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989" as a model for bipartisan deliberations
Most National Council members are themselves disabled or are parents of children with disabilities.We know firsthand the discrimination addressed by the act: to be told there's no place for your child in school; to spend lonely hours at home because there is no transportation for someone in a wheelchair; to be denied employment because you are disabled
Your editorial mockingly entitles this legislation the "Lawyers' Employment Act." For the 43 million people with disabilities and their families, this legislation is the "Emancipation Proclamation

Hong Kong financial institutions have been waiting for interest-rate futures for a long time.The contract was first proposed more than two years ago
but shortly afterward, the colony's markets were hit hard by the October 1987 global stock crash.The subsequent drive to reform Hong Kong's markets also has embroiled the interest-rate futures contract
the new contract essential to the revival of the Hong Kong Futures Exchange.that without a healthy futures exchange, Hong Kong's aspirations to be recognized as an international financial center will suffer
The contract will be based on the three-month Hong Kong interbank offered rate, or Hibor.It is almost a carbon copy of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Eurodollar contract, which is based on the three-month Eurodollar rate, the rate paid on U.S.-dollar deposits in London banks
If the contract is as successful as some expect, it may do much to restore confidence in futures trading in Hong Kong. "The contract is definitely important to the exchange
Two years ago, the futures exchange was the envy of other would-be futures centers.After only 17 months, its main contract had grown to be the second-largest stock-index-futures contract in the world
A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a commodity or financial instrument at a set price on a specified date.In the case of stock-index and interest-rate futures, the instruments are given an underlying cash value and are settled in cash
But in the week following the 1987 stock crash, the exchange verged on collapse, and the stock and futures markets in Hong Kong were closed for four days.Only a government-sponsored bailout kept the crisis from swallowing the exchange
Trading in Hang Seng index futures remains crippled by the experience.Volume for the entire month of September totaled only 21,687 contracts, compared with a daily average of 27,000 in the month before the 1987 crash
the futures market has shown itself to be resilient in two recent tests.While Asian markets struggled to cope with the uncertainty caused by the Oct. 13 plunge in New York stock prices, futures trading in Hong Kong was relatively heavy and went smoothly.That was also the case in the days following the June 4 massacre in Beijing, which caused a sharp drop in Hong Kong stock prices
Most important to the contract's success is the commitment of Hong Kong's big financial institutions, especially the two leaders, Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. and the local subsidiary of Britain's Standard Chartered Bank PLC.The two big banks were instrumental in designing the new contract
Colony banks have a major stake in how interest rates move because of their enormous Hong Kong-dollar exposure.Even though the currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar, with a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.8 to the American currency, the U.S. and Hong Kong economies don't always move in lock step, making it difficult to predict where interest rates in the colony will go
In early 1988, when the three-month Eurodollar rate was between 7% and 8%, the three-month Hibor rate was as low as 1%.Just a few months ago, the three-month Eurodollar rate was around 9.5%, while three-month Hibor hit highs above 11%
Despite the initial support expected, trading in the contract is likely to start slowly.The wounds from the 1987 crash haven't yet healed, and not all claims against the exchange clearinghouse -- by those who bet the Hang Seng index would fall -- have been settled
The wounds from the 1987 crash haven't yet healed, and not all claims against the exchange clearinghouse have been settled.Companies and financial institutions familiar with Hong Kong remain wary of trading in its futures market
that there may be limits on how much the contract can grow because the Hong Kong dollar isn't a widely traded currency.He says the contract will be considered a success if it starts trading 500 to 1,000 lots a day
that Hibor futures were designed for institutions and corporations, not for the type of small individual investors who were very active in Hang Seng index futures and defaulted in the 1987 crash.the low margin required for trading futures attracted a lot of small investors before the 1987 crash who didn't realize that their risk was virtually unlimited

Unocal said it expects to complete the sale of its Unocal Norge A/S unit by next March or April.In addition to an 18% stake in the Veslefrikk offshore field, the Norwegian unit has interests ranging from 10% to 25% in three other Norwegian oil and gas production licenses
In 1986, Unocal sold a 7.5% stake in the Veslefrikk field to Deutsche Erdolversorgungs G.m.b.H., a West German oil company, for an undisclosed amount.In 1987, it sold a 2.5% stake in the Veslefrikk field to the Swedish national oil company

That's the troubling conclusion reached by many international investors and money managers angry at the malfunctions on Continental stock exchanges during last week's global market turbulence.They say the recent market volatility has underscored the shortcomings of the way many European exchanges trade stocks
but the events of the past week have certainly exposed Europe's weaknesses.the problems on European exchanges included market-system breakdowns, delayed execution of buy and sell orders and trading suspensions

By Wednesday, frustrated Belgian brokers reopened the market by using the time-honored method of quoting stocks with chalk on a blackboard.The Belgian computer system finally was repaired and restarted on Tuesday of this week
As banks processed six-foot telexes of sell orders, the crush led to Manic Monday's worst decline: German stocks ended down 13%.Exchange officials extended trading hours, 75 minutes on Monday and 65 minutes on Tuesday, to clear up order backlogs
In France, more than half the top 25 blue-chip stocks didn't open until Wall Street rallied late in the European trading day.The rally transformed some big sell orders into big buy orders, solving an order-imbalance problem

It was a nightmare," says Susan Noble, an investment manager at Robert Fleming Holdings Ltd. 's International Investment Management unit in London. "It's very worrying that these markets can't cope
The switch to the London market during such turbulent times is significant.For one thing, the size of the affected market is enormous
the European stock markets account for some 22.5% of global stock market capitalization, with an estimated value of $2.175 trillion, according to Morgan Stanley Capital International.The Continental markets alone contribute about 14.3% of estimated world market capitalization of $9.671 trillion
that despite the economic restructuring associated with European Community efforts to develop a single market by 1992, European stock trading remains a highly fragmented and very localized activity.Against this backdrop, one thing that doesn't seem likely to result from 1992 is a single European stock market

that the charter will force EC countries to adopt a single pattern in labor relations.Workers and management would lose the "flexibility and diversity" that has so far allowed them to adapt to local conditions and traditions
The British government also strongly opposes the charter in its current form.It argues, as does Unice, that labor relations are best left to be regulated at the national level
But the cosmetic changes aren't expected to win over Britain. "We still have serious differences with the text
the charter would put poorer EC countries such as Spain, Greece and Portugal at a disadvantage.It would force these countries to introduce minimum standards for pay and working hours
Indeed, lower wages -- in Greece, they are a third of the EC average -- aren't enough to offset higher transport costs and lower productivity in the southern countries.Increasing labor costs would only put the countries at a further disadvantage in competing in the barrier-free EC market planned for after 1992
that producing a charter acceptable to both Britain and European industry isn't an unattainable goal.The charter would just have to be restricted to a list of workers' fundamental rights
A key provision in the current version of the charter would give the commission a mandate to produce an "action program" detailing on what points EC member states would be required to comply with the goals set out in the charter.This provision lies at the heart of the British and Unice fears of "social engineering" by the commission
One possible political solution would be for the commission to present the action program in late November, before the adoption of the charter at a summit of EC governments on Dec. 8 and 9.This would leave Britain free to adopt the charter after having rebutted the action program
The charter was approved by the EC Commission on Sept. 21.France's Socialist government, which currently holds the council's rotating presidency, is committed to having the charter adopted by all 12 EC states before the end of 1989 -- the bicentennial of the French revolution and its "Universal Declaration of Human Rights

And consumers "should be comfortable.I don't see anything on the horizon that could lead to a precipitous rise in the price

BEING A TRAVEL agent used to be pretty glamorous.Now it's getting downright dangerous
In recent months, more than 25 agencies have been robbed, compared with only a handful all last year, according to police and travel-agency groups.Most of the cases have been in California, where one agent was stabbed and another was shot and killed
the thieves seem to be part of a crime network that knows how to convert blank tickets into real ones.Already, the stolen tickets have been used for flights all over the world
Already, the stolen tickets have been used for flights all over the world.So far, the thieves have stolen 3,632 blank tickets, according to Airline Reporting Corp., a ticket processing center
Police say the robberies are usually pulled off by two to five men, who walk into the agencies near closing or lunch time, when few employees are there. "They looked like ordinary vacationers at first," says Willy LLerena, owner of Travel Air Service in Monte Bello, Calif., describing five men who entered his agency last June
But then they put two loaded pistols to his temple and demanded he open the safe.When he initially refused they stabbed him in the back and made off with $2,000 and 280 blank tickets
When he initially refused they stabbed him in the back.they wanted to show me how serious they were
As word of the crime spree has spread, many agents have started changing their open-door policies.At El Monte Travel Center in El Monte, Calif., customers now can get in only through a buzzer and lock system
At El Monte Travel Center in El Monte, Calif., customers now can get in only through a buzzer and lock system. "It's hard to deal with clients this way in a service business
The robberies also have set off a controversy involving the airlines.Agents say airlines, which track ticket numbers of all stolen tickets, should be doing more to catch the thieves by confiscating the tickets when they're used. "They have the most sophisticated computers in the world," says Mr. LLerena. "They ought to be able to do this." But airlines say it would be too expensive and cause too many delays if they started using computerized scanners to check tickets at the gate

CONSUMER advocates have long claimed that car rental companies charge too much for car rental insurance.Now, a new law in Texas seems to be providing the proof
Before the law went into effect last month, car rental companies were charging as much as $12 a day for the waiver in Texas.Now, they're charging as little $3 a day
Now, they're charging as little $3 a day. "If they're telling the truth now, then they've been charging 300% more than what is reasonable
But Hertz points out that at least it's now charging only $3.95 a day in Texas, while some competitors are charging $6.99.The state attorney general's office is investigating rental car agencies charging noticeably higher prices
major airlines sometimes make flight attendants work 16 hours or more straight.Some flight attendants on charter planes are putting in 20-hour work days
For instance, tired flight attendants might not react quickly enough during an emergency evacuation. "At the end of their day, they are zombies

Why do you continually ignore the salubrious effects of indexing the basis of capital gains for inflation?Why do you maintain the House-passed capital-gains plan is a "temporary" reduction when it is not
that you are confusing tax "rates" with tax "payments." Your Sept. 29 page-one story on the House-passed capital-gains plan is a good example
Your Sept. 29 page-one story on the House-passed capital-gains plan is a good example.You lead readers to believe that the House reduced the capital-gains tax for two years only
You lead readers to believe that the House reduced the capital-gains tax for two years only.You virtually ignore the tax-reducing power of indexation, which in many cases is more substantial than a lower rate
The monetary tax benefit of indexation for all gains in excess of inflation can be measured using the following equation: tax rate, times inflation rate, times basis for the gain.Depending on the size of the gain and the rate of inflation, indexation can mean a lower tax payment than using the 19.6% rate without indexation
the capital-gains reduction plan adopted by the House would not be temporary, but permanent.I hope that you begin talking about the plan's permanent and, in my view, most beneficial feature -- indexation
That the motivation for the two-year reduction to 19.6% is budgetary does not mean it is not in the public interest.The reduction eases the burden on portfolio changes and frees capital to seek more productive or more appropriate uses
But what is really significant is the indexation of capital gains after 1991.To argue that this is "not likely" to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense
To argue that this is "not likely" to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense.A large part of the long-term appreciation of assets reflects inflation, and the taxation of inflation-created capital gains is confiscation

Real, aftertax returns from financial assets are on the order of 1% or 2% a year.The capital-gains tax reform is a step toward correcting one of the gravest structural weaknesses of the U.S. economy, the closely connected phenomena of low savings rates, weak capital formation and high capital costs

Under the initial proposal, for example, banks would have been required to disclose that portion of allowances for loan losses that reflects specific letters of credit for which customers had defaulted.The final rule won't require such a breakdown of the allowances for loan losses, which appears on the balance sheet
The FASB rule will cover such financial instruments as interest rate swaps, financial guarantees, foward interest rate contracts, loan contracts, loan commitments and options written on securites held.It will require companies to spell out in more detail collateral polices and concentrations of credit risk for all financial instruments
Poughkeepsie also expects to post a one-time charge of $8.3 million, resulting in a net loss for the third quarter.The charge represents a write-down of the goodwill associated with Poughkeepsie's investment in the banks it is trying to sell and its North Carolina branches as well
The thrift announced the plan Aug. 21.Among other reasons, high fees regulators imposed on certain transfers of thrift deposits to commercial banks "substantially altered the economics of the transaction for both parties," Poughkeepsie said

they managed to induce bacteria to produce a non-toxic version of the poisons produced by the bacterium that causes whooping cough.Laboratory tests showed that non-toxic versions of the poisons are capable of inducing an immunity to whooping cough
The current vaccine for whooping cough, or pertussis, is part of the "DPT" (for diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) shot given most infants and young children.The vaccine is effective in preventing a disease that still afflicts about 60 million children a year world-wide, causing an estimated one million deaths
The vaccine, however, causes allergic reactions that can be fatal.The reactions stem from the fact that the vaccine contains multiple copies of the whole Bordetella pertussis bacterium, which causes whooping cough.This bacterium produces a toxin that, if used as a vaccine, can induce immunity to whooping cough.Unfortunately, the toxin is also poisonous

This bacterium produces a toxin that, if used as a vaccine, can induce immunity to whooping cough.Unfortunately, the toxin is also poisonous
they had succeeded in getting bacteria to produce a non-toxic version of the pertussis toxin, which could be used as a safe vaccine.they have been able to pluck the five genes that produced the toxin out of the pertussis bacterium.It turned out that although it took all five genes to produce the toxin, only one was responsible for the toxin's virulence. Ordinarily in genetic engineering each of these genes, minus the one that caused the virulence, would have been transferred to another bacterium, called E. coli, which would then produce a nonvirulent version of the toxin they did this, but the toxin didn't induce immunity to whooping cough. The scientists then took the five toxin genes and triggered a mutation in the one gene that caused virulence.Then, using a new technique (called homologous recombination) for introducing genes into cells, they transferred all five genes to bacteria closely related to the pertussis organism.These bacterial "cousins" ordinarily don't make the toxin.But the genes were accompanied by a piece of DNA, called a promoter, that turns the genes on. The new bacteria recipients of the genes began producing pertussis toxin which, because of the mutant virulence gene, was no longer toxic

In 1796, Mayer Amschel Rothschild founded Bankhaus M.A. Rothschild & Sons and later sent his four sons to London, Paris, Vienna and Naples to begin the bank's expansion during the early 19th century.The original bank in Frankfurt closed in 1901 after the death of Wilhelm Carl von Rothschild, and the family's banking activities focused on London and Paris
Much of the family's mystique remained.Although its palatial residence was destroyed by bombs during World War II, the Rothschilds' place in Frankfurt's history is still recalled by the city park and a street bearing the Rothschild name
The family's long absence is understandable.The family was in Allied countries during both World War I and the long period of economic strife of the 1920s
The family was in Allied countries during both World War I and the long period of economic strife of the 1920s.During the Third Reich, the Rothschilds were a target of Nazi propaganda against Jewish financiers
During the Third Reich, the Rothschilds were a target of Nazi propaganda against Jewish financiers.The persecution pursued the Rothschilds across Europe as the Nazis grabbed countries, confiscating the family's property in the process
Indeed, the competition isn't greatly concerned. "It would be surprising if they didn't come to Frankfurt in time for 1992, and they bring an interesting tradition.But the market really isn't going to be stood on its head," said a banker at one of Frankfurt's Big Three banks
The return of the Rothschilds is modest.The new representative office, with one manager and two assistants -- none a member of the Rothschild family -- will carry out no banking operations of its own
The constraints don't bother the office's 54-year-old manager, Erich Stromeyer.He left his job as general manager of Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. 's Frankfurt office because When the Rothschilds called, I couldn't resist
Each Rothschild bank is linked by family ties and cross-ownership.In March, N M Rothschild in London and Rothschild Bank in Zurich showed assets of #4.1 billion ($6.51 billion) and 1.26 billion Swiss francs ($774 million), respectively
In March, N M Rothschild in London and Rothschild Bank in Zurich showed assets of #4.1 billion ($6.51 billion) and 1.26 billion Swiss francs ($774 million), respectively.The Paris bank doesn't publish that figure
Obviously, there are quantitative limitations on the assistance we can provide," concedes Baron David de Rothschild, "but we feel we have some cards to play." Among them is the family's traditional ties to old wealth and decision-makers in banking and industry throughout Europe and beyond
The Rothschilds hope to use a long history in private banking and an aura of exclusivity to attract private and institutional investors.As at the Zurich bank, the minimum investment for individuals will be high: about a million German marks ($538,000), three times what many other West German investment banks require
A stock-index future is a contract to buy or sell the market value of a basket of stocks, such as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.Since stock futures were created in 1982, trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and other exchanges has boomed to the point where trading in stock-index futures rivals that in the stocks themselves
and the critics include some of the country's most successful investors.Warren Buffett has been on record as opposing stock-index futures since their inception in 1982
Essentially, the critics of stock-index futures fall into two camps.One group says the futures contribute to stock market volatility; the other contends that futures are a sideshow of speculation that detracts from the stock market's basic function of raising capital

Index arbitrage -- the rapid-fire buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in futures -- is frequently blamed for adding to stock market volatility.Although index arbitrage is said to add liquidity to markets, John Bachmann, managing partner of Edward D. Jones, says too much liquidity isn't a good thing
The kind of instant liquidity that is implied by index futures is that you can buy a portfolio over two years and get out in one day.It's too disruptive

But stock-index futures have plenty of support.Defenders say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for investors to reduce risks
Defenders say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for investors to reduce risks.They note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures
that trading baskets of stocks began in the 1970s, a decade before the advent of futures.Futures merely cut down on trading costs
blaming futures is like blaming the messenger." Since stock-index arbitrage merely narrows the gap between prices in the futures and stock markets, it can't add to volatility
And traders say that futures have become an accepted part of the financial landscape. "All life is about change -- either you adapt or die," says one Chicago futures trader
either you adapt or die.If futures aren't permitted here, we'll take it to Australia or Tokyo
Average daily volume in S&P 500 futures last year was 44,877 contracts.Based on yesterday's closing price of the S&P, the average value of one day's trading amounts to $7.6 billion
futures are useful as a way to hedge portfolios.If managers fear that the overall stock market will fall, but want to continue owning stocks, they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts

The S&P 500 index futures "transferred the identity of 500 stocks into one unit-making them a simple commodity to trade.It took away the need to know the bad third-quarter report of IBM, for example
Of course, portfolio trading -- the increasingly common practice of buying or selling baskets of actual stocks -- also treats stocks as homogenous commodities.

But owning index futures isn't the same as owning the underlying stocks.Stockholders, as a group, can win, because they own a share of corporate earnings, which can grow and boost stock prices
Futures, on the other hand, are a zero sum game -- a market for making side bets about the direction of stock prices. "You don't own anything

the commission voted, as expected, to formally object to the accord between Air France, the state-owned airline, and state-controlled domestic carrier Air Inter.the two companies will be notified so they can begin negotiations with Brussels on how to modify the pact
in which Air France gained access to five domestic French routes under Air Inter's flight numbers and the domestic airline got to fly to five cities outside of France under the flag of Air France.The two shared results from this route swap, and followed rules on ticket pricing
The EC Commission decided that such an accord doesn't benefit consumers enough to merit an exemption from antitrust law.The airlines presented it as offering consumers more choice and better flight connections
An Air France spokeswoman said, "we're absolutely ready to study all solutions." An Air Inter spokesman said, "Because they {the EC} have doubts, we will work again on the text and the contents of the accord

"The golden share is a single share, but it is the magic share
The government retained the single share after selling its stake in Jaguar in 1984 -- part of a nationalistic practice of protecting former government-owned enterprises to deflect criticism of privatization.The 15% restriction covers any would-be suitor, British or foreign
Ford is willing to bid for 100% of Jaguar's shares if both the government and Jaguar shareholders agree to relax the anti-takeover barrier prematurely.As Jaguar's biggest holder and Britain's biggest car maker, Ford could turn up the heat by convening a special shareholders' meeting and urging holders to drop the limits early
As Jaguar's biggest holder and Britain's biggest car maker, Ford could turn up the heat by convening a special shareholders' meeting and urging holders to drop the limits early.Ford might succeed because many shareholders are speculators keen for a full bid or institutional investors unhappy over Jaguar management's handling of its current financial difficulties
The government probably wouldn't give in readily to a hostile foray by Ford, however.It has relinquished a golden share only once before -- during British Petroleum Co. 's #2.5 billion ($4 billion) takeover of Britoil PLC in 1988

Some conservatives say Mr. Bush shouldn't make the trip.These critics object to Mr. Bush's participation in a meeting that includes Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega among the guests
I believe it will do more damage than good because it will legitimize people like Daniel Ortega.Mr. Windsor, among other analysts connected to the conservative Heritage Foundation, fears the gathering of 18 leaders, mostly from Central American nations, will force Mr. Bush "to explain and redeem himself" in the wake of charges that the U.S. failed to do enough to aid the removal of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega
At the same time, liberal and moderate Democrats note the irony of Mr. Bush's joining a celebration of Costa Rican democracy at a time his administration has sought sharp cuts in U.S. aid to the tiny country.The administration proposed only $57 million in so-called economic support funds for Costa Rica this year, down from the $90 million the U.S. provided last year
However, peace efforts by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias haven't always helped the country's cause in Washington.Mr. Arias's long-time refusal to support the U.S.'s campaign against leftist Nicaragua earned him the ire of the Reagan White House
I think Bush's going there is a helpful sign," said Sen. Terry Sanford (D., N.C.) a member of the Foreign Relations Committee who pushed to provide Costa Rica about the same amount of aid as it received last year.Lawmakers in both houses support the higher level
Administration officials defend Mr. Bush's decision to make the trip.While they acknowledge the president will attend several meals and a working session also attended by Mr. Ortega, they insist that Mr. Bush won't be extending the Nicaraguan leader any special courtesies
Let me say there is a symbolic component to this trip.There won't be any formal resolutions or communiques, I don't think.But we still see this as an opportunity to discuss many, many very important issues

Such is the fiber of the wool that woolly intellectuals let fly at gatherings of Harvard University's new Society of Nerds and Geeks, or SONG. SONGsters are mad as heck about campus anti-intellectualism and they aren't going to take it anymore, at least not without trying a few really neat ideas first
We could have called ourselves the Academic Intellectual Society, but then everyone would have said, `Oh, you mean the nerd-and-geek club, '" Leonid Fridman, SONG's graduate-student adviser, told 19 attendees at the club's inaugural meeting earlier this month.Membership has since swelled to between 20 and 25
Some people may think of nerds as calculator-toting, socially awkward individuals with shirt-pocket liners for their pencils and a preoccupation with computers and matters numerical.Geeks, by at least one definition, are chicken-mutilating circus freaks
But SONG founder Jeremy Kahn, a Harvard junior, thinks of nerds and geeks more as "nonconformists," albeit with a studious bent.One of the group's first projects is a "procrastination hot line" that students could call when they have an urge to delay studying
The club plans to show nerdy movies, such as "Real Genius," in which physics whizzes pop corn with lasers; and naturally, the "Revenge of the Nerds," a tale of college males with runny noses and ill-fitting pants.One of its "more ambitious goals" is to get Jaime Escalante, the Los Angeles high-school mathematics teacher featured in the film "Stand and Deliver," to come to Harvard for a guest lecture

At the same time, moves toward tighter air-quality standards are spurring interest in lighter or alternative fuels that don't pollute as much as fuel refined from "heavy" crudes, generally high in sulfur.Over the years, the world's stream of oil has been growing heavier
And some oil companies are trying to lock in future supplies.Typical is Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, Italy's state-owned energy company, which not long ago acquired through its AGIP oil subsidiary a 5% share in the consortium accounting for half of Nigeria's oil output

He made a special trip to examine U.S. environmental trends because they are often followed in Europe.ENI needs to know what's coming as it prepares to spend some $1.3 billion on upgrading its refineries
Oil companies world-wide will have "to spend a lot of money for the cleaner fuels that will be required," says John H. Lichtblau, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.It will go for work ranging from refinery modification to changes in the distribution system, including the way service stations pump fuel into cars
In the U.S., the search for oil had been headed toward environmentally sensitive areas believed to have vast reserves.Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge alone is thought to hide more than three billion barrels of oil
Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge alone is thought to hide more than three billion barrels of oil.Until the tanker spill, Big Oil was slowly convincing authorities it could safely produce from such places
Similarly, a group of companies led by Chevron Corp. has been unable to pump oil found off the California coast in the early 1980s.A huge production system built in the sea off Santa Barbara and ashore is sitting idle
But the push for cleaner fuels is increasing the attractiveness of natural gas.More than half the domestic drilling now under way is for gas
Activity has revived in the largest U.S. gas-producing regions, such as the Gulf of Mexico.Santa Fe International Corp is stepping up development of a well off Texas' Matagorda Island where it found gas in 1987

The proposals go far beyond the current and rather confused policies of perestroika, Mikhail Gorbachev's restructuring of the economy.They lay out a clear timetable and methodology for liberalizing the system of setting prices, breaking up huge industrial monopolies and putting unprofitable state-owned companies out of business
Although it was published unsigned in the latest edition of the weekly Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta, Soviet sources say the article was written by Leonid Abalkin and a small group of colleagues.Mr. Abalkin, head of the Academy of Science's Institute of Economics, was recently appointed deputy chairman of the Soviet government and head of a state commission on economic reform
But the proposals also display political savvy, couching some of the most controversial ideas in cautious language so as not to alienate powerful conservatives in the government who stand to lose out if they are implemented.Seeking a middle path between opponents of change and radicals who demand overnight solutions, the article advocates what it calls a "radical-moderate approach
The document is to be discussed at a conference of leading economists late this month, and will probably be presented to the Soviet Parliament for consideration this year.As policy-makers draw up proposals for the next five-year plan, which starts in 1991, the blueprint represents a powerful first shot in what is likely to be a fierce battle over economic reform
Instead, they map out a strategy in several phases from now until 1995.Most of the measures would probably only start to have an effect on beleaguered Soviet consumers in two to three years at the earliest

Albert Engelken and Robert Thomson had never met, though for 38 years their lives had been intertwined in a way peculiar to the sports world.Mr. Engelken, now a transit-association executive in Washington, D.C., and Mr. Thomson
Mr. Engelken, a rabid baseball fan, pores over the sports pages to chart the exploits of "my favorite and not-so-favorite teams and players." He often groans, he says, at the "clutter" of sports stories about drugs, alcohol, gambling and some player's lament "about the miserly millions he is offered to play the game
He often groans at the "clutter" of sports stories about drugs, alcohol, gambling and some player's lament "about the miserly millions he is offered to play the game." His morning paper, the Washington Post, even carries a sports column called "Jurisprudence" that recounts the latest arrests and convictions of players and team managers

His morning paper, the Washington Post, even carries a sports column called "Jurisprudence" that recounts the latest arrests and convictions of players and team managers.Like many sports buffs, Mr. Engelken has turned cynic
It was the ninth inning of the third game of a three-game playoff between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants.Baseball fans throughout New York had sweated out a long summer with their teams, and now it had come to this: a battle between the two for the National League pennant -- down to the last inning of the last game, no less
Some 34,320 fans jammed the stands, and shouted at the top of their lungs.Mr. Engelken was doing the same across the Hudson River in New Jersey, where, with his nose pressed against the front window of the Passaic-Clifton National Bank, he watched the duel on a television set the bank set up for the event
The playoff series had riveted the 12-year-old Giants fan. "The Giants struck first, winning the opener, 3-1, on a two-run homer off Dodger right-hander Ralph Branca," Mr. Engelken recalls with precision today

The rest, as they say, is history.Mr. Thomson, a tall, Scottish-born, right-hand hitter, stepped into the batter's box

And Bobby Thomson was made a legend.The same Bobby Thomson, it turns out, who sells those paper-goods today
Mr. Engelken and Mr. Thomson drifted in different directions in the subsequent years.Mr. Thomson played outfield and third base until 1960, posting a lifetime .270 batting average and chalking up 264 home runs before retiring and going into paper-goods sales. Mr. Engelken moved south to Washington
Mr. Engelken moved south to Washington, but he took with him enduring memories of the homer of 1951.When his wife, Betsy, came down the aisle on their wedding day in 1966, Mr. Engelken -- no slouch on the romantic front -- gave her the ultimate compliment: "You look prettier than Bobby Thomson's home run
When his wife, Betsy, came down the aisle on their wedding day in 1966, Mr. Engelken -- no slouch on the romantic front -- gave her the ultimate compliment: "You look prettier than Bobby Thomson's home run." The couple's first dog, Homer, was named after the Great Event
Mr. Engelken wrote his sports hero to tell him of the coincidence of events.Mr. Thomson sent off a card to Martha
Mr. Thomson sent off a card to Martha: "It doesn't seem like 25 years since I hit that home run to celebrate your birth," it read.Martha was pleased, but nowhere near as much as Mr. Engelken
And on Mr. Engelken's 40th birthday, his wife bought a book detailing the big homer and sent it off to Mr. Thomson to be autographed. "What could have been better?" asks Mr. Engelken
Betsy Engelken asked the same question earlier this year, when her husband was about to turn 50.She had an idea
On her husband's 50th birthday (after an auspicious 23 years of marriage, it should be noted), Betsy, Al and their college-bound son set out for New York to visit Fordham University.Mrs. Engelken had scheduled a stop on the New Jersey Turnpike to, she told her husband, pick up some papers for a neighbor
Mrs. Engelken had scheduled a stop on the New Jersey Turnpike to, she told her husband, pick up some papers for a neighbor.The papers would be handed over at a bank of telephone booths just off Exit 10
At the appointed exit, the family pulled over, and Mrs. Engelken went to get her papers.Mr. Engelken turned off the motor and rolled down the window
In a matter of minutes, she was back, with a tall, silver-haired man in tow.She crouched down by the car window and addressed her husband with her favorite nickname
She crouched down by the car window and addressed her husband with her favorite nickname: "Bertie," she said, "Happy 50th Birthday.This is Bobby Thomson

His hero signed photographs of the homer and diplomatically called Ralph Branca "a very fine pitcher." And when Mr. Engelken asked him why he took time off from work for somebody he didn't even know, Bobby Thomson replied: "You know, Albert, if you have the chance in life to make somebody this happy, you have an obligation to do it
But his fans, to his constant amazement, never let him forget the famous four-bagger.His mail regularly recalls "my one event," and has been growing in recent years
But when Betsy Engelken wrote him, saying she could stop near his New Jersey home, it seemed different. "What a good feeling it would be for me to do that," he says he thought
When the Engelken family got back from its trip up north, Mr. Engelken wrote it all down, just to make sure no detail was missed. "On the way home," his notes recall, "it took concentrated effort to keep that car pointed south
On the way home it took concentrated effort to keep that car pointed south.My mind was miles north at a place called Coogan's Bluff, where a real sports hero had captured the imagination of a kid who never fully grew up and is all the richer for it

Real heroes exist.You might not find one in the `Jurisprudence' column
When that agreement expires, Torstar will be free to increase its 22.4% stake in Southam, or to make an offer for the whole company.Descendants of the Southam family hold an additional 22.6% stake in the Toronto-based company, Canada's largest newspaper publisher
The newspaper could fetch between 15 million and 20 million Canadian dollars (US$12.8 million to $17.1 million), said one analyst.A spokesman for Southam declined to comment on the price the company is seeking or on estimates of the paper's annual losses
To be profitable, the paper requires more circulation and building circulation is an expensive undertaking," said John Macfarlane, the paper's publisher.Southam said the level of future investment required by the paper would have restricted its options in other areas
Possible bidders include Christopher Ondaatje, a Toronto financier and vice chairman of Hees International Bancorp Inc., a holding company controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family.Mr. Ondaatje sold his stake in Pagurian Corp. to Hees earlier this year and is said to be seeking a media acquisition
Mr. Ondaatje sold his stake in Pagurian Corp. to Hees earlier this year and is said to be seeking a media acquisition.Mr. Ondaatje couldn't be reached for comment, but Roy Mac-Laren, chairman of CB Media, a closely held concern that publishes two business magazines, said his company would take a close look at the newspaper
Southam agreed to sell its 47% stake in Selkirk Communications Ltd., a broadcasting concern, to Maclean Hunter Ltd. for about C$285 million last year.This year, it has moved to cut costs in its newspaper division through layoffs and asset sales, while reaching joint venture and acquisition agreements in other areas

However, the company's petroleum services segment, while profitable, was hurt by high financing costs associated with the company's buy-out of a 50% stake in Eastman Christensen Co. from Texas Eastern Corp. last June.Norton and Texas Eastern had each held a 50% stake in Eastman in a joint venture
For the nine months, Norton had net of $81.2 million, or $3.87 a share, and a tax credit of $4.4 million.In the year-earlier period, the company had net of $77.2 million, or $3.68 a share, and a tax credit of $7.7 million

The proposed legislation is aimed at rectifying some of the inequities in the current land-ownership system.Highlights of the bills, as currently framed, are: -- A restriction on the amount of real estate one family can own, to 660 square meters in the nation's six largest cities, but more in smaller cities and rural areas.The government will penalize offenders, but won't confiscate property. -- A tax of between 3% and 6% on property holdings that exceed the governmentset ceiling. -- Taxes of between 15% and 50% a year on "excessive" profits from the resale of property, or the sale of idle land to the government.The government defines excessive profits as those above the average realized for other similar-sized properties in an area. -- Grace periods ranging from two to five years before the full scope of the penalties takes effect

But others, large landowners, real-estate developers and business leaders, say the government's proposals are intolerable.the critics are lobbying for the government to weaken its proposed restrictions and penalties
Government officials who are urging real-estate reforms balk at the arguments of business leaders and chafe at their pressure. "There is no violation of the capitalistic principle of private property in what we are doing," says Lee Kyu Hwang, director of the government's Land Bureau, which drafted the bills

Under those measures, financial institutions would be restricted from owning any more real estate than they need for their business operations.Banks, investment and credit firms would be permitted to own land equivalent in value to 50% of their capital -- currently the proportion is 75%

The soft-spoken, silver-haired Manhattan borough president -- the first black man to win the Democratic nomination for mayor here -- doesn't have a single prominent political enemy.While he is widely described as a man with deep convictions, he has few major political programs that he can call his own
While he is widely described as a man with deep convictions, he has few major political programs that he can call his own.Asked about his greatest achievement in public life, he first speaks about the quality of his staff
Now, as election day nears, even some supporters wonder what he will do if he wins the mayoralty on Nov. 7.They wonder whether he can be firm with his longtime allies
They wonder whether he can be firm with his longtime allies.They wonder whether he has the economic know-how to steer the city through a possible fiscal crisis
and they wonder who will be advising him.Will he, if he wins, be in the thrall of the most liberal of his allies, who advocate such policies as rent control for commercial buildings, or will he tilt toward the real-estate interests that have funneled money into his campaign
In an interview with reporters and editors of The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dinkins appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the mayoralty. "A lot of people think I will give away the store, but I can assure you I will not," he says
but I can assure you I will not.I am aware we have real budgetary problems
The city is full of aging bridges, water mains and roadways that are in need of billions of dollars worth of repair.Renewed efforts to fight drugs and crime will be costly
but that won't be enough.New York State Comptroller Edward Regan predicts a $1.3 billion budget gap for the city's next fiscal year
New York State Comptroller Edward Regan predicts a $1.3 billion budget gap for the city's next fiscal year, a gap that could grow if there is a recession.If elected, Mr. Dinkins will probably have no choice but to raise taxes on overburdened businesses or cut spending in already under-serviced neighborhoods
He is going to face a mess.His supporters are not venal, but their solution to everything will be to spend more money, and he won't have any money
By and large, Mr. Dinkins has finessed the touchy question of whose ox he would gore.Instead of focusing on the financial future, Mr. Dinkins has sold himself as a unifier for a city recently touched by racial violence and as a soothing antidote to 12 years of commotion generated by Mayor Koch
Instead of focusing on the financial future, Mr. Dinkins has sold himself as a unifier for a city recently touched by racial violence and as a soothing antidote to 12 years of commotion generated by Mayor Koch. "The thing about the Dinkins candidacy is that it offers hope to a broad range of people
The thing about the Dinkins candidacy is that it offers hope to a broad range of people.It is a feel-good candidacy
No doubt, Mr. Dinkins has been a calming influence.He is an avuncular figure who remembers the birthdays of colleagues' children, opens doors for women, and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody
He is an avuncular figure who remembers the birthdays of colleagues' children, opens doors for women, and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody.More important, he emerged as a peacemaker last summer after the Central Park rape of a white jogger and the racial murder of a black teen-ager in the white Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst
More important, he emerged as a peacemaker last summer after the Central Park rape of a white jogger and the racial murder of a black teen-ager in the white Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst.Rather than scaring off white voters, as many predicted he would, Mr. Dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head
Rather than scaring off white voters, as many predicted he would, Mr. Dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head. (Keeping cool is a Dinkins priority: On humid days this summer, he was known to change his double-breasted suits as many as four times a day
But even in his front-runner campaign, he has shown signs of the indecisiveness and confusion that some say has plagued his tenure as Manhattan borough president -- and might hinder him as mayor.Over the last few weeks, he has frittered away roughly half of what was once a 33-point lead in the polls over Mr. Giuliani
Over the last few weeks, he has frittered away roughly half of what was once a 33-point lead in the polls over Mr. Giuliani.A story about how he mishandled the sale to his son of his stock in a media company controlled by his political patron Percy Sutton was allowed to fester a full week before Mr. Dinkins faced the media
A story about how he mishandled the sale to his son of his stock in a media company controlled by his political patron Percy Sutton was allowed to fester a full week before Mr. Dinkins faced the media.He has canceled numerous campaign appointments and was largely inaccessible to the media until the stock story broke
His campaign was caught flat-footed amid allegations it paid almost $10,000 for what it said was a "get-out-the-vote" effort by black activist Sonny Carson, a convicted kidnapper who later said publicly that he is "anti-white." Critics have said the payment looked like an attempt by the Dinkins camp to get Mr. Carson to stop leading confrontational demonstrations protesting the Bensonhurst murder
These campaign problems have echoed difficulties Mr. Dinkins has run into before.A former U.S. Marine, Mr. Dinkins got off to a quick start in politics, joining a local Democratic political club in the 1950s, linking up with black urban leaders such as Charles Rangel, Basil Paterson and Mr. Sutton, and getting himself elected to the state assembly in 1965
But his chance to become deputy mayor under Mayor Abraham Beame.I always thought of this as a thing that could always be done tomorrow," he said at the time
Later, Mr. Dinkins became more deeply indebted to Mr. Sutton and other city pols, including then-City Council President Paul O'Dwyer, when they helped him get appointed city clerk, a largely ceremonial post responsible for the city's marriage bureau, among other things. (Mr.O'Dwyer is now one of the lawyers for Mr. Sutton's media company
The debt rose further in 1977 when Mr. Sutton resigned his position as Manhattan borough president to run for mayor.Mr. Sutton recalls: "When I left, I sat down with Charlie {Rangel}, Basil {Paterson} and David, and David said, 'Who will run for borough president
and was best known among city politicians for his problems making up his mind on matters before the city's Board of Estimate.Colleagues today recall with some humor how meetings would crawl into the early morning hours as Mr. Dinkins would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office to discuss, en masse, certain controversial proposals
Colleagues today recall with some humor how meetings would crawl into the early morning hours as Mr. Dinkins would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office to discuss, en masse, certain controversial proposals. "He taught me how to drink herbal tea instead of coffee at 3 a.m., I'll give him that," says Deputy Mayor Robert Esnard
Often, Mr. Dinkins's procrastination prevented him from having a say in the way things turned out.On the campaign stump, he often points out that he was the only Board of Estimate member to vote against a controversial real-estate project at Manhattan's Columbus Circle.But board members say he took so long to decide how to vote that by the time he decided, it was too late to try to draw other members to his position
he took so long to decide how to vote that by the time he decided, it was too late to try to draw other members to his position.Everybody else had brought in the wagons and made their deal.He would have got a lot more done if he made up his mind faster
Everybody else had brought in the wagons and made their deal.He would have got a lot more done if he made up his mind faster
One Board member, Bronx Borough President Ferdinand Ferrer, was said to be so impatient with Mr. Dinkins's behavior at many meetings that he withheld his support for Mr. Dinkins's mayoral effort until late in the primary campaign. "I had some problem from time to time on the length of time he would take to make up his mind
that the Manhattan borough president has taken too long to decide important issues. "We didn't rubber-stamp everything that came to us
On some occasions when Mr. Dinkins has discussed the issues during the campaign, he has run into a familiar kind of trouble.Some supporters were stunned this summer when Mr. Dinkins suggested weakening the law forbidding public employees to go on strike
Some supporters were stunned this summer when Mr. Dinkins suggested weakening the law forbidding public employees to go on strike.He withdrew the remark
He withdrew the remark.When he later sided with striking hospital workers, some allies cringed a little more, concerned that Mr. Dinkins was setting the wrong tone for coming contract negotiations with city employees
Then, two days before receiving an endorsement from environmental groups, Mr. Dinkins promised he would issue a three-year moratorium on construction of garbage-incinerator plants.That announcement was roundly criticized by Mayor Koch -- who has endorsed Mr. Dinkins -- because the city faces a garbage crisis and has already spent $5 million planning for an incinerator that would be scrapped under Mr. Dinkins's proposal
Mr. Dinkins's position papers have more consistently reflected anti-development sentiment.He favors a form of commercial rent control, which the financial community believes would make it more difficult to attract investment in the city
He favors a form of commercial rent control, which the financial community believes would make it more difficult to attract investment in the city.In the midst of a labor shortage, he proposes linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of hiring New York City residents
In the midst of a labor shortage, he proposes linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of hiring New York City residents.With an untrained local labor pool that policy could drive businesses from the city
And he favors a more cooperative approach toward the neighboring states of New Jersey and Connecticut in the battle over companies thinking of moving employees out of New York City.the Koch administration's aggressive approach helped save 5,000 Chase Manhattan Bank jobs from moving across the Hudson
But Mr. Dinkins's economic planks don't seem to bother the business community.Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, an industry organization, says Mr. Dinkins's "economic development program is shortsighted, but when it comes down to it, he can be reasonable
Mr. Dinkins's inner circle of advisers appears to include both ideologues and pragmatists.The key man seems to be the campaign manager, Mr. Lynch
The key man seems to be the campaign manager, Mr. Lynch.A disheveled, roly-poly son of a Long Island potato farmer, Mr. Lynch is a veteran union organizer who worked on the presidential campaigns of Sen. Edward Kennedy and Mr. Jackson
Another close ally is Ruth Messinger, a Manhattan city councilwoman, some of whose programs, such as commercial rent control, have made their way into Mr. Dinkins's position papers.If she remains influential with Mr. Dinkins, as some suggest she will, his mayoralty may take on a more anti-development flavor
Some business leaders and others also believe that Mr. Dinkins would place significant responsibility in the hands of a deputy mayor with a strong administrative background.Names of possible deputies that have surfaced include former mayoral candidate Richard Ravitch, former schools chancellor Frank Macchiarola and Messrs.Leventhal and Gliedman
Then there are Mr. Dinkins's old-time Harlem colleagues, such as U.S. Rep. Rangel, former Deputy Mayor Paterson and Mr. Sutton.Having attained positions of real influence or wealth, these men constitute the Old Guard of New York City black politics
Having attained positions of real influence or wealth, these men constitute the Old Guard of New York City black politics; they are less confrontational than the younger, more activist black political community that has been based largely in Brooklyn
they are less confrontational than the younger, more activist black political community that has been based largely in Brooklyn. (Part of Mr. Dinkins's strength is his ability to win the support of both the Brooklyn and Harlem factions
We know there are potholes for the city out there.If any of us think we're going to sidetrack David's determination to be the best possible mayor because of his obligations to us, we are making a sad mistake
If any of us think we're going to sidetrack David's determination to be the best possible mayor because of his obligations to us, we are making a sad mistake.You have to remember David is a pragmatist
But Mr. Dinkins's sense of pragmatism often comes across more as an insider's determination not to upset the political apple cart.He is taken aback in an interview when asked whether, as mayor, he plans on reforming the political "fiefdoms" that perpetuate the monumental ineffectiveness of New York's school system
He is taken aback in an interview when asked whether, as mayor, he plans on reforming the political "fiefdoms" that perpetuate the monumental ineffectiveness of New York's school system. "I will sit down and talk some of the problems out, but take on the political system?Uh-uh," he says with a shake of the head
Despite many doubts about his candidacy, white New Yorkers aren't expected to desert in sufficient numbers to turn the election to Mr. Giuliani.The former U.S. attorney, who prosecuted targets ranging from Mafia dons to Wall Street executives, has succeeded in raising questions about Mr. Dinkins's ethical standards, but so far has failed to generate excitement about his own candidacy

The petite, 29-year-old Ms. Johnson, dressed in jeans and a sweatshirt as she slogs through the steady afternoon rain, is a claims adjuster with Aetna Life & Casualty.She has been on the move almost incessantly since last Thursday, when an army of adjusters, employed by major insurers, invaded the San Francisco area to help policyholders sift through the rubble and restore some order to their lives
they parcel out money so their clients can find temporary living quarters, buy food, replace lost clothing, repair broken water heaters, and replaster walls.Some of the funds will used to demolish unstable buildings and clear sites for future construction

Since commercial airline flights were disrupted, the company chartered three planes to fly these executives back to the West Coast and bring along portable computers, cellular phones and some claims adjusters.Because of the difficulty of assessing the damages caused by the earthquake, Aetna pulled together a team of its most experienced claims adjusters from around the country

The secret to being a good adjuster is counting.You have to count everything
But they must also assign a price to each of these items as well as to floors, wallcoverings, roofing and siding, to come up with a total value for a house.To do that, they must think in terms of sheetrock by the square foot, carpeting by the square yard, wallpaper by the roll, molding by the linear foot
To do that, they must think in terms of sheetrock by the square foot, carpeting by the square yard, wallpaper by the roll, molding by the linear foot.Using a calculator and a unit-price guide for such jobs as painting, plumbing and roofing in each major region of the country, adjusters can figure out the value of a home in today's market and what it would cost to rebuild it
Sometimes repairs are out of the question.When Aetna adjuster Bill Schaeffer visited a retired couple in Oakland last Thursday, he found them living in a mobile home parked in front of their yard. The house itself, located about 50 yards from the collapsed section of double-decker highway Interstate 880, was pushed about four feet off its foundation and then collapsed into its basement

The FCC moves were good news for AT&T, which has been striving since the breakup of the phone system for greater latitude in pricing and reduced regulation.Alfred Sikes, the new FCC chairman, championed deregulation of AT&T at his last job as head of a Commerce Department telecommunications agency
It means that Sikes is serious about the deregulation of long distance," said Jack Grubman, a telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber Inc., who attended the FCC meeting. "All the commissioners were in amazing agreement {to re-examine regulation} for only having been together for a few months
The FCC took three specific actions regarding AT&T.By a 4-0 vote, it allowed AT&T to continue offering special discount packages to big customers
AT&T gave a 5% to 10% discount to the Memphis, Tenn., company that oversees Holiday Inns, in response to a similar discount offered to Holiday Corp. by MCI Communications Corp.that because MCI's offer had expired AT&T couldn't continue to offer its discount plan
AT&T offered a similar Tariff 15 discount to Resort Condominium International, of Indianapolis, to meet another MCI bid.The FCC "didn't say I couldn't do it again
they expect to re-examine how AT&T is regulated since competition has increased.the agency to propose new rules next year
AT&T applauded the FCC's actions. "The time is long overdue to take a look at the fierce competition in the long-distance business and the rules governing it," the New York telecommunications firm said in a statement
it was "obviously disappointed" with the FCC decision on Tariff 12.it will petition the FCC decision in federal court

The AT&T action was the most recent blow in a nasty fight.Earlier this month, MCI sued AT&T in federal district court, claiming that AT&T's ads are false
AT&T assembled three of its top executives in Washington, all visibly angry, to try to refute MCI's charges. "MCI has made hawks out of the upper echelon of AT&T," said PaineWebber's Mr. Grubman, who said he expected AT&T to become increasingly aggressive in dealing with its longtime nemesis
In the past two months the nation's 88 junk funds have lost a total of about $6 billion -- more than 15% of assets -- through sales or transfers of junk-fund shares, Dalbar says.It made the estimates based on data collected from more than a dozen big junk funds
Interviews with three major fund groups confirm the trend.Their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly $500 million, or about 13% of their junk fund assets, in the past two months
negative publicity has exacerbated investors' concern about recent declines in junk-bond prices. "People have been seeing headline after headline after headline and saying: `I can't take it anymore -- I'm getting out

About $60 million streamed out last week alone, double the level of the week following last month's Campeau Corp. credit squeeze.About 98% of the outflow was transferred to other Fidelity funds, says Neal Litvack, a Fidelity vice president, marketing, with most going into money market funds
You get a news item, it hits, you have strong redemptions that day and for two days following -- then go back to normal," says Mr. Litvack.The fund, with a cash cushion of more than 10%, has "met all the redemptions without having to sell one thing," Mr. Litvack says
The fund, with a cash cushion of more than 10%, has "met all the redemptions without having to sell one thing.Our fund has had {positive} net sales every month for the last three years -- until this month

Through Oct. 19, high-yield funds had an average 0.85% total return (the price change plus dividends on fund shares), according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. That's even less than the 4.35% total return of the Merrill Lynch High-Yield Index
Fidelity's junk fund has fallen 2.08% this year through Oct. 19.the Vanguard fund rose 1.84%
People who remain in junk funds now could get hit again.Many funds in recent weeks and months have been selling their highest-quality junk issues, such as RJR Nabisco, to raise cash to meet expected redemptions. Funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of less-creditworthy borrowers.And then, asset values of the funds could plunge more than they have so far

On an office wall of the Senate intelligence committee hangs a quote from Chairman David Boren, "Don't hold your ticket 'til the show's over." He once used that line in a closed-door meeting on Panama, meaning don't shrink from taking action against Manuel Noriega
But the broader truth is more complicated -- and dismaying.The policy was contained in an exchange of letters last October between the Senate intelligence committee and the CIA and National Security Council.Staff lawyers for both sides were busy agreeing with one another about what the U.S. could not do to oust the Panamanian thug.They simply got carried away with interpreting what the executive order banning assassinations really meant.Mr. Boren himself didn't discover the warn-your-enemy nuance until Mr. Bush told him privately at the White House last week

So the administration dropped it.By October, when the committee rejected a much more modest covert proposal, even the administration was agreeing little should be done
but he does concede that Congress has made mistakes. "In the aftermath of Vietnam, in the aftermath of Iran-Contra, I can understand some people might think that if they plan a coup, they have to bring their lawyers," he says
But even Mr. Boren defends congressional oversight.Writing in the Harvard International Review, he says that his committee approves covert operations only when there's a "consensus
it means a bipartisan majority. "The sustainability of U.S. foreign policy is essential Why was containment so successful?Because it had bipartisan support

Vandenberg and Rayburn were wise enough to leave specific operations to presidents; modern senators, Mr. Boren notwithstanding, are less modest

We lived in rural areas many years, but now live in St. Louis County, Mo.This morning as I drove the 13 miles to my law office and endured the routine heavy traffic during that twice-daily journey, I thought of how fortunate it was that we made the decision to be residents of an expanding community with so many opportunities and where so much is happening

At stake are almost 10,000 jobs in an industry that has been the mainstay of Finland's post-war economic revival.Shipbuilding became a point of pride as Finnish shipyards remained profitable long after rivals collapsed all over Europe
But if, as many now fear, Waertsilae Marine joins the ranks of failed shipyards it might turn out to be remembered most as a blemish on Finland's international reputation.The shipyard's 6.5 billion Finnish markka ($1.54 billion) backlog includes about 20 ships ordered by big international shippers, including three for Carnival Cruise Lines Inc
Miami-based Carnival said the first of the three ships is scheduled to be delivered next month, just in time for the winter tourist season in the Caribbean.The second ship is scheduled to be delivered in fall 1990 and the third in fall 1991
The second ship is scheduled to be delivered in fall 1990 and the third in fall 1991.One analyst said the first ship probably will be delivered close to schedule, but that Carnival may have to pay up to 25% more to get the second and third ships
All the ships are covered by loan guarantees from a state export financing agency, even though it's not clear whether they will actually be built.Bankers worry that if the government makes good a threat to withdraw its guarantee commitments, shippers will counter with a hail of lawsuits
However, some bankers cited possible parallels between the Waertsilae Marine case and the collapse of Norway's state-owned Kongsberg Vappenfabrikk AS two years ago.In that case, international banks and investors incurred big losses because they incorrectly believed the company's debt carried implicit state guarantees
The decision by a majority of state-appointed Waertsilae Marine directors Monday to file for bankruptcy was an abrupt about-face from previous government policy.In August, the government played a major part in a sweeping restructuring of the troubled shipyard
At the time 71%-controlled by Oy Waertsilae, a conglomerate, the shipbuilding unit faced potential losses estimated at one billion markka and was on the brink of liquidation.Under the rescue plan, Waertsilae sold 51% of its stake to a group of banks and pension funds
Government officials were expected to combine Waertsilae Marine with two other struggling firms.The government spent most of last year attempting to carry out such a plan
Mr. Suominen had grown increasingly worried about the state's potential financial exposure as Waertsilae Marine's losses ballooned to more than double the figure estimated in August.that Mr. Suominen may have decided to cut Finland's losses once and for all
Senior ministry officials huddled with creditors during the week in an attempt to agree on some form of restructuring that would keep Waertsilae Marine operating.The talks may drag on for weeks before any concrete result is announced
The offering included $550 million of 12% senior subordinated debentures due 2001 and $200 million of zero coupon liquid yield option notes due 2004.The notes were priced to yield 8% and are convertible into the company's Class B common stock at a price which represents a 15% premium over the market price on Oct. 10, 1989

The warning by the U.S. attorney's office follows two decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court last June.In those cases, the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes, including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment
Mr. Antar is being investigated by a federal grand jury in Newark, where prosecutors have told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges.Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, or RICO, the government has the authority to seek to freeze or seize a defendant's assets before trial
According to individuals familiar with Mr. Antar's case, prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of Mr. Antar's attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure.In a letter, prosecutors told Mr. Antar's lawyers that because of the recent Supreme Court rulings, they could expect that any fees collected from Mr. Antar may be seized
In a letter, prosecutors told Mr. Antar's lawyers that because of the recent Supreme Court rulings, they could expect that any fees collected from Mr. Antar may be seized.Prosecutors have told Mr. Antar's attorneys that they believe Mr. Antar's allegedly ill-gotten gains are so great that any money he has used to pay attorneys derives from illegal activities.Therefore, they said, the money can be taken from the lawyers even after they are paid
there's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney's fees to drug cases.his office "just responded to an attorney's question about whether we would go after attorney's fees, and that is different from actually doing it, although we reserve that right
Mr. Antar was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in Newark by the Securities and Exchange Commission.In that suit, the SEC accused Mr. Antar of engaging in a "massive financial fraud" to overstate the earnings of Crazy Eddie, Edison, N.J., over a three-year period
In that suit, the SEC accused Mr. Antar of engaging in a "massive financial fraud" to overstate the earnings of Crazy Eddie, Edison, N.J., over a three-year period.Through his lawyers, Mr. Antar has denied allegations in the SEC suit and in civil suits previously filed by shareholders against Mr. Antar and others
that Mr. Antar aimed to pump up the company's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits.Mr. Antar made more than $60 million from the sale of his shares between 1985 and 1987
that the government's fee-forfeiture power is to be used sparingly.According to department policy, prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made
The stock market correction of Oct. 13, 1989, was a grim reminder of the Oct. 19, 1987 market collapse.Since, like earthquakes, stock market disturbances will always be with us, it is prudent to take all possible precautions against another such market collapse

that last week a customer discovered two flaws in its 80486 microprocessor chip's "floating-point unit", a set of circuits that do certain calculations.On Friday, Intel began notifying customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some mathematical calculations
the flaws don't affect them. "Bugs like this are just a normal part of product development

Nonetheless, concern about the chip may have been responsible for a decline of 87.5 cents in Intel's stock to $32 a share yesterday in over-the-counter trading, on volume of 3,609,800 shares, and partly responsible for a drop in Compaq's stock in New York Stock Exchange composite trading on Wednesday.Yesterday, Compaq plunged further
it had corrected the problems and would start producing bugless chips next week. "We should not be seeing any more

In late September, IBM began shipping a plug-in card that converts its PS/2 model 70-A21 from a 80386 machine to an 80486 machine.the company told customers Monday about the bugs and temporarily stopped shipping the product
IBM has no plans to recall its add-on cards and could probably circumvent the bugs without long product delays. "We don't look at this as a major problem for us
Compaq, which said it discovered the bugs, still plans to announce new 486 products on Nov. 6.Because of the glitch, however, the company said it doesn't know when its machine will be commercially available.That's a break from Compaq tradition, because the company doesn't announce products until they're actually at the dealers
The problem is being ballyhooed, experts say, because the 486 is Intel's future flagship.Intel's microprocessors are the chips of choice in many of today's personal computers and the 80486 microprocessor is the spearhead of the company's bid to guard that spot in the next generation of machines
Unveiled last April, the chip crams 1.2 million transistors on a sliver of silicon, more than four times as many as on Intel's earlier model, 80386.Intel clocks the chip's speed at 15 million instructions per second, or MIPs

That's what will keep computer makers coming in spite of the irritation of bugs.Big personal computer makers and many makers of engineering workstations are developing 486-based machines, which are expected to reach the market early next year

The other element includes consolidating BethForge's press-forge operations.The entire division employs about 850 workers
it is significant because it marks the first time the nation's No. 2 steelmaker has joined forces with a foreign partner.Wall Street analysts have criticized Bethlehem for not following its major competitors in linking with a foreign company to share costs and provide technology to modernize old facilities or build new ones
We think it's a step in the right direction for Bethlehem.It's important to share the risk and even more so when the market has already peaked
He said the move could be the beginning of a broader relationship between the two companies, one that could open up new markets for Bethlehem.Bethlehem had little choice but to go with a European steelmaker, because its competitors already have tapped the Japanese and South Korean industry leaders, analysts noted

Bethlehem is also working with the United Steelworkers union to consolidate BethForge's two machine shops and four heat-treatment facilities of the press-forge operations.Once the consolidation is complete, Bethlehem plans to concentrate its forgings business on nuclear fabrication, hardened steel and large-diameter steel rolls for rolling mills and selected custom-die applications
Bethlehem said earlier this year that it planned to restructure the BethForge division to improve its cost structure.In the second quarter, Bethlehem posted a $50 million charge related to its plans to realign the division

New York authorities reacted with concern and even some anger to the idea of the nation's third-largest corporation leaving without giving them an opportunity to accommodate it.

he asked the Working Group on Financial Markets to determine whether futures margins are too low.He noted that some minimum margin requirements have been reduced to levels below those before the 1987 crash
This raises questions whether futures and equity margin requirements are consistent at these levels and whether futures margins are adequate," Mr. Brady said.Margins are the amount of money an investor needs to put up to buy or sell a futures contract
Margins are the amount of money an investor needs to put up to buy or sell a futures contract.Margins on the futures exchanges typically are raised and lowered according to market volatility
Margins were raised or lowered about a dozen times since the crash Oct. 19, 1987.Currently, they stand at $12,000 for speculators, who are typically individuals and non-member traders, and $6,000 for hedgers, which are usually institutions and have offsetting positions in the underlying stocks
Mr. Brady also said he expects the leveraged buy-out phenomenon to "end under (its) own weight." Asked whether there is anything Congress should do to curb the LBO boom, Mr. Brady responded, "I think the LBO phenomenon, (while) it won't stop completely, will be a thing of the past
Asked whether there is anything Congress should do to curb the LBO boom, Mr. Brady responded, "I think the LBO phenomenon, (while) it won't stop completely, will be a thing of the past." Before taking any action, he advised the panel to "see what the market has produced as a cure
The former Wall Street executive refused to offer an opinion on the controversy surrounding program trading.I do not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time," he said
But Mr. Brady endorsed the market-revision bill that both houses of Congress will try to push through this session.That bill, proposed by the SEC last year, would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial positions of their holding companies, mandate large traders' reporting of program or block trades, and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets
The Senate Agriculture Committee is responding to trading abuses in the futures markets with a far-reaching bill that would become the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1989.The proposed legislation has a laudable goal: to assure the integrity of the U.S. futures markets
The complex bill covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and would profoundly change the way the industry is regulated.These include provisions relating to the technology and systems that must be employed by exchanges, oversight and disciplinary procedures for exchange trading practices, the relationship between commodity brokerage firms and floor traders, and exchange governance
One of the most prominent features is the requirement that in three years all exchanges have in place a system that records all trades by a source independent of the executing broker.The New York futures exchanges have been working together to develop a trade recording system much like the one called for in the bill
The New York futures exchanges have been working together to develop a trade recording system much like the one called for in the bill.We would be delighted to have such a system in place today

The U.S. exchanges need both market integrity and cost-efficiency; long-term growth depends on it
The Senate bill contains many provisions that will increase the costs of trading.The most arbitrary of these is the imposition of "service fees," which will directly widen the cost spread between U.S. and foreign markets. Other provisions have a more subtle, but nonetheless real and detrimental effect on the international position of U.S. exchanges.These include the extension of liability into areas beyond those established by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability to include punitive damages. In addition to increasing costs as a result of greater financial exposure for members, these measures could have other, far-reaching repercussions. One section of the bill would make all commodity brokerage firms and floor brokers liable for damages without willful misconduct.Nowhere in the federal securities law is simple negligence or inadvertent action a source of liability under similar circumstances. It is only logical to assume that the enactment of this provision will lead to increased litigation.In an already low-profitmargin business, commodity brokerage firms may well decide to eliminate the risk and expense of dealing with the retail public, depriving the private individual of access to the markets. Another measure makes commodity brokerage firms liable for violations committed by independent floor brokers who execute trades for them.This untried concept would expose these firms to potentially astronomical punitive damages. Faced with the virtually impossible task of supervising the execution of each trade, many commodity brokerage firms are likely to stop doing business with independents and instead hire their own salaried floor brokers.This would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor brokers.A consequence of their departure could be a serious diminution of market liquidity. Finally, under the bill, a number of legitimate, longstanding business practices would be arbitrarily banned, unless the CFTC were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue.In other words, regulation will occur through inaction and happenstance, rather than through a normal deliberative procedure. The affected practices include the placing of oral orders, which is the way most public customer orders are placed, and trading between affiliated brokers, even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client.Also precluded would be dual trading, whereby a broker trades for customers as well as his own account, a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets

When problems surface, the temptation becomes strong to summarily overhaul a market system that has served for more than 100 years.That temptation must be put aside to permit careful consideration of all the implications, positive and negative, of the proposed resolutions to those problems, and to avoid creating a marketplace where no one trades

They also chart the evolution of a city that has grown tenfold in the author's lifetime, from a colonial outpost of fez-wearing pashas to a Third World slum choking on its own refuse. "Soon it'll be so crowded," a narrator complains, "that people will start eating each other
The Beginning and the End," easily the best of the three, belongs to Mr. Mahfouz's "realistic" period and it is the one for which he is most renowned.Published in 1949, it follows the decline of a Cairo family with the saga-like sweep and rich detail that critics often compare to Dickens, Balzac and Galsworthy
dooming his family to poverty and eventual disgrace.His daughter turns to dressmaking, then to peddling herself for a few piasters
His daughter turns to dressmaking, then to peddling herself for a few piasters.One son sacrifices his own career so that his avaricious brother can succeed
The real tragedy, though, lies not in the family's circumstances but in its concern for appearances.Mourning for the father is overshadowed by the shame of burying him in a pauper's grave
Mourning for the father is overshadowed by the shame of burying him in a pauper's grave.The family moves to another house at night to conceal shabby belongings from neighbors
But its unsentimental sketches of Cairo life are vintage Mahfouz.We see, smell and hear slums filled with "the echoes of hawkers advertising their wares interspersed with abusive language, rattling coughs and the sound of people gathering spittle in their throats and spewing into the street
And we meet engaging crooks, such as Hassan "the Head," famed for his head-butting fights, his whoring and his hashish. "`God has not yet ordained that I should have earnings, ' he tells his worried mother
God has not yet ordained that I should have earnings, ' he tells his worried mother." Hassan comes to a bad end, but so does almost everyone else in the book
the prose is closer to Balzac's "Pere Goriot" than it is to "Arabian Nights." Mr. Mahfouz began writing when there was no novelistic tradition in Arabic, and he modeled his work on Western classics

Its antihero, Said Mahran, is an Egyptian Raskolnikov who seeks nobility in robbing and killing. "I am the hope and the dream, the redemption of cowards," he says in one of many interior monologues
Said's story reflects the souring of socialism under Nasser, whose dictatorial rule replaced the monarchy overthrown in 1952.By 1961, Mr. Mahfouz's idealism had vanished or become twisted, as it has in Said
as it has in Said.His giddy dream of redeeming a life of "badly aimed bullets" by punishing the "real robbers" -- the rich "dogs" who prey on the poor -- leads only to the death of innocents, and eventually to his own
Cairo's spirited squalor also has gone gray.Here, the city is dark and laden with symbolism: Said has left his jail cell only to enter the larger prison of Cairo society

We never care about Said or the "hypocrites" he hunts. "The Thief and the Dogs" is a pioneering work, the first stream-of-consciousness novel in Arabic, but it is likely to disappoint Western readers
The 1981 novel "Wedding Song" also is experimental, and another badly aimed bullet.The story of a playwright's stage debut unfolds in first-person monologues, in the manner of Faulkner's "The Sound and the Fury
But the device obscures more than it illuminates.Buried in the work is a meditation on the morality of art, and on the struggle for integrity in an unfair world
But again, the themes get tangled in Mr. Mahfouz's elliptical storytelling.The indirectness of his later work reflects both an appetite for new genres and the hazards of art in the Arab world

Ground zero of the HUD scandal is the Secretary's "discretionary fund," a honey pot used to fund projects that weren't approved through normal HUD channels.Jack Kemp wants to abolish it
Instead, Congress's idea of reform is to increase this slush fund by $28.4 million.And transfer control of much of it to Capitol Hill.The HUD scandals will simply continue, but under new mismanagement
After one of the most amazing debates we've ever seen on the cable channel C-SPAN, the House voted 250 to 170 on Wednesday to order $28.4 million in spending for a New Jersey arts center, a Michigan library and 38 other pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that was supposed to have been so abused during Sam Pierce's tenure.HUD has no paper work whatsoever on 30 of the projects, none of the others has been approved and not a single congressional hearing has been held on any of them
Of course, this kind of blatant congressional pork-barreling is called "constituent service" by Members, while the same kind of noncompetitive favoritism at HUD is labeled "influence peddling." Unlike those awful Republican consultants, Members don't profit directly from HUD projects
Unlike those awful Republican consultants, Members don't profit directly from HUD projects.They merely collect campaign contributions from developers that help keep them in office

In this case, the Members outdid themselves.They transferred some $28 million from the Community Development Block Grant program designated largely for low- and moderate-income projects and funneled it into such items as: -- $1.2 million for a performing-arts center in Newark, -- $1.3 million for "job retention" in Hawaiian sugar mills. -- $400,000 for a collapsing utility tunnel in Salisbury, -- $500,000 for "equipment and landscaping to deter crime and aid police surveillance" at a Michigan park. -- $450,000 for "integrated urban data based in seven cities." No other details. -- $390,000 for a library and recreation center at Mackinac Island, Mich

I welcome the emphasis that is now being put on the drug problem.The efforts to get to the people who are addicted, try to rehabilitate them; if they cannot be rehabilitated, at least to contain them; to educate people, to strongly discourage use of drugs by people who are casual users and first users, to stop this process among the young -- all of these things I think are extremely important
it seems to me that the conceptual base of the current program is flawed and the program is not likely to work.The conceptual base -- a criminal-justice approach -- is the same that I have worked through before, in the Nixon administration when I was budget director and secretary of the treasury with jurisdiction over the Customs

It seems to me we're not really going to get anywhere until we can take the criminality out of the drug business and the incentives for criminality out of it.Frankly, the only way I can think of to accomplish this is to make it possible for addicts to buy drugs at some regulated place at a price that approximates their cost

But trade, one of the economy's main forces in the past few years, showed a sharp deterioration.Imports of goods and services soared, while exports were flat
For the past two years, the foreign trade sector has been a major contributor to economic growth.You can't rely now solely on consumer spending to sustain the economy on a solid growth path
many analysts expect it to slow considerably in the fourth quarter as demand for autos falls.Many economists think the rise in the value of the U.S. dollar this year will further crimp progress in trade
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called the 2.5% pace "good, solid growth," although he said he expects the expansion to slow in the fourth quarter.Inflation is lower than I think people expected it to be, and I think that's good news
But administration officials were concerned over the bleak trade report.Mr. Darby called it a "disappointment
We were unprepared for the deterioration in net exports.it will continue
Some analysts also were disturbed by a pickup in the growth of business inventories.While a buildup of these stocks adds to GNP, it can hurt the economy because a pileup of unsold goods can lead to production cuts and layoffs
According to the report, inventories outside the farm sector grew at an annual rate of $24.6 billion in the third quarter, up from a $19.5 billion pace in the second quarter.Manufacturers' stocks fattened at an $18.4 billion annual rate, up from $8.3 billion
That suggests there is a little more inventory overhang than some people expected.it's anything that's going to cause a downturn in economic activity

ERC International Inc., which provides professional and technical services to the military, is refining its defense niche, not retreating from it.After quadrupling annual earnings over four years to $6.8 million in 1988, the Fairfax, Va., company, posted a 23% drop in earnings for this year's first half
In the belief that development of advanced military technology will remain a top Defense Department priority, ERC last year acquired W.J. Schafer Associates, a technical and scientific analysis company with contracts under the Strategic Defense Initiative.While the SDI anti-missile program recently awarded W.J. Schafer two contracts totaling $13.4 million, ERC's chairman and founder, Jack Aalseth, says he bought the company "more for its technology than its customer
UNC Inc., an Annapolis, Md., contractor that earned $23.8 million on revenue of $400.4 million in 1988, has gone even further in realigning its military business.As orders for its aircraft and submarine parts dwindled, three years of steady growth ended with a 69% drop in income in this year's first half
As orders for its aircraft and submarine parts dwindled, three years of steady growth ended with a 69% drop in income in this year's first half.The company hit on a new strategy: If the Defense Department is so intent on saving money, why not make money off that trend
UNC also is selling new parts, if needed, directly to the military instead of through a prime contractor.At as little as one-third of the government's cost, the company is running a program to train Army helicopter pilots

Some companies are cutting costs and hoping for the best.Telos Corp., a Santa Monica, Calif., provider of software-development and hardware-maintenance services to the military, enjoyed steady growth until this year.Following a tripling of earnings, to $3.9 million, on a doubling of revenue, to $116 million, over four years, earnings in the company's fiscal first quarter, which ended June 30, plunged 90% to $45,000.A one-time write-off for booking nonexistent revenue was partly to blame, but so were lower profits from a stingier contract with the Army and delays in getting paid. Telos responded by combining three of its five divisions to reduce expenses and "bring more focus to potentially fewer bidding opportunities," says Lin Conger, Telos chairman and controlling shareholder

In Japan, he's known in racy weekly magazines as the "King of Shady Money." If nothing else, the 57-year-old's past has its share of dents
Nearly 20 years ago, Mr. Morishita, founder and chairman of Aichi Corp., a finance company, received a 10-month suspended sentence from a Tokyo court for violating a money-lending law and an income tax law.He was convicted of charging interest rates much higher than what the law permitted, and attempting to evade income taxes by using a double accounting system
He's had other brushes with the law.He was arrested on at least three other occasions in the '60s and '70s: for assault and unlawful confinement, for fraud and forgery of private documents, and for extortion
but that it's happy to deal with him. "We like to make our own judgments" about Mr. Morishita
We like to make our own judgments" about Mr. Morishita.People have a different reputation country by country
Mr. Morishita is a leading figure among Japan's 38,000 "machikin," which lend to small companies, and "sarakin," which lend to individuals.Many of these financiers lend freely, often without demanding collateral
Aichi is a machikin, Mr. Utsunomiya says, and "one of the nasty ones." In describing that business in general, he says that when the client can't repay the loan, some machikin "clutch on like hyenas" and even take over the client's company
Last month, Mr. Morishita's new gallery, Aska International Ltd., purchased 6.4% of Christies for #33 million ($53.3 million).Acquired from Carisbrook Holdings U.K. Ltd., a company owned by Australian financier Robert Holmes a Court, the stake was apparently the first of its kind for Aska, an entity separate from Aichi

Settlements reached in the first nine months of 1989 called for wage increases averaging 3.7% in the first contract year and 3.1% annually over the life of the contracts.For all of 1988, union contracts provided for 2.5% wage increases in the first year and 2.4% over the life of the contracts
The figures exclude lump-sum payments and cost-of-living adjustments, so the actual wage increases may have been bigger.About 35% of the workers covered by contracts signed in the first nine months of year get lump-sum payments

An enormous turtle has succeeded where the government has failed: He has made speaking Filipino respectable
who stars in the children's television show "Batibot." He speaks only in Filipino
Batibot has developed into a distinctly Philippine effort.Radio programs and books have followed the daily television show
In the process, "Batibot," an archaic Filipino word meaning "strong" or "enduring," has become a powerful advocate of the use of the Filipino language. "It impresses on ordinary, young Filipinos that there's nothing to feel inferior about in using their own language
When we started the program six years ago, the use of Filipino was deemed unwise by the predominantly middle class.Now it's no longer an issue
The success of "Batibot" stands in marked contrast to many academic and government attempts to promote Filipino as a national language.Filipino -- once known as Pilipino -- is predominantly Tagalog, the Malay-based language spoken in a part of the country's principal island of Luzon
that they are prejudiced against Filipino.For the middle and upper-middle class {Filipino} is declasse
There's also resentment.Other opponents of Filipino come from non-Tagalog regions.They argue that their own languages should have equal weight
Other opponents of Filipino come from non-Tagalog regions.They argue that their own languages should have equal weight
They argue that their own languages should have equal weight, although recent surveys indicate that the majority of the country's population understands Filipino more than any other language. (There are seven major languages and more than 70 dialects in the country
What tongue to speak is an emotional mine field in the Philippines.It is entrenched in the country's colonial bonds to the U.S., in Philippine class structure, in the regional loyalties of its people and in its island geography
It is entrenched in the country's colonial bonds to the U.S., in Philippine class structure, in the regional loyalties of its people and in its island geography.As they did when the Philippines was a colony of the U.S., teachers for the most part teach in English, even though it is a foreign language for most Philippine children
The issue has been simmering for years.It doesn't take much to provoke an intense debate
It doesn't take much to provoke an intense debate.When President Corazon Aquino announced last year that the language would be used in official communications, there was an uproar from many legislators, who continue to conduct debates mostly in English
But many proponents of Filipino see resistance to the language finally crumbling.the media, including "Batibot," have played a crucial role
According to chief scriptwriter Rene Villanueva, "Batibot" doesn't set out to advance the cause of Filipino. "It's not as if we're teaching language per se, We're just using it
as if we're teaching language per se.We're just using it
These days, "Batibot" is produced in a converted lumberyard on a shoestring budget of $3,000 a one-hour segment.It is shown weekdays on two of the country's five networks
But advertising revenue is inadequate.Periodically, there are threats that the program will fold
Batibot" lacks the polish of "Sesame Street." Sound stages echo
Sound stages echo.Acting sometimes falls flat
Acting sometimes falls flat.There are only two large puppets in the program: Pong Pagong and a monkey named Kiko Matsing
And the show's creativity makes up for any technological deficiencies.The program isn't afraid to tackle controversial topics such as nuclear weapons and the environment
Not that the language war is won, even on "Batibot." During one recent episode, all the advertisements were in English

Embedded in the "budget" being concocted by the House-Senate conference committee is something that looks, smells and waddles like a duck.It's a nuisance tax on mergers
Congress has decided to raise $40 million by charging companies $20,000 for the honor of filing the required papers under the Hart-Scott-Rodino law.Ever since the bad days of Big is Bad antitrust enforcement, this law has required that anyone proposing a merger must make a filing describing the effects on all relevant markets
The Hart-Scott filing is then reviewed and any antitrust concerns usually met.Typically, Hart-Scott is used now to give managers of target firms early news of a bid and a chance to use regulatory review as a delaying tactic
but a serious drag on thousands of small, friendly deals.One especially dangerous aspect to the new tax would be that the proceeds will be used to increase the budgets of the antitrust division at Justice and the Federal Trade Commission

he will be urging his allies to boost their stakes in Navigation Mixte, which is being traded in London and is to resume trading in Paris Tuesday.At the same time, he is expected to seek legal and regulatory means of blocking or delaying Paribas's bid.For the moment he has decided against seeking a white knight or organizing a counterbid for Paribas
Navigation Mixte's 1989 unconsolidated, or parent-company, profit is likely to be 4.7 billion francs ($754.4 million), up from 633.8 million francs last year.That is due mostly to payments from Allianz for most of the 50% stake it has agreed to acquire in Navigation Mixte's insurance business
the exceptional gain would mean nearly twice as high a dividend this year as last.If holders avoid tendering to Paribas they can expect strong dividends again next year
Without some unexpected "coup de theatre", I don't see what will block the Paribas bid.Mr. Fournier's biggest hope was to somehow persuade regulatory authorities to block the bid

Once he realized that Paribas's intentions weren't friendly he sought approval to boost his Paribas stake above 10%.but Mr. Fournier downplayed the likelihood of his organizing a takeover bid of his own for the much-larger Paribas
One big question now is the likely role of Mr. Fournier's allies.Mr. Fournier said the large institutions that hold nearly 50% of Navigation Mixte's capital all strongly support him, but some analysts said they aren't so sure
Allianz, for example, has said in official comments so far that it will remain neutral.Paribas is Allianz's lead French bank
Paribas said Monday that it intends to bid to boost its stake in Navigation Mixte to 66.7%, from the 18.7% it already owns.The purchase of the additional 48% stake is expected to cost more than 11 billion francs ($1.77 billion
it will offer 1,850 francs ($296.95) each for Navigation Mixte shares that enjoy full dividend rights, and 1,800 francs each for a block of shares issued July 1, which will receive only partial dividends this year.Alternatively, it is to offer three Paribas shares for one Navigation Mixte share.The Paribas offer values Navigation Mixte at about 23 billion francs, depending on how many of Navigation Mixte's warrants are converted into shares during the takeover battle

Ford managed to show a profit for the quarter primarily because of earnings from overseas auto operations and financial services.A year earlier, Ford reported record net of $856.3 million, or $1.78 a share, on revenue of $20.38 billion
A year earlier, Ford reported record net of $856.3 million, or $1.78 a share, on revenue of $20.38 billion.In the latest nine months, Ford earned $3.52 billion, or $7.51 a share, compared with $4.14 billion, or $8.53 a share
Part of the drop will come from an anticipated charge of as much as $500 million from the proposed sale of its Rouge Steel unit.In the 1988 fourth quarter, Ford had net of $1.16 billion, or $2.42 a share
Its $309 million, or $1.32 a share, gain from the sale of 75 million Mitsubishi shares made net $331 million, or $1.42 a share.Sales were flat at $7.88 billion
Sales were flat at $7.88 billion.The results include record quarterly earnings of $76 million from Chrysler Financial Corp
The results include record quarterly earnings of $76 million from Chrysler Financial Corp.A year earlier, Chrysler's net was $113 million, or 50 cents a share
costs of incentives caused a "moderate" loss in the Highland Park, Mich., company's North American car and truck business.He said the loss wasn't "that much different" from Ford's $37 million loss on U.S. automotive operations
Chrysler "is no longer sure" of its forecast for industry car and truck sales of 14.2 million in the 1990 model year.Consumers are balking at higher prices on 1990 cars
In the nine months, net was $1.02 billion, or $4.38 a share, including the gain from the Mitsubishi stock sale, compared with $617 million, or $2.77 a share, after a charge of $93 million, or 42 cents a share, for plant closings in the 1988 period.Sales rose 8.4% to $27.95 billion from $25.78 billion
But GM's results also illustrate the increasing diversity of its operations.In one breakdown, GM attributed half of its net to its two big technology units, Electronic Data Systems Corp. and GM Hughes Electronics Corp
GM build its cash reserves, exclusive of its financial subsidiary, to $5.5 billion as of Sept. 30, a 22% increase from a year earlier.This cushion could come in handy if GM has to trim fourth-quarter North American production schedules more than the already scheduled 9.5%
Under the circumstances, it won't be easy for GM to exceed its record 1988 fourth-quarter net of $1.4 billion.That means it's unlikely the company will surpass last year's $4.9 billion full-year profit
even though net for the first nine months was up 1.9% to $3.52 billion on revenue of $95.57 billion.It earned $3.46 billion on revenue of $91.21 billion in the 1988 nine months
There are two versions of "Measure for Measure" on stage at the Alley Theater here.One is a strong, vigorous portrayal of Shakespeare's play; the other is director Gregory Boyd's overlay of present-day punk rock decadence on old Vienna
One is a strong, vigorous portrayal of Shakespeare's play; the other is director Gregory Boyd's overlay of present-day punk rock decadence on old Vienna
Measure for Measure" is one of Shakespeare's "problem" plays, so named because it does not fit neatly into a category such as tragedy, comedy or history.Its ambiguity and uneasy mixture of the serious and the comic is no doubt one reason why it is very much in vogue with directors just now
and turns over the rule of the city to the puritanical Angelo.When Angelo hears that the young man Claudio has made his fiancee pregnant before he could marry her, Angelo summarily condemns Claudio to death
featuring a rectangular platform of white-washed boards that extends into the audience.When the action requires, a prison cell, consisting of an enlarged wire cage, rolls forward on iron wheels on the platform
In the play's major scenes Mr. Boyd demonstrates that he has a firm grasp of the Shakespearean dynamic.When Isabella (Ellen Lauren) confronts her brother Claudio (Matt Loney) in his cell, explaining the price she has been asked to secure his freedom; when Isabella and the disguised Duke (Philip Kerr) conspire to trick Angelo; and when Mariana (Annalee Jefferies), a woman wronged by Angelo, confronts him with his past misdeeds, the performers bring the dramatic high points to life with intense energy and intelligence
When, however, he decides to be modern, or more accurately, when he decides to be trendy, the results are far less satisfactory.Mr. Boyd is of the directorial school that believes one must find modern parallels or metaphors to make Shakespeare accessible to today's audiences
Mr. Boyd is of the directorial school that believes one must find modern parallels or metaphors to make Shakespeare accessible to today's audiences.but it puts a heavy burden on the director to show an uncommon degree of imagination and taste
In his "Measure," Mr. Boyd has "modernized" the pimps and prostitutes of Vienna whom Angelo is supposed to bring under control by converting them into transvestites, punk rockers and heavy metal types, with a strong emphasis on leather, chains and porno-inspired costumes.Loud rock music accompanies all the scene changes, even those in the convent
When Claudio is arrested, he is brought on stage nude except for the manacles on his wrists and ankles.When the opportunist Lucio (Jack Stehlin) visits the convent to inform Isabella of her brother's fate, Lucio not only slaps the mother superior on her rear, but brings along a voluptuous companion (Jill Powell), not in Shakespeare's script, to undulate lasciviously
What's more, it represents an important step for the Alley Theater. "Measure for Measure" is Mr. Boyd's first directorial assignment as the theater's new artistic director. He succeeded Pat Brown, who was fired by the Alley board 18 months ago.Her dismissal angered many in the regional theater establishment and led Peter Zeisler, head of Theatre Communications Group, to write an editorial in American Theatre magazine condemning the board.None of this backlash could change the fact that Ms. Brown's regime was remarkably undistinguished and unimaginative

Now the Alley has moved ahead on both artistic and financial fronts.Not only is Mr. Boyd giving the theater a new sense of adventure and excitement on stage, the balance sheet is the best the theater has had in 10 years
the balance sheet is the best the theater has had in 10 years.As opposed to the $1.4 million deficit of the 1987-88 season, the 1988-89 year concluded with a $200,000 surplus and a $500,000 cash reserve
Admittedly last season's runaway hit, "Steel Magnolias," helped a lot, but so did cost cutting and other measures insisted on by the board.Only time will tell if Mr. Boyd can restore to the Alley the acclaim it received when its founder, Nina Vance, was at the height of her powers

Protective barriers will start coming down within the insurance industry next summer, when big industrial companies will be able to buy insurance from carriers in any other EC country for the first time.That's why "we have been working hard to develop a single, more unified presence in Europe," said A.J.C. Smith, Marsh & McLennan's president, at a London news conference yesterday
Analysts speculated that Marsh & McLennan would spend between 250 million marks ($136.4 million) and 350 million marks for the rest of Gradmann & Holler, or roughly 25 to 30 times the private firm's estimated earnings. "This is paying a big price to maintain their virility as the world's leading insurance broker," said Philip Olsen, an analyst at Kitcat & Aitken, a U.K. brokerage firm
Under the proposed combination, Marsh & McLennan would gain a majority stake in Gradmann & Holler that would increase over time to the rest of the remaining 85%.The three managing general partners would receive a "significant" number of Marsh & McLennan shares

modern comedies contain violence, sex and foul language to any greater degree than other recent movies.Older movies have plenty of violence, though it is portrayed in keeping with the more restrictive social conventions of the time
Similarly, one of the most popular comedy genres of the 1930s and '40s was the "murder mystery/ comedy." The "Thin Man" series of movies, as well as many others, based their entire comedic appeal on the star detectives' witty quips and puns as other characters in the movies were murdered
Further, I think Mr. Knight made a poor choice in picking "A Fish Called Wanda" as an example of the deplorable state of modern comedy movies.The specific scene he mentions in which pet dogs are crushed is somewhat reminiscent of the continual plights that befall the coyote in the old Warner Bros.

French President Francois Mitterrand, European Community Commission President Jacques Delors, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and others have begun linking the rapid changes in the East to the need to speed up changes in the West.They are stressing that the best way for the West to help the East is to move faster towards Western European economic and monetary unity
They are stressing that the best way for the West to help the East is to move faster towards Western European economic and monetary unity.This would make the market-oriented system more attractive to Eastern countries, they argue, and allow greater economic aid and technological know-how to flow from West to East
The only response to the challenge being presented to us by the East is to reinforce and accelerate the union and cohesion of the European Community." Mr. Mitterrand proposed that a conference be convened next fall to write a new treaty for the EC allowing a European central bank, and that the treaty be ratified by 1992
that integrating 110 million Eastern Europeans with 320 million Western Europeans is primarily the task of Europeans, despite the U.S.'s obvious strategic and economic interest.The U.S. tends to look at Eastern Europe {not including the Soviet Union} as Europe looks at Latin America: important but far away.But for us in Western Europe, these are Europeans next door
A reintegrated Europe implies big changes in 40-year-old military and economic policies.There is likely to be a natural division of labor with the U.S. more engaged in strategic issues with the Soviet Union, and Western Europe more involved with specific aid measures for the East

He notes that the Marshall Plan of U.S. aid to Europe "didn't just throw money at post-war Europe, it also liberalized and opened up those markets
The French analysis goes further. "Most of the West's leaders have finally concluded that we all want perestroika {Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of economic restructuring} to succeed," says Hubert Vedrine, security adviser to Mr. Mitterrand. "But they haven't yet drawn the operational policy conclusions." He adds that with communism collapsing and Mr. Gorbachev scrambling to rejuvenate the Soviet economy, "Our interest lies in a controlled transformation, a contained nuclear reaction, so we need to help him, and not just with words." Managing change, he adds, will require a lot more aid and a prominent role for the EC, especially in dealing with the question of German reunification

In a move apparently aimed at heading off new punitive legislation, Mr. Deng sent an indirect signal to Washington via T.D. Lee, a Columbia University physicist who met Mr. Deng and other Chinese leaders in Beijing last month.When he met with Mr. Bush on his return he told the president that the Chinese "made statements to me that I regard as a first step toward reconciliation

Given China's far-from-conciliatory statements to its own people, Mr. Bush may be unable to prevent new sanctions.Beijing officials have said they will step up the campaign of arrests and intimidation against those who participated in the demonstrations

One in 1981 raised to $2,000 a year from $1,500 the amount a person could put, tax-deductible, into the tax-deferred accounts and widened coverage to people under employer retirement plans.This caused an explosion of IRA promotions by brokers, banks, mutual funds and others
The measure will create a two-tier exchange rate.Commercial transactions will continue to be based on the official rate of about 0.63 rubles to the dollar.But for Soviet citizens who travel abroad for business or tourism, the rate will jump to 6.26 rubles to the dollar
The current ruble rate has long been out of line with the black market.As Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has opened up the country to foreign trade, the discrepancy has become ever greater
the discrepancy has become ever greater.Western tourists in the Soviet Union who could exchange a dollar -- albeit illegally -- for about four rubles a year ago are now being offered 15 rubles or more
Even at such rates, black marketeers have been able to make big profits because of the dire shortage of consumer goods here.They use dollars to buy Western items such as video recorders and personal computers and then sell them at a huge mark-up
and then sell them at a huge mark-up.The going rate for a small personal computer that costs about $2,000 in the West is anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 rubles
The going rate for a small personal computer that costs about $2,000 in the West is anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 rubles.Even a pack of 20 Western cigarettes can fetch 20 rubles or more
The State Bank's move is part of a drive to iron out exchange-rate discrepancies as Moscow moves toward making the ruble convertible -- a goal that Soviet bankers and economists say is still far away.Rumors of an impending devaluation have been circulating in Moscow for weeks, but the size of the cut took many Western bankers by surprise
but the size of the cut took many Western bankers by surprise. "It's much bigger than we expected," said one German banker
The next step, which could have a larger effect on businesses, will come early next month, when the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs is to hold its first auction of foreign currency.Soviet companies needing Western currencies to buy equipment and supplies abroad will be able to submit bids
Plans for the auction, which was supposed to take place last spring and become a regular event, have been thwarted by a lack of hard currency.Soviet firms that hold some are unwilling to part with it, and joint ventures aren't yet allowed to participate
Unless other rules are changed, the devaluation could cause difficulties for the people it is primarily meant to help: Soviets who travel abroad.Over the past three years, thousands of people here have made use of looser travel restrictions to get their first taste of life abroad. But under current rules, they are allowed to change just 200 rubles into dollars and other currencies for each trip.At the new rate, that would give them about $30 to travel on

Kodak, based in Rochester, N.Y., said IBM also had bid for the business.IBM is based in Armonk, N.Y
The loss is a setback to IBM, which pointed to the Kodak contract as an example of its success in systems integration.That's an emerging business in which computer makers or consultants provide turnkey communications and computing services to major corporations
A Kodak spokesman declined to disclose the potential value of the contract.He said that American Telephone & Telegraph, MCI Communications Corp., Rochester Telephone Corp. and IBM itself would likely be Digital's subcontractors on the project

"That's why we went with IBM for data center management . . . and now Digital for voice and data telecommunications
it's time to take a fresh look at the nation's central bank.After 75 years there may be a few things that are worth reexamining
The regional Federal Reserve Bank setup, for instance, may be out of date.In earlier years it may have seemed reasonable to give Richmond, Va., a bank and allow Los Angeles only a branch of the San Francisco bank, but times have changed
In earlier years it may have seemed reasonable to give Richmond, Va., a bank and allow Los Angeles only a branch of the San Francisco bank, but times have changed.Maybe the whole regional system is an anachronism
to restore an arrangement we once had -- or, at least, part of it.In the beginning, the treasury secretary and the comptroller of the currency were both ex officio members of the Federal Reserve Board.But in 1935, when Congress was trying to find someone or something to blame for the Great Depression, it decided to drop both the secretary and the comptroller from the board Rep. Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.) has introduced a bill in Congress, co-sponsored by Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.), that would put the treasury secretary back on the board
Carter Glass, a former treasury secretary who was then back in Congress, probably influenced the decision.He said that when he was on the board he felt that he had a great deal of power and, somehow, he didn't think that was a good thing
Times have changed.Rep. Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.) has introduced a bill in Congress, co-sponsored by Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.), that would put the treasury secretary back on the board
that would put the treasury secretary back on the board.There is doubt that the change would accomplish much
There is doubt that the change would accomplish much but at least Congress, as in 1935, would be doing something.So far no one has suggested putting the comptroller back on the board
Nicholas Brady, the incumbent treasury secretary, is of course aware of the proposal, and he doesn't like it much.Mr. Dorgen has changed tactics, dropping the seat-for-the-secretary idea
Mr. Dorgen has changed tactics, dropping the seat-for-the-secretary idea.That may have pleased the secretary, but H. Erich Heinemann, chief economist of the investment firm of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co., suggests that Mr. Brady may figure he already has all the power he needs
He was, in fact, taking an especially keen interest in board matters even before he went to the treasury.After the October 1987 market crash, Mr. Brady as a private citizen headed a presidential commission that tried to decide what went wrong and what should be done about it.One of the commission's recommendations was that a single agency, probably the Federal Reserve, should coordinate regulation of all financial markets

but so far Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan hasn't made a pitch for the job.The Fed has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in 1987 and again in 1989 it appears to have handled them well
The Fed has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in 1987 and again in 1989 it appears to have handled them well.he thought government agencies in the latest market drop were better prepared to coordinate their actions
In recent weeks, moreover, Mr. Brady has joined other administration officials in trying to urge the Fed toward lower interest rates.The urging admittedly has been gentle
The urging admittedly has been gentle.In an interview with the Washington Post in early October, the secretary said the Fed may be slightly more interested in curbing inflation than the administration is, while the administration may put slightly more emphasis on spurring economic growth
At least some economists, of course, would argue that inflation deserves a lot of emphasis.Earlier this month the St. Louis Fed held a conference to assess the system's first 75 years.Allan Meltzer, a Carnegie-Mellon University economist, noted that the Fed's record included the longest, most sustained, peacetime inflation in our history, dating from either 1966 or 1967 to 1989

Allan Meltzer, a Carnegie-Mellon University economist, noted that the Fed's record included the longest, most sustained, peacetime inflation in our history, dating from either 1966 or 1967 to 1989.The inflation-growth argument is an old one, but Mr. Brady, on the board or off, is surely trying to influence Fed policy
Equally importantly, the treasury secretary has spearheaded the administration effort to bring the U.S. dollar down by shopping avidly for West German marks and Japanese yen.The treasury can do something on its own, but to have any hope of success it needs help from the Fed
but to have any hope of success it needs help from the Fed.The central bank has been helping
Now, sterilized intervention may have some effect.When traders see the Fed is in the exchange market it may make them tread a little carefully, for fear of what the central bank may do
But it's generally accepted that sterilized intervention has little or no lasting impact on currency values.After August the Fed may have stopped sterilizing, but it's hard to see much impact on the dollar
but it's hard to see much impact on the dollar.The dollar is still highly volatile
The dollar is still highly volatile.The Fed has let interest rates slip slightly, but whether the main reason was dollar intervention, the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment, or the Friday 13 market drop, only Mr. Greenspan and his associates know
that a government that wants steady, stable exchange rates might try some steady stable economic policies.Trying to manage exchange rates to some desired level would mean diverting monetary and fiscal policies from their customary roles and thereby risking excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation
It has also been a week when inside-the-beltway Washington has had a high old time gnawing over ex-President Reagan's multimillion-dollar junket in Japan.The latter may seem oddly irrelevant, if not downright trivial, given the big picture and the way we have handled it in the nation's capital has done nothing to dispel that impression
In fact, however, Mr. Reagan's casual debasement of the office he so recently held raises issues about which Americans can actually do something.Our ability to influence the outcome of events in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is far more marginal
Those events continue to move at a rate, and in a direction, which leave informed commentary -- let alone policy -- far in their wake.that the U.S.S.R. ignored universal human values by invading Afghanistan and, to put it bluntly, "engaged in a violation of the ABM Treaty" by building its radar station at Krasnoyarsk

Shevardnadze confessed that the U.S.S.R. ignored universal human values by invading Afghanistan and, to put it bluntly, "engaged in a violation of the ABM Treaty" by building its radar station at Krasnoyarsk.Hungary is no longer a "Socialist Peoples" republic
that the U.S.S.R. ignored universal human values by invading Afghanistan and, to put it bluntly, "engaged in a violation of the ABM Treaty" by building its radar station at Krasnoyarsk.Hungary is no longer a "Socialist Peoples" republic, the Communist Party no longer has automatic delegates in the U.S.S.R.'s Congress of Peoples Deputies and Egon Krenz was not backed unanimously by his fellow party functionaries when he took over as East Germany's new maximum leader.All of that is just for starters, or so the hundreds of thousands of Eastern Europeans in the streets seem to hope and are certainly demanding
For journalists, however, who write what they fondly view as history's first draft, this has also been a week to give a lot of space and time to Ron and Nancy's sales appearance in Japan on behalf of a communications giant and its controversial founder.It has been a well-paid transaction, this bartering away of the prestige of the republic's highest office
It has been a well-paid transaction, this bartering away of the prestige of the republic's highest office.The Japanese industrialist has coughed up at least $2 million, the Japanese government has put up just about as much, or so it is reported and at least one estimate puts the total tab at $7 million

as it is a reflection of the disintegration of public standards.The theme song for the 1980s has been, "Anything Goes," and it has been whistled with gusto from Wall Street to some of the highest peaks of televangelism
that this is nothing new, that America has always suffered from a bad case of schizophrenia when it comes to the dichotomy between what is professed and what is practiced.There is evidence to support that view
There is evidence to support that view.Eighty-three years ago, William James wrote to H.G. Wells: "The moral flabbiness born of the exclusive worship of the bitch goddess success . . . that, with the squalid cash interpretation put on the word success, is our national disease." But if it was the national disease in 1906, it is today the national commonplace.If there is no law against it, do it.If the law leaves loopholes, use them.If there is no moral prohibition that expressly forbids it, full speed ahead.And if you are caught or if people complain, simply argue that "everyone does it" or "no one said I shouldn't " and brazen it out.As a last recourse, when all else has failed and you are pinned, apologize for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong. (See, for instance, Jim Bakker's remarks upon being sentenced to prison this Tuesday for defrauding the faithful.) Consider the troubling dissonance between Mr. Shevardnadze's speech of confession this week and the hang-tough defense of everyone concerned with the Iran-Contra affair.The Soviet foreign minister publicly concedes that his government "violated norms of behavior" in Afghanistan and just plain lied about the radar station.We have people in high place still lying through their teeth about Iran-Contra, and that apparently isn't going to change.For that matter, those long ago identified as liars are still given respectful hearings in the press

That is the key to the current "national disease." No one seems willing to hold anyone in public life to a standard higher than the narrowest construction of the law
to hold anyone in public life to a standard higher than the narrowest construction of the law.the general inclination is to offer a version of the old refrain, "Who am I to judge
You are mad because he's making so much money," say President Reagan's defenders.No, we ought to be mad because he has demeaned the office we gave him, enlisting it in the service of private gain, just as we ought to be mad that public officials lie through their teeth, play disingenuous games about their activities or, to steal a phrase, make public service a private trough
I'm not going to be stampeded into overreacting to any of this, President Bush told Mr. Apple in this week's interview.He was referring to the "absolutely extraordinary" events in Eastern Europe, and it is a defensible position
But there is no defense at all for the ethos of the 1980s.We didn't stampede into it, we slithered and slipped down the long slope

Hoechst AG's Chairman Wolfgang Hilger said the company wants to have a substitute product to completely replace ozone-damaging chlorofluorocarbons by 1995.In April, Hoechst, the largest producer of CFCs in West Germany, said it wanted to reduce production of the product by 50% by 1993
Mr. Hilger said Hoechst will invest 50 million marks ($27.2 million) in a plant to make a substitute product it has developed that it says is unchlorinated.The company hopes the new plant, likely to be built in Frankfurt, will be able to produce 10,000 tons a year

The U.S., in a far-reaching plan submitted to the Geneva meeting Tuesday, proposed curbing price support subsidies within 10 years and eliminating export subsidies within five years.the plan was flexible, and was intended as a pragmatic approach for gradually removing trade-distorting subsidies
But the EC reacted defiantly, arguing that the proposal's main aim is to destroy the Common Agricultural Policy, the EC's $28 billion-a-year price support program. "The American proposal is not an adequate basis for negotiation," the EC said in a statement
and is insisting on the "elimination" of export subsides, not just reduction.the U.S. plan "calls into question" the agreement reached by world negotiators last April in Geneva seeking "substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and protection
U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Jules Katz replied that the proposal was entirely consistent with the April accord.He said he was surprised by the EC's reaction, calling it "vehement, even frenetic
The U.S. proposal also was criticized by food-importing developing countries.While many experts argue that food-importing nations would eventually become self-sufficient in a free-market system, the poorest nations are likely to need help in the meantime
its plan would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when the free-trade goals would be achieved.that its plan would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by converting certain non-tariff barriers into tariffs that, together with existing tariffs, then would be phased out over 10 years
The new U.S. package also says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports.It would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and sanitation rules to impede trade arbitrarily
Bell Atlantic Corp. said it agreed definitively to acquire one of Control Data Corp. 's computer-maintenance businesses.Terms of the accord weren't disclosed
Control Data's third-party maintenance unit services products primarily made by Digital Equipment Corp. and International Business Machines Corp.The unit has 6,000 customers and, according to one analyst, had 1988 revenue of about $85 million
The unit represents a small portion of Minneapolis-based Control Data's overall computer-servicing business, which last year posted sales of about $400 million.Earlier this year, the company sold a similar unit in Europe for about $25 million
Two recent decisions by federal courts cast judges in the odd role of telling authors how they should write history and biography.These decisions deserve more attention than they have received from scholars, and from journalists as well
Russell Miller's "Bare-Faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard" is a biography of the founder of the Church of Scientology.Mr. Hubbard, who died in 1986, bequeathed the copyrights on his writings to his church, which licensed them to New Era Publications, a Danish corporation
Russell Miller's "Bare-Faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard" is a biography of the founder of the Church of Scientology.Mr. Hubbard, who died in 1986, bequeathed the copyrights on his writings to his church, which licensed them to New Era Publications, a Danish corporation.In 1988 New Era sought a permanent injunction to restrain Henry Holt & Co. from publishing "Bare-Faced Messiah" on the ground that Mr. Miller's quotations from Mr. Hubbard infringed the copyrights
In 1988 New Era sought a permanent injunction to restrain Henry Holt & Co. from publishing "Bare-Faced Messiah" on the ground that Mr. Miller's quotations from Mr. Hubbard infringed the copyrights.The publisher argued in response that the "fair use" statute permits quotation "for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, . . . scholarship, or research
District Court Judge Pierre Leval denied the injunction on the ground that New Era had failed to make its claim within a reasonable time -- the doctrine lawyers call "laches." As for the merits, Judge Leval said that Mr. Miller had written "a serious book of responsible historical criticism
As for the merits, Judge Leval said that Mr. Miller had written "a serious book of responsible historical criticism." Verbatim quotation, the judge believed, was justified in order to prove points the author had asserted about Mr. Hubbard -- mendacity, bigotry, paranoia and other unlovely traits that could not be persuasively demonstrated without use of Mr. Hubbard's own words
Verbatim quotation, the judge believed, was justified in order to prove points the author had asserted about Mr. Hubbard -- mendacity, bigotry, paranoia and other unlovely traits that could not be persuasively demonstrated without use of Mr. Hubbard's own words. "The biographer/critic should not be required simply to express . . . conclusions without defending them by example
The biographer/critic should not be required simply to express . . . conclusions without defending them by example." In such circumstances, free-speech interests outweighed the interests of the copyright owner
But Judge Leval felt constrained by an earlier decision of the Second Circuit Court forbidding a biographer of J.D. Salinger to quote from Mr. Salinger's personal letters.He distinguished the two cases
He distinguished the two cases: In Salinger, Judge Leval noted, the quotations were for the purpose of enlivening the biography rather than of proving points about the subject
Still the Salinger decision created a strong presumption against fair use of unpublished materials.that a few of Mr. Miller's quotations from Mr. Hubbard's unpublished writings, because they were not necessary to prove historical points, failed the fair-use test and therefore infringed copyright
The case went on appeal to the Second Circuit.In a decision in April of this year, Judge Roger Miner, joined by Judge Frank Altimari, agreed on denying the injunction and did not doubt that "Bare-Faced Messiah" was a serious work but rejected Judge Leval's argument that the public interest in scholarship could outweigh the sanctity of copyright
but rejected Judge Leval's argument that the public interest in scholarship could outweigh the sanctity of copyright. "We conclude," the two judges wrote, "that laches is the sole bar to the issuance of an injunction." Had the suit been filed in time, they said, "Bare-Faced Messiah" would have been suppressed
that laches is the sole bar to the issuance of an injunction." Had the suit been filed in time Bare-Faced Messiah" would have been suppressed
This was too much for James Oakes, the court's chief judge.In a powerful separate opinion, Judge Oakes further distinguished the Salinger case by pointing out that a living person, like Mr. Salinger, had privacy rights that did not apply to a dead man, like Mr. Hubbard
that a living person, like Mr. Salinger, had privacy rights that did not apply to a dead man, like Mr. Hubbard.that Salinger might by being taken in another factual context come back to haunt us
I thought that Salinger might by being taken in another factual context come back to haunt us.This case realizes that concern
Judges Oakes and Leval understand the requirements of historical scholarship.Judges Miner and Altimari do not appear to have a clue
Yet at the moment they are the judges who are making the law.As matters stand, the Salinger ruling, torn from context and broadly construed, is controlling
As matters stand, the Salinger ruling, torn from context and broadly construed, is controlling.If an author quotes "more than minimal amounts" of unpublished copyrighted materials, as the Salinger decision had it, "he deserves to be enjoined." The courts have not defined "minimal amounts," but publishers, I understand, take it to mean about 50 words

The "Bare-Faced Messiah" decision strikes a blow against the whole historical enterprise.A second decision, handed down in August by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is another blow against scholarship
A second decision, handed down in August by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, is another blow against scholarship.Janet Malcolm, a professional writer on psychiatric matters, wrote a series of articles for the New Yorker, later published in book form by Knopf under the title "In the Freud Archives
Janet Malcolm, a professional writer on psychiatric matters, wrote a series of articles for the New Yorker, later published in book form by Knopf under the title "In the Freud Archives." The articles were largely based on interviews Ms. Malcolm had taped with Jeffrey Masson, a psychoanalyst who had served as projects director of the Freud Archives
Mr. Masson then brought a libel suit against Ms. Malcolm, the New Yorker and Knopf.As a public figure, Mr. Masson had to prove malice and, as proof of malice, Mr. Masson contended that defamatory quotations ascribed to him by Ms. Malcolm were in fact fabricated
and, as proof of malice, Mr. Masson contended that defamatory quotations ascribed to him by Ms. Malcolm were in fact fabricated.The quotes could not be found on the tapes
that when a writer uses quotation marks in reporting what someone has said, the reader assumes that these are the speaker's precise words or at least his words purged of "uh" and "you know" and grammatical error.While judges have an obligation under the First Amendment to safeguard freedom of the press, "the right to deliberately alter quotations is not, in my view, a concomitant of a free press
Ms. Malcolm, for example, wrote that Mr. Masson described himself as "the greatest analyst who ever lived." No such statement appears on the tapes
No such statement appears on the tapes.The majority cited Mr. Masson's remark "It's me alone . . . against the rest of the analytic world" as warrant for the Malcolm fabrication
Ms. Malcolm had Mr. Masson describing himself as "an intellectual gigolo." Again, no such statement appears on the tapes
Again, no such statement appears on the tapes.The majority decision contended that the phrase was a rational interpretation of Mr. Masson's description of himself as a "private asset but a public liability" to Anna Freud
The majority decision contended that the phrase was a rational interpretation of Mr. Masson's description of himself as a "private asset but a public liability" to Anna Freud and that in any case it was not defamatory.Judge Kozinski found the derivation entirely strained and writes that "for an academic to refer to himself as an intellectual gigolo is . . . a devastating admission of professional dishonesty
These were only two of a series of fabrications that had, in Judge Kozinski's words, the cumulative effect of making Mr. Masson "appear more arrogant, less sensitive, shallower, more self-aggrandizing, and less in touch with reality than he appears from his own statements." As Robert Coles wrote in a review of Ms. Malcolm's book, Mr. Masson emerges "as a grandiose egotist . . . and, in the end, a self-destructive fool.But it is not Janet Malcolm who calls him such: his own words reveal this psychological profile
who calls him such: his own words reveal this psychological profile
his own words reveal this psychological profile." We now know that the words were not always his own
There is one sacred rule of journalism.The writer must not invent
The writer must not invent." Should the green light Judges Alarcon and Hall have given to the fabrication of quotations become standard practice, it will notably reduce the value of journalism for historians -- and for citizens

Legal controversies in America have a way of assuming a symbolic significance far exceeding what is involved in the particular case.They speak volumes about the state of our society at a given moment
It has always been so.In the 1920s, a young schoolteacher, John T. Scopes, volunteered to be a guinea pig in a test case sponsored by the American Civil Liberties Union to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution imposed by the Tennessee Legislature.The result was a world-famous trial exposing profound cultural conflicts in American life between the "smart set," whose spokesman was H.L. Mencken, and the religious fundamentalists, whom Mencken derided as benighted primitives.Few now recall the actual outcome: Scopes was convicted and fined $100, and his conviction was reversed on appeal because the fine was excessive under Tennessee law

when Alger Hiss became a lightning rod for the anxieties of the Cold War and conflicting attitudes toward the New Deal he had served.His trials aroused public passions out of all proportion to the rather banal secrets he allegedly had passed to Soviet intelligence
And so it seems to be with the case of Elizabeth Morgan, the Washington, D.C., plastic surgeon jailed in a child custody case for refusing to reveal the whereabouts of her daughter.Dr. Morgan has just emerged from the D.C. jail after more than two years' confinement for contempt of court, a heroine to her many supporters
To the rest of us, the case is a puzzle.It is what lawyers call "fact intensive
It is what lawyers call "fact intensive." It presents no great issue of legal principle, no overriding question of family law or the law of contempt
Instead, it turns on the disputed and elusive facts of "who did what to whom." It is difficult, if not impossible, for anyone who has not pored over the thousands of pages of court pleadings and transcripts to have a worthwhile opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy
It is difficult, if not impossible, for anyone who has not pored over the thousands of pages of court pleadings and transcripts to have a worthwhile opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy.Certainly I do not
So we must look elsewhere for an explanation of the unusual power this case has exerted over the minds of many, not just in Washington but elsewhere in the country and even the world.I suggest that three themes have come together in the strange case of Dr. Morgan
many of Dr. Morgan's supporters have taken Thurber's memorable title "The Male Animal" quite literally.The vehemence of the emotions aroused by the case testifies to its symbolic importance in the war that Thurber accepted as an eternal part of the human condition
A second theme is the undercurrent of social class and race in the public reaction to the Morgan case.Dr. Morgan is a highly educated white professional who attended some of the "best" schools
Dr. Morgan is a highly educated white professional who attended some of the "best" schools.As members of the Black Caucus in Congress asked during the debate on the legislation that freed Dr. Morgan, does anyone seriously believe that if she were an uneducated, black, working-class woman, Congress would have rushed to pass a private relief bill freeing her
Finally, the case of Dr. Morgan gave Congress an opportunity to act with unaccustomed decisiveness and to engage in one of its favorite pastimes -- bashing the District of Columbia government.The local government is discredited in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons
The local government is discredited in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons.Bashing the D.C. government is risk-free for members of Congress
The Morgan case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex, class, race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of Dr. Morgan's particular situation.It may stand as a metaphor for how wide and deep the divisions in that society continue to be however we try to deny their existence

Richard Breeden hadn't noticed that his new desk had just four telephone lines and one phone.It was, after all, only his second full day as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission
But the lack of lines became painfully apparent.As the stock market lurched into a 190-point free fall on Oct. 13, Mr. Breeden found himself scurrying around the sixth floor of the SEC -- from his desk, where the New York Stock Exchange was on an open line, to his assistant's office, where the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was connected, to a third room, where a computer monitored market moves
As the stock market lurched into a 190-point free fall on Oct. 13, Mr. Breeden found himself scurrying around the sixth floor of the SEC -- from his desk, where the New York Stock Exchange was on an open line, to his assistant's office, where the Commodity Futures Trading Commission was connected, to a third room, where a computer monitored market moves.I'd either have to disconnect the New York Stock Exchange or go out to the secretary's desk
It won't happen again.Now there are more lines connected to the chairman's office, and the market-monitoring computer has been moved next to his desk
Now there are more lines connected to the chairman's office, and the market-monitoring computer has been moved next to his desk.It's all part of a new "command center
The changes in the office layout illustrate Mr. Breeden's stance as the nation's top securities regulator.Like his predecessor, David Ruder, he was faced with a crisis in the stock markets soon after coming into office
In an interview and in congressional testimony, he repeatedly points to the recent 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average -- the second-largest ever -- as evidence of the need for Congress to give the SEC the ability to better monitor leveraged buy-out loan activity by brokerage firms and to track big trades in the market.A veteran of another financial crisis, the savings-and-loan bailout, Mr. Breeden wants to have the SEC regulate securities issued by banks and S&Ls
More broadly, he wants to "modernize" regulation by eliminating barriers between commercial and investment banking and by helping U.S. financial firms compete in the global market.He believes the tax code encourages the use of debt instead of stock and may fuel leveraged buy-outs, an area the SEC doesn't regulate directly but one where it wields influence both on Wall Street and in Congress
Also unlike Mr. Ruder, Mr. Breeden appears to be in a position to get somewhere with his agenda.As a former White House aide who worked closely with Congress, he is savvy in the ways of Washington
For instance, he hasn't stated a clear position on high-risk, high-yield junk bonds, an area of growing concern as turmoil in the junk market spills over into stocks.He may be waiting to see the results of several pending SEC studies of junk market liquidity and disclosure rules
He also has kept a close wrap on the names of people under consideration for the crucial post of enforcement director at the commission, a job vacant since the summer.Mr. Breeden's selection will be scrutinized as an important signal about the strength of his commitment to continuing the SEC's high-profile pursuit of insider trading and market manipulation on Wall Street
Congress seems likely to let the new chairman have his way for a while.Members of the Senate Banking Committee know Mr. Breeden from working on the thrift-bailout bill, and the relationship generally remains warm
These days, Mr. Breeden is winning praise in Washington and on Wall Street for his behind-the-scenes role in monitoring the Friday-the-13th market plunge and the following Monday's harrowing morning session.As a regulator charged with restoring investor confidence, Mr. Breeden avoided making market-jarring comments and worked to gather information critical to Wall Street and to other government agencies
Not everyone has jumped on the Breeden bandwagon, however.Some in Washington contend that it's too soon to tell whether Mr. Breeden will help or hinder the SEC
Some in Washington contend that it's too soon to tell whether Mr. Breeden will help or hinder the SEC. "I don't think this was a real test It was a fairly stressful weekend, but my sense is if you hadn't had Richard Breeden there, it wouldn't have made much of a difference
I don't think this was a real test.It was a fairly stressful weekend, but my sense is if you hadn't had Richard Breeden there, it wouldn't have made much of a difference
an agency that covets its independence, Mr. Breeden may be too much of a Washington insider.They note that he has adorned his office with five photos of George Bush, one of them featuring the First Dog, Millie
that he has adorned his office with five photos of George Bush, one of them featuring the First Dog, Millie.They worry that Mr. Breeden also will roll over when told to do so by the White House
But Mr. Breeden already has shown an eagerness to run the SEC his way.During the Monday market rebound, a New York exchange spokesman told Cable News Network viewers that the industrial average had turned down 70 points.Stunned, Mr. Breeden turned to his market-monitoring computer, which by then was next to his desk.It showed the DJIA up 30 points. SEC staffers soon determined that a widely watched stock-market service, Quotron, had miscalculated the industrial average.Mr. Breeden instructed SEC staffers to inform the network that it was airing the wrong number. "It was the plunge that didn't happen," he says

Mr. Breeden also is trying to use a far more catastrophic event -- the California earthquake -- to move another rule change past Congress.That disaster closed the Pacific Stock Exchange's stock options-trading operation, forcing those options to be switched to other exchanges temporarily
Congressmen raised the issue yesterday at a hearing.Mr. Breeden, not missing a chance to press his agenda, cited the earthquake

The do-it-yourself show, slated to start airing by June 1990, marks Sears's entry into the burgeoning market of home repair television programs and could bolster sales of its home improvement products.In recent months, sales of home improvement items have sagged, along with sales of other big ticket durable goods
The show also signals Mr. Vila's return as a television celebrity.Earlier this year, public television station WGBH in Boston fired Mr. Vila after a sponsor protested some of his numerous commercial endorsements
I'm ecstatic about the change," said Mr. Vila.In an interview, Mr. Vila criticized his old show, which is continuing with a new host

The proposed changes, which are scheduled to be announced today, would apply to pesticides and other substances found on fresh and processed foods, according to federal officials.Environmental groups have been calling for faster action on dangerous pesticides and may welcome part of the proposal
But they are already objecting to, among other things, a plan to give more weight to cost-benefit considerations in evaluating pesticides."It's a tremendous disappointment," said Janet Hathaway, an attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council. "Allowing the EPA to condone continued use of a chemical whenever the benefits outweigh the risks is absolutely anathema to the environmental community
It's a tremendous disappointment.Allowing the EPA to condone continued use of a chemical whenever the benefits outweigh the risks is absolutely anathema to the environmental community
The Bush administration plans to announce a series of principles and to work with congressional leaders in writing specific legislative proposals that embody them.The principles would give the Environmental Protection Agency increased authority and flexibility in regulating pesticides, with the aim of enabling the agency to move more quickly
The principles would give the Environmental Protection Agency increased authority and flexibility in regulating pesticides, with the aim of enabling the agency to move more quickly.There already are proposals pending in Congress to overhaul pesticide law
when the EPA was harshly criticized for failing to yank the possible carcinogen, a growth regulator used to make apples redder and crunchier.The agency has since acted to remove Alar from the nation's grocery shelves by May 31, 1991, and the apple industry has said that growers already have stopped using the chemical
In addition, the principles attempt to eliminate the so-called Delaney Paradox.Under the Delaney clause, which applies to processed food, a chemical is banned if it causes cancer in laboratory animals.Under other laws applying to pesticide use, however, that same chemical could be allowed to be used on fresh food if it fell within the EPA's tolerance level
to set "negligible risk" levels for pesticide residues in processed food.Chemicals that exceed these risk levels would be barred, but those that fall below these levels would be allowed

Three new books make the point that one large price of the glittery college-sports show can be the integrity of the schools that stage it.They are: "A Payroll to Meet: A Story of Greed, Corruption and Football at SMU" (Macmillan, 221 pages, $18.95) by David Whitford; "Big Red Confidential: Inside Nebraska Football" (Contemporary, 231 pages, $17.95) by Armen Keteyian; and "Never Too Young to Die: The Death of Len Bias" (Pantheon, 252 pages, $18.95) by Lewis Cole

The man who brought the bribe to the Dallas school was Ron Meyer, a flashy sort who came in 1975 to rescue a woebegone program, Mr. Whitford writes.Mr. Meyer's personal style was illustrated by his pinning a $100 bill to a high-school bulletin board on which other coaches tacked their cards

It involved the athletics director, two different football coaching staffs, and school trustees and governors -- just about everybody, it seemed, but Donald Shields, the university's president.There's a memorable passage in which Mr. Shields, having finally learned of the practice, expresses his outrage to Bill Clements, then a university governor (and now the governor of Texas!) and oil man Edwin Cox, chairman of the board of trustees
You stay out of it.Go run the university
Mr. Whitford drew on voluminous news media coverage of the SMU scandal, and on a university internal investigation.Mr. Keteyian had to do most of his own digging on University of Nebraska football, which is, to date, high and dry as far as the NCAA is concerned

There are gratuitous references to supposed romantic liaisons between Husker players and a low-level female university employee.A serious charge -- that star flanker Irving Fryar "threw" the 1984 Orange Bowl game by intentionally dropping a pass in the end zone -- is included, even though the Nebraska assistant coach quoted denied making it

that he used 'em other Huskers did too.It's a mystery how this could have escaped the notice of Nebraska coaches

Never Too Young" is a different sort of work, focusing on the 1986 death from cocaine ingestion of Bias, a University of Maryland basketball star ticketed for sure pro stardom.While the university was no more to blame for that than for the similar fate of any other student, it must bear responsibility for its conduct in the aftermath
Bias's coach, Lefty Driesell, ordered the room in which Bias died to be cleaned before the police could arrive and the school's athletics director issued false information about the academic standing of Bias and other players.Those, of course, were the responses of people with something to hide

In addition to the forecast, the company also said it is examining potential cost cuts and reductions in overhead.The spokeswoman said the exchange would resume trading of Delmed stock today
Delmed, which makes and sells peritoneal dialysis products used in treating kidney disease, on Tuesday announced the resignations of Robert S. Ehrlich, chairman, president and chief executive officer, and of Leslie I. Shapiro, chief operating officer and chief financial officer.They were succeeded by executives of Fresenius USA Inc. and its parent, Fresenius AG, which owns about 45% of Delmed
sales of Delmed products through the exclusive arrangement with National Medical accounted for 87% of Delmed's 1988 sales of $21.1 million.The current distribution arrangement ends in March 1990, although Delmed said it will continue to provide some supplies of the peritoneal dialysis products to National Medical

But July 5, a thunderstorm in Wilmington, Del., caused Shellpot Creek to rise 15 feet, pouring 1.3 million gallons of water into basement vaults.The water destroyed about $75 million in currency and caked $4 million of coins with mud, rendering them dangerous to counting machines
We kind of got caught between bureaucracies.The U.S. Mint wouldn't take the coin because it wasn't mutilated, and the Federal Reserve Bank accepts only clean coins
it is merely an "agent" for coins, responsible only for storage and distribution. "We issue paper money; we destroy paper money

For eight hours a day for the past two weeks, in aggregates of as much as 27,000 pounds (equaling $20,000 in pennies), Coin Wrap has been pouring money into a cement-mixing truck.A giant heater, working like a blowtorch, causes the mud to crust and burns off any wrappers
A giant heater, working like a blowtorch, causes the mud to crust and burns off any wrappers.After clanging around for an hour or so, the shiny, hot money pours out of the cement chute, where a giant vacuum sucks away the dried mud and burnt wrappers
In fact, there's only one person involved who's happy, and that's Floyd String, president of Coin Wrap and conceiver of the cement-truck solution.Not only did his company find $20,000 worth of work, but when the approach was suggested Brooks officials "didn't laugh at me or anything
Parenthood," this summer's successful and amusing movie about parents and children, apparently was only the beginning.It seems that every day a new movie opens featuring a child coping with a mother's death, or adoption, or aging parents, or pregnancy
Some of our best and most idiosyncratic film makers -- from Truffaut to Fellini to Woody Allen -- have taken a cue from Chekhov: When it comes to compelling drama, there's no place like home
that the drama played out in every home will be interesting to people who live somewhere else.This is not the case
This is not the case.Some diaries simply aren't worth snooping in
Yet there will be people who will sob at "Immediate Family," a limply constructed and offensive movie about adoption.These are the sensitive souls who can empathize with and even enjoy hearing about other people's troubles, no matter how haltingly or predictably the sad tale is told
Immediate Family" takes the position that only rich people living in nice houses should have children.The film makers have couched this offensive idea in pretty packaging
The film makers have couched this offensive idea in pretty packaging.Everyone is very nice and good-looking -- the adoptive parents (Glenn Close and James Woods) and the teen-age couple who decide to give up their baby for adoption (Mary Stuart Masterson and Kevin Dillon
Linda and Michael (Ms.Close and Mr. Woods), who seem to be pushing 40, live in a large and tastefully decorated home in suburban Seattle.All of their friends have children and they can't, so now they want a child more than anything -- perhaps even more than Michael wanted his fancy convertible or his deluxe stereo equipment
Having exhausted all modern aids to fertility, Linda and Michael decide to adopt.The actors wear pained expressions to indicate their genuine longing for a little one
Or maybe they are disgusted by the literal-minded musical score; when a character arrives at a major decision her thoughts are revealed by the sound of "I Can See Clearly Now
The adoption agency insists on introducing the adopting parents to the birth mother, so Linda and Michael pay for pregnant Lucy's (Ms.Masterson) bus ticket from Ohio. (Why in these movies is the unwed pregnant woman always from Ohio?I ask this not necessarily as a native Ohioan.) Lucy, of course, is pretty and smart, though uneducated
Lucy, of course, is pretty and smart, though uneducated.Everyone falls in love with everyone else
Everyone falls in love with everyone else.There is some pain, when Lucy has the baby and "didn't know she would feel like this" and wants to keep the baby
But in the end, everything turns out for the best, in the film makers' warped view.Like lawyers in the hostile takeover field, the baby goes where the money is
At the other end of the life cycle is "Dad," Gary David Goldberg's adaptation of the William Wharton novel.This picture is about a middle-aged son who makes sure that his delayed bond with his father will last by waiting to cement it until just before the old man dies
The glib emotional style Mr. Goldberg has perfected on television's "Family Ties" doesn't benefit from magnification.His characters practically scamper through a vast range of human emotions, like travelers doing 10 cities in eight days
His characters practically scamper through a vast range of human emotions, like travelers doing 10 cities in eight days.They pause only to register little whimpers of distress and sighs of satisfaction, like tourists cataloging the sights they've seen from the window of a bus
But by comparison, this fluffy comedy seems like a gem.It starts with conception, taking the sperm's point of view, then progresses to the baby's point of view
Finally, there is one family movie that quite eloquently explores the depth of human emotion -- only its stars are bears.For the second time, in a movie called "The Bear," French director Jean-Jacques Annaud demonstrates just how powerful pictures can be
For the second time, in a movie called "The Bear," French director Jean-Jacques Annaud demonstrates just how powerful pictures can be. ("Quest for Fire" was the first time

Westinghouse expects to meet its corporate goals despite a softening in the economy.Even if the gross national product is either flat or in the growth range of 2% to 2.5%, "we can handle that
which is experiencing a surge of growth for the first time in years.the business will achieve higher sales this year than the company's target goal of 8.5%
While Westinghouse hasn't had a nuclear power plant order from a U.S. utility in about a decade, excess capacity is beginning to shrink.the company foresees the need for a major boost in new-generation capability throughout the 1990s
Westinghouse also is well positioned to sell steam turbine and gas turbine plants to independent power producers.The company's ability to respond to energy needs world-wide will be enhanced through a recently announced venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
Westinghouse also expects its international sales to soon grow to 25% of total corporate sales from 20% last year.The company is negotiating with the Soviets to build a Thermo King truck-refrigeration plant that would produce about 10,000 units annually
Mr. Marous said Westinghouse would own 70% of the facility.The deal, which will involve an initial $20 million investment, was struck with a handshake, he added
Company officials also said that any gain from the sale of Westinghouse's 55% stake in its transmission and distribution venture with the Swiss firm of Asea Brown Boveri will be offset by a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter.The executives didn't disclose the size of the expected gain

researchers with business ties are more likely to falsify findings in order to tout new drugs.As ties between academia and venture capital have blossomed in recent years, governmental fear of abuse has risen
The NIH is asking grant recipients and others for comments on the proposed guidelines until Dec. 15.After that, it will make a final decision on the policy
The guidelines could foil future arrangements similar to the deal behind Lithox Inc., a Salem, Mass., start-up.With $2.3 million, he and other investors launched Lithox last year to market a gallstone cure being developed by researchers of the University of California at San Diego. The researchers, who are being financed by the Lithox funds, will receive a royalty, or percentage of sales, if their research yields a commercial product.But because the University of California, like many other universities, shares its royalties with researchers, it may disqualify itself from federal funds under the proposed guidelines
For instance, Commonwealth BioVentures Inc., a venture-capital concern, last month invested $600,000 to launch Amira Inc., a Worcester, Mass., concern that will produce pharmaceuticals.Scientists Rima Kaddurah-Daouk and Paul Schimmel conducted the initial research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Scientists Rima Kaddurah-Daouk and Paul Schimmel conducted the initial research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.While Ms. Kaddurah-Daouk left MIT to head Amira, Prof.Schimmel will continue to work at MIT, serve on Amira's board and own a small equity stake in the company
The Amira transaction is typical of the way venture-capital firms are approaching the task of commercializing biotechnology research.While universities develop the basic research, "venture capitalists are the ones best positioned to finance its commercialization
While universities develop the basic research, "venture capitalists are the ones best positioned to finance its commercialization.This is the best way to transfer technology straight off the campuses of universities
The stakes in the controversy are large.Last year, venture capitalists spent an estimated $600 million to finance start-up companies in medical and biotechnology businesses, according to the National Venture Capital Association, a trade group
Last year, venture capitalists spent an estimated $600 million to finance start-up companies in medical and biotechnology businesses, according to the National Venture Capital Association, a trade group.Many of the deals involved transactions in which scientific institutions or researchers agreed to commercialize their work in return for an equity stake or royalties
In many of these deals, "venture capitalists had the inside track.Investors were willing to gamble on new technologies because "we had exclusive rights to those technologies
But under the proposed guidelines, all federally funded research will have to be reported publicly so that anyone can capitalize on the work. "Without the exclusivity, most venture capitalists won't have the incentive to invest in such deals
But before Athena was able to get an exclusive license to the technology, the Federal Register published most of the details, "giving all of the company's potential competitors a chance to exploit it.Athena eventually acquired exclusive rights to the technology
The proposed guidelines could also delay commercialization -- and force small companies to waste scarce capital.If start-ups can't have early access to research being conducted at institutions, "we have to replicate it ourselves or do without the research
If start-ups can't have early access to research being conducted at institutions, "we have to replicate it ourselves or do without the research.Duplicating research is both costly and time-consuming for a start-up
that its guidelines "should not stifle research creativity or technology transfer from the research laboratory to commercial use." Universities such as Harvard and MIT should be able to develop a way to act as brokers for the individual scientists
that have already begun to surface in scientific ventures.Not long ago, scientists holding stock in Spectra Pharmaceutical Services Inc. were accused of falsifying research to boost the stock

The filing, made yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here, follows an agreement by L.J. Hooker Corp., Merksamer's owner, to sell the chain to management for an undisclosed price.GE Capital Corp., a financial services subsidiary of General Electric Co., is providing Merksamer management with $15 million in financing
L.J. Hooker, based in Atlanta, filed for Chapter 11 protection in August and has also announced its intention to sell its B. Altman & Co. department store chain.L.J. Hooker is owned by Hooker Corp., Sydney, Australia, which itself is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator
Rumors to the effect that the Merksamer chain would file for Chapter 11 arose last week in the jewelry industry.At that time, Sam Merksamer, president of the chain, angrily denied that his company was about to file
At that time, Sam Merksamer, president of the chain, angrily denied that his company was about to file.Mr. Merksamer is leading the buy-out
According to executives close to the situation, Merksamer filed for Chapter 11 to speed the sale of the chain.an accord signed by the unsecured creditors of L.J. Hooker Corp. had frozen in place all of L.J. Hooker's assets
The Merksamer bankruptcy-law filing appears to supersede that agreement. "By filing for Chapter 11, the Merksamer chain will only need approval from a bankruptcy judge for the sale, not the hundreds of unsecured creditors
By filing for Chapter 11, the Merksamer chain will only need approval from a bankruptcy judge for the sale, not the hundreds of unsecured creditors.The cash from the sale will go to L.J. Hooker, but the company itself will belong to Sam Merksamer
Mr. Merksamer and Sanford Sigoloff, chief executive of L.J. Hooker, were unavailable for comment.In a statement, Mr. Merksamer described the filing as a "legal technicality," but also said that "our inability to obtain trade credit, combined with a need to ensure that our stores were properly stocked for the Christmas season, necessitated our filing Chapter 11
For all of this year's explosive run-up in stock prices, Renaissance Investment Management Inc. 's computer sat on the sidelines.Now it's on the fence
Renaissance, a Cincinnati-based money manager, began buying stocks again this week with half of the $1.8 billion that it oversees for clients, according to people familiar with the firm's revised strategy.It was the first time since January that Renaissance has thought stocks are worth owning
but its stock purchases were thought to have begun Tuesday, timed to coincide with the maturity this week of Treasury bills owned by the firm.The other half of its portfolio is expected to remain invested in Treasury bills for the time being
they believed that Renaissance's $900 million buy program was carried out by PaineWebber Inc.PaineWebber bought shares Tuesday as part of a customer strategy shift
As reported, PaineWebber bought shares Tuesday as part of a customer strategy shift.Yesterday, PaineWebber declined comment
When it owns stocks, Renaissance's portfolio typically is composed of about 60 large-capitalization issues; to make buy or sell moves, the firm solicits Wall Street brokerage houses a day or so in advance, looking for the best package price to carry out the trades
to make buy or sell moves, the firm solicits Wall Street brokerage houses a day or so in advance, looking for the best package price to carry out the trades.The broker winning the business doesn't charge commissions, but instead profits by buying or selling for less than the overall package price
That puts the broker at risk if it's trying to buy stock in a rising market.In Tuesday's gyrating session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 80 points early in the day, but finished with less than a four-point loss
Renaissance's last portfolio shift, carried out by Goldman, Sachs & Co., was a highly publicized decision last January to sell its entire stock portfolio and buy Treasury bills.The sell signal, which sent a bearish chill through the stock market, came when Renaissance's computer found that stocks were overpriced compared with bonds and Treasury bills
At the time, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at about 2200.The Dow average now stands more than 20% higher, while Renaissance's portfolio of Treasurys produced a return of about 6% through the first three quarters of the year
The Dow average now stands more than 20% higher, while Renaissance's portfolio of Treasurys produced a return of about 6% through the first three quarters of the year.The computer's miscalculation has been painful for Renaissance
The computer's miscalculation has been painful for Renaissance.Almost any money manager holding stocks has turned in better results, while Renaissance has played it safe with Treasury bills
Stock prices, meanwhile, are about 140 points lower than the peak of 2791.41 reached on the Dow industrial average Oct. 9.Are those declines enough to signal a partial return to stocks
that if there was such a move, it would take about three days to complete the loose ends of the transaction.During that time, a buyer with the clout of a Renaissance could end up driving up the price of stocks it was trying to buy if it tipped its hand
so stocks in his view can become more attractive in comparison with bonds or T-bills, even if shares are more expensive than when they were sold in January. "Our {computer} model has a certain trigger point, When the computer says switch, Renaissance switches
Our {computer} model has a certain trigger point," he said.When the computer says switch, Renaissance switches
The firm has made 17 previous shifts from one type of asset to another in its 10-year history.Almost all have involved at least half and often the firm's entire portfolio, as the computer searches for the most undervalued investment category, following a money-management style called tactical asset allocation
Qintex Entertainment also said Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Jonathan Lloyd, 37 years old, would join the nine-member board.He succeeds Roger Kimmel, who resigned last week saying his participation in evaluating the company's role in buying MGM/UA Communications Co. was no longer necessary
It was the 49-year-old Mr. Evans who had moved into the offices of MGM/UA and run the company during Qintex Australia Ltd. 's aborted bid for the movie company.After MGM/UA terminated the $1.5 billion merger because of a dispute over a $50 million letter of credit, Qintex Entertainment -- which is 43%-owned by Qintex Australia -- found itself facing problems of its own
On Oct. 19, Qintex Entertainment was about to default on a $5.9 million payment owed to MCA Inc. in connection with the distribution of a television program.Qintex Entertainment was depending on Qintex Australia to arrange financing
he believed Qintex Australia wouldn't be forthcoming.He recommended that the company file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code before the MCA deadline, according to a source familiar with the sessions
But a majority of the board, which includes three members from the Australian company, overrode him.Mr. Evans resigned
Mr. Evans resigned.Later in the day, according to the source, the board reversed itself, decided to file for bankruptcy protection, and asked Mr. Evans to stay on

On top of this, the traveler who converts his dollars into foreign currency before the trip starts will lose interest from the day of conversion.At the end of the trip, any unspent foreign exchange will have to be converted back into dollars, with another commission due

Of the total purchase price, $50 million cash and $30 million in stock (nearly 1.8 million shares) would be paid to buy the existing 700-room Marina Hotel & Casino from Southwest Securities, a Nevada limited partnership.The remaining properties to be acquired are the Tropicana Country Club & Golf Course, a facility jointly owned by Ramada Inc., of Phoenix, Ariz., and the Jaffe family, and a small parcel owned by MGM Grand director James D. Aljian
The purchase price was disclosed in a preliminary prospectus issued in connection with MGM Grand's planned offering of six million common shares.The luxury airline and casino company, 98.6%-owned by investor Kirk Kerkorian and his Tracinda Corp., earlier this month announced its agreements to acquire the properties, but didn't disclose the purchase price
Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for remodeling the company's Desert Inn resort in Las Vegas, refurbishing certain aircraft of the MGM Grand Air unit, and to acquire the property for the new resort.The company said it estimates the Desert Inn remodeling will cost about $32 million, and the refurbishment of the three DC-8-62 aircraft, made by McDonnell Douglas Corp., will cost around $24.5 million
the latest stock offering won't cover the $600 million or more cost of building the proposed resort and theme park, and added it will need to seek additional financing, either through bank borrowings or debt and equity offerings, at a later date.Construction is set to begin in early 1991
that will include 5,000 rooms and 85,000 square feet of casino space.The facility will be marketed toward families
Assets of the 400 taxable funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report jumped to $351.2 billion in the week ended Tuesday.Assets soared $4.5 billion in the previous week
Meanwhile, the average yield on taxable funds dropped nearly a tenth of a percentage point, the largest drop since midsummer.The average seven-day compound yield fell to 8.47%, its lowest since late last year, from 8.55% the week before, according to Donoghue's
Lower yields are just reflecting lower short-term interest rates.Money funds invest in such things as short-term Treasury securities, commercial paper and certificates of deposit, all of which have been posting lower interest rates since last spring
The yield on six-month Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction, for example, was just 7.77%.The average yield on six-month CDs of $50,000 or less at major banks was 7.96% in the week ended Tuesday, according to Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information service
One way that money fund managers boost yields in a declining rate environment is by extending the maturities of their investments.The average maturity of the taxable funds that Donoghue's follows increased by two days in the latest week to 40 days, its longest since August
when short-term interest rates were moving steadily upward.The average seven-day compound yield of the funds reached 9.62% in late April
The highest-yielding funds are still above 9%.The top-performing fund in the latest week was Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar, with a seven-day compound yield of 9.45%

The fund invests heavily in dollar-denominated money-market securities overseas.It is currently waiving management fees
The average seven-day simple yield of the 400 funds fell to 8.14% from 8.21%.The average 30-day simple yield slid to 8.22% from 8.26%
Many small investors are facing a double whammy this year: They got hurt by investing in the highly risky junk bond market
where a 25% leveraged portfolio in effect allows investors to have 125% of their money working for them.The strategy boosts current yield by putting more bonds into the portfolio
That's really where the leverage hurt.Share prices performed even worse than the funds' asset values
which aren't publicly traded and aren't allowed to use leverage at all.Leverage is used only by some of the closed-end funds
The usual maneuver is to borrow against the portfolio value or issue preferred stock, using the proceeds to buy additional bonds.The fallout for investors lately has been painful
Consider the New America High Income Fund.With a leveraged position of about 45%, the fund's share price has plunged 28.5% so far this year
With a leveraged position of about 45%, the fund's share price has plunged 28.5% so far this year.That's worse than the price drop sustained by the bonds in its portfolio, whose total return (bond-price changes plus interest) has amounted to a negative 6.08%
Many investors are unaware their funds have borrowed to speculate in such a risky market. "If someone actually sat down and thought about what they were being sold they might shy away
In a typical leverage strategy, a fund tries to capture the spread between what it costs to borrow and the higher return on the bonds it buys with the borrowed money.If the market surges, holders can make that much more profit
If the market surges, holders can make that much more profit; the leverage effectively acts as an interest-free margin account for investors
Fund managers, for their part, defend their use of leverage.Carl Ericson, who runs the Colonial Intermediate High Income Fund, says the fund's 25% leverage has jacked up its interest income
the fund's 25% leverage has jacked up its interest income. "As long as I am borrowing at 9.9% and each {bond} yields over that, it enhances the yield
As long as I am borrowing at 9.9% and each {bond} yields over that, it enhances the yield," he maintains.Mr. Ericson says he tries to offset the leverage by diversifying the fund's portfolio
Yet some funds have pulled in their horns.that it plans to reduce its leverage position by buying back $5 million in preferred stock and notes from investors
that it plans to reduce its leverage position by buying back $5 million in preferred stock and notes from investors.The fund made a similar move earlier this year
We are trying to increase our flexibility," says Ellen E. Terry, a vice president at Ostrander Capital Management, the fund's investment adviser.She declined to elaborate
the fund's recent performance "illustrates what happens in a leveraged product" when the market doesn't cooperate. "When the market turns around it will give a nice picture" of how leverage can help performance
But a few funds have taken other defensive steps.Some have raised their cash positions to record levels
Some have raised their cash positions to record levels.High cash positions help buffer a fund when the market falls
Prospect Street High Income Portfolio, for instance, now holds about 15% in cash and equivalents, nearly quintuple the amount it held earlier this year.the fund, which is 40% leveraged, has maintained a "substantial cushion" between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio's bonds
the fund, which is 40% leveraged, has maintained a "substantial cushion" between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio's bonds. "I don't want to be in a position to have to sell
Other funds have recently sold weak junk bonds to raise cash.At the 50%-leveraged Zenith Income Fund, portfolio manager John Bianchi recently dumped Mesa Petroleum, Wickes and Horsehead Industries, among others, to raise his cash position to a record 15%
That's a problem because cash isn't earning us very much money.This is the most difficult market that I've been involved in
We're looking at the leverage factor every day.At some point, if we are unable to cover our leveraged cost we're going to have to make a move

Ms. Bartlett's previous work, which earned her an international reputation in the non-horticultural art world, often took gardens as its nominal subject.Mayhap this metaphorical connection made the BPC Fine Arts Committee think she had a literal green thumb
Mayhap this metaphorical connection made the BPC Fine Arts Committee think she had a literal green thumb. (Ms.Bartlett would not discuss her garden for this article
And she proved no shirking violet in her initial statement to the BPCA, a New York State public benefit corporation: "The only thing I was interested in doing was a very complicated garden
I don't view this as a landscape.I view this as a building
The third principal in the South Gardens adventure did have garden experience.The firm of Bruce Kelly/David Varnell Landscape Architects had created Central Park's Strawberry Fields and Shakespeare Garden
Undeterred, the BPCA hired Ms. Bartlett and another confessed garden ignoramus, the architect Alexander Cooper, who claimed he had never visited, much less built, a garden, and said of the project, "I don't view this as a landscape.I view this as a building The firm of Bruce Kelly/David Varnell Landscape Architects had created Central Park's Strawberry Fields and Shakespeare Garden.The BPCA called its team a "stunning" collaboration
After four years, though, the South Gardens design is 100% uncollaborated Jennifer Bartlett.She has done little more than recycle her standard motifs -- trees, water, landscape fragments, rudimentary square houses, circles, triangles, rectangles -- and fit them into a grid, as if she were making one of her gridded two-dimensional works for a gallery wall
But for South Gardens, the grid was to be a 3-D network of masonry or hedge walls with real plants inside them.In a letter to the BPCA, kelly/varnell called this "arbitrary and amateurish

As she put it in a 1987 lecture at the Harvard Graduate School of Design: "I have designed a garden, not knowing the difference between a rhododendron and a tulip." Moreover, she proclaimed that "landscape architects have been going wrong for the last 20 years" in the design of open space.And she further stunned her listeners by revealing her secret garden design method: Commissioning a friend to spend "five or six thousand dollars . . . on books that I ultimately cut up." After that, the layout had been easy. "I've always relied heavily on the grid and found it never to fail." Ms. Bartlett told her audience that she absolutely did not believe in compromise or in giving in to the client "because I don't think you can do watered-down versions of things
Ms. Bartlett told her audience that she absolutely did not believe in compromise or in giving in to the client "because I don't think you can do watered-down versions of things." (This was never a problem with South Gardens, because the client had long since given in to Ms. Bartlett's every whim
Last year the public was afforded a preview of Ms. Bartlett's creation in a tablemodel version, at a BPC exhibition.The labels were breathy: "Within its sheltering walls is a microcosm of a thousand years in garden design . . . a rose garden, herb garden, serpentine garden, flower fields, an apple orchard . . . organized in a patchwork of 50-by-50-foot squares to form `rooms' . . . here and there are simple architectural forms, a whimsical jet of water, a conceit of topiary or tartan plaid, and chairs of every sort to drag around. . . .

In one garden roomette she implanted a 43-foot square glass cube meant to show off a plaid tile floor conceit, a "zinc sink," a "huge fishbowl with carp" and a "birdcage with cockatoos." Next door she put a smaller plaid-floored glass house, where, she suggested, a flat of strawberries might be displayed in the dead of winter
One thing about the Bartlett plan was never in doubt: It would demand the full-time skills of a battalion of topiary barbers, rosarians, orchardists and arborists
It would demand the full-time skills of a battalion of topiary barbers, rosarians, orchardists and arborists.Ms. Bartlett blithely suggested calling upon "semi-skilled garden club workers for maintenance
Then, to make these gardenettes quite literally rooms, Ms. Bartlett had thrown up windowless walls (brick, lattice, hedge) eight to 10 feet tall, casting her interiors into day-long Stygian shade.It was hard to see how photosynthesis would ever happen in South Gardens without decking the walls in a Christmas-like array of Gro-Lites
Ms. Bartlett threw up yet another wall, this time concrete, this time 10 1/2 feet tall.She ran it the length of the South Gardens riverfront, blotting out the city's great natural water features, the harbor and the river

Lynden B. Miller, the noted public garden designer who restored Central Park's Conservatory Garden, recalls her reaction to the South Gardens model in light of the public garden she was designing for 42nd Street's Bryant Park: "Bryant Park, as designed in 1933, failed as a public space, because it made people feel trapped.By removing the hedges and some walls, the Bryant Park Restoration is opening it up.It seems to me the BPCA plan has the potential of making South Gardens a horticultural jail for people and plants

Despite the dire assessments of knowledgeable garden professionals, Ms. Bartlett's South Gardens design somehow continues on, seemingly impervious to reason, stalled only by bureaucratic lethargy and logistical complications.BPCA President and CEO David Emil hopes to negotiate a seawall that could "be significantly more visually permeable
And by substituting yet another landscape architect, Nicholas Quennell, he insists he can achieve that and other accommodations to gardening reality while still preserving the "artistic vision" of a "truly great artist." After four years of no progress in this direction, it is doubtful any viable collaboration with Ms. Bartlett will suddenly now be possible
Unhappily, our gardeners for ages have suffered at the hands of the decorative artist when applying his `designs' to the garden. . . . It is this adapting of absurd `knots' and patterns from old books to any surface where a flower garden has to be made that leads to bad and frivolous design -- wrong in plan and hopeless for the life of plants

Mr. Angell is incorrect when he states that the Soviet Union's large gold reserves would give it "great power to establish credibility."

During the latter part of the 19th century, Russia was on a gold standard and had gold reserves representing more than 100% of its outstanding currency, but no one outside Russia used rubles. The Bank of England, on the other hand, had gold reserves that averaged about 30% of its outstanding currency, and Bank of England notes were accepted throughout the world.The most likely reason for this disparity is that the Bank of England was a private bank with substantial earning assets, and the common-law rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in Britain
The success of the British gold standard was due to independent private banking and common law, rather than the choice of gold for valuing the currency.It is no coincidence that from 1844 to 1914, when the Bank of England was an independent private bank, the pound was never devalued and payment of gold for pound notes was never suspended, but with the subsequent nationalization of the Bank of England, the pound was devalued with increasing frequency and its use as an international medium of exchange declined
to establish the ruble as an international currency.One way to make the ruble into a major international currency would be to leave reserves of gold and earning assets in a Swiss bank with distributions based on Swiss laws

the agency is studying the Friday the 13th market plunge, including how current circuit breakers affected the market that day and the following Monday.After the study, the SEC would be willing to consider adding new circuit breakers or fine-tuning the current ones
Circuit breakers, designed to give the markets a breather in cases of sharp price movements, curb trading of futures or stocks at various trigger points.At certain points during the Friday the 13th drop, circuit breakers kicked in on the futures market, slowing trading at times
At certain points during the Friday the 13th drop, circuit breakers kicked in on the futures market, slowing trading at times.A circuit breaker that would have closed down the New York Stock Exchange wasn't tripped
Rep. Edward Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, is pushing the idea of a circuit breaker for computer-driven program trading in hopes that would curb "turmoil" in the marketplace.He argued that program-trading by roughly 15 big institutions is pushing around the markets and scaring individual investors
Mr. Breeden didn't reject the proposal.After the SEC study of the drop is completed, he said, "I'm perfectly happy to work with this committee . . . in identifying whether we need other devices," such as a program-trading curb
Mr. Breeden backed most of the provisions in a market-reform bill that the SEC brought to the subcommittee last year under then-chairman David Ruder.The measure is expected to move through this Congress
that uncertainty over when the SEC might act could worsen volatility in the markets.He argued that the current circuit-breaker system allows investors to know "precisely when and where any trading interruptions will occur and how long they will last
Mr. Breeden offered strong support for two other provisions in the bill.One would force brokerage houses to provide the SEC detailed information about loans made by their holding companies

In a rare package sale of its real estate, K mart Corp., Troy, Mich., has sold 17 of its strip shopping centers to a limited partnership led by New York developer Philip Pilevsky, according to sources familiar with the transaction.They estimate the value of the transaction at close to $100 million
third-quarter earnings will drop between 13% and 20% to about 50 to 55 cents per share, compared with 63 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.It is unclear what effect the sale of the shopping centers will have on earnings
K mart developed the centers, which range in size from about 150,000 square feet to just over 250,000 square feet.Most are anchored by a K mart store
Most are anchored by a K mart store.The retailer reportedly will lease its stores back from the developer, who plans to expand the small centers
The centers comprise a total of about 1.6 million square feet of retail space.They are spread around the country and include locations in California, Florida, Washington and Arizona
Mr. Pilevsky, who heads Philips International Holding Corp., a New York-based real estate company, owns more than a dozen other shopping centers in which K mart is a tenant.The company is active in office and residential development in New York
K mart runs 2,200 K mart stores, primarily in leased facilities.The company typically sells the centers it develops, but has usually sold only one or several at a time

The direct-mail industry, not surprisingly, is fuming at the injustice of it all.After all, this is the industry that has a hard enough time getting any respect, that is the butt of so many jokes that television's "L.A.Law" portrays direct-mail-mogul David as short, bald, intensely nerdy, and unremittingly boring

Direct-mail executives see GM's stand as an ominous sign.Why anyone would want to close themselves off {from direct mail}, a priori, doesn't make any sense," says Michael Bronner of Bronner Slosberg Associates, a Boston directmail firm.

Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) was confident he had enough votes to block the maneuver on procedural grounds, perhaps as soon as today.Mr. Packwood all but conceded defeat, telling Mr. Mitchell: "I sense at this stage you may have the votes
The two lawmakers sparred in a highly personal fashion, violating usual Senate decorum.Their tone was good-natured
And Democrats, who are under increasing pressure from their leaders to reject the gains-tax cut, are finding reasons to say no, at least for now.A major reason is that they believe the Packwood-Roth plan would lose buckets of revenue over the long run
advocates of the tax cut less optimistic about success. "There is a one-out-of-three shot of getting it this year," said Sen. David Boren of Oklahoma, a leading Democratic proponent of cutting the capital-gains tax

When it threatened to use this provision as the test for a line-item veto, Congress caved.The fear Congress has of any line-item-veto test led Members to add the single most contorted and ridiculous provision this year, "This section shall be effective only on Oct. 1, 1989

The Kemper Corp. unit and other critics complain that program trading causes wild swings in stock prices, such as on Tuesday and on Oct. 13 and 16, and has increased chances for market crashes.Over the past nine months, several firms, including discount broker Charles Schwab & Co. and Sears, Roebuck & Co. 's Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. unit, have attacked program trading as a major market evil
But most of them, led by Morgan Stanley & Co., moved back in earlier this year.The most volatile form of program trading is index arbitrage -- the rapid-fire, computer-guided buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in stock-index futures and options
The most volatile form of program trading is index arbitrage -- the rapid-fire, computer-guided buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in stock-index futures and options.The object is to capture profits from fleeting price discrepancies between the futures and options and the stocks themselves
Index arbitrage recently has accounted for about half of all program trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Last month, program trading accounted for 20.9 million shares a day, or a record 13.8% of the Big Board's average daily volume
On Tuesday afternoon, Kemper told Bear, Stearns & Co., General Electric Co. 's Kidder, Peabody & Co. unit, Morgan Stanley and Oppenheimer & Co. that it will no longer do business with them because of their commitment to index arbitrage.Kemper officials declined to identify the firms
We've been opposed to" index arbitrage "for a long time.Index arbitrage doesn't work, and it scares natural buyers" of stock

We've talked to proponents of index arbitrage and told them to cool it because they're ruining the market.They said, `Too bad
Kemper also blasted the Big Board for ignoring the interests of individual and institutional holders. "The New York Stock Exchange has vested interests" in its big member securities firms "that cloud its objectivity," Mr. Timbers said. "It has never been interested in what we think.The Big Board also has a terrible communication problem with individual investors," he added

that he has no inclination to eliminate program trading.but that all the exchange can do is "slow down the process" by using its circuit breakers and shock absorbers
Morgan Stanley and Kidder Peabody, the two biggest program trading firms, staunchly defend their strategies. "We continue to believe the position we've taken is reasonable," a Morgan Stanley official said. "We would stop index arbitrage when the market is under stress, and we have recently," he said, citing Oct. 13 and earlier this week.Michael Carpenter, president and chief executive officer at Kidder Peabody, said in a recent interview, "We don't think that index arbitrage has a negative impact on the market as a whole

Every day, Mr. Levy checks orders from Campeau department store chains.I'm now monitoring every major account
Campeau, owner of such retailers as Bloomingdale's, Bon Marche, and Jordan Marsh, sidestepped financial collapse last month after an emergency $250 million loan from Olympia & York Developments Ltd., a Canadian developer and a major shareholder in Campeau.The need for the loan surprised many analysts and bond holders who had been told at the company's annual meeting in July that there weren't any major problems ahead
Orders from Campeau retailers used to be cause for celebration.This is no longer true because of Campeau's massive debt load

Other credit houses, such as Credit Exchange and Solo Credit Service Corp., are suggesting that their clients study each order before shipping. "Payments are good right now, but we aren't recommending any long-term lines of credit," says Richard Hastings, a retail credit analyst
Payments are good right now, but we aren't recommending any long-term lines of credit.The Campeau situation is a little uncertain and very difficult to analyze
Because of those concerns, some manufacturers say they will ask for letters of credit before shipping spring merchandise. "We're being paid today, but we're worried about tomorrow and will want" letters of credit, says the sales director at one major dress maker who asked not to be identified
It's big time chaos today.I'm going to ship and hope I get paid

Typically, manufacturers are paid 10 days after the month in which they ship.If goods are shipped to Bloomingdale's between Oct. 1 and Oct. 20, manufacturers expect to be paid by Nov. 10
But manufacturers now buying fabric for spring season goods won't be paid until March, April or even May.Some in the market question whether Campeau will be in a position to pay bills at that time
Everybody is worried about the possibility of cancellations.The buyers who work for the various Campeau chains may lose their jobs

Campeau's financial situation is complicated by an estimated $1.23 billion in debt due next spring.This includes a working capital facility for Allied Stores of $350 million that matures March 15, 1990, and an $800 million bridge loan due April 30, 1990

In recent months, numerous retailers have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, including Bonwit Teller, B. Altman & Co., and Miller & Rhoads Inc.Those filings, plus the expected sale of a number of financially healthy chains, such as Saks Fifth Avenue, Marshall Field's and Bloomingdale's, have added to the anxiety

Bethlehem, the nation's second largest steelmaker, earned $46.9 million, or 54 cents a share.The figures include $15 million in costs related to a blast furnace outage and $8 million in losses from unauthorized work outages at the company's coal operations
The figures include $15 million in costs related to a blast furnace outage and $8 million in losses from unauthorized work outages at the company's coal operations.In the year-ago period, Bethlehem earned $101.4 million, or $1.27 a share, including a $3.8 million gain from early retirement of debt
Of all the major steelmakers, Bethlehem would seem to be the most vulnerable to a slowdown.It hasn't diversified beyond steel, nor has it linked up with a joint venture partner to share costs and risks
However, in spite of the difficult industrywide environment of high cost and low volume, Bethlehem "had pretty good earnings numbers.third-quarter earnings of 55 cents a share
Still, Bethlehem's core basic steel operations experienced a steep drop in operating profit to $58.6 million from $186.4 million a year ago.its shipments declined as a result of a reduction in inventories by service centers, a lackluster automotive market and increasing competitive pressures in the construction market
third-quarter net income dropped 8% to $33 million, or 35 cents a share, from $36 million, or 39 cents a share in the year-ago quarter.Sales dropped to $441.1 million from $820.4 million, because the company no longer consolidates its Eastern Steel division, which is now a joint venture with Kawasaki Steel Corp
by holding higher-cost inventory when raw material costs of such key products as nickel dropped.Operating profit dropped 46% in its specialty flat-rolled steel segment
National Intergroup, which owns 50% of the nation's sixth largest steelmaker -- National Steel Corp. -- posted net income for the fiscal second-quarter of $8.6 million, or 33 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $50.3 million.Sales increased in the quarter ended Sept. 30 to $747.8 million from $623.5 million a year ago

The latest period includes gains of $9.1 million from early retirement of debt and tax loss carry-forward.Last year's results were hurt by $41.3 million in restructuring charges
However, its equity in the net income of National Steel declined to $6.3 million from $10.9 million as a result of softer demand and lost orders following prolonged labor talks and a threatened strike.National Intergroup is negotiating for the sale of its 50% interest in National Steel to concentrate more fully on drug distribution operations

In a stunning shift in direction, Provigo Inc. said it will sell all its non-food operations to concentrate solely on its retail and wholesale grocery business.The non-food operations accounted for about 27% of Provigo's 7.38 billion Canadian dollars (US$6.3 billion) in sales in the latest fiscal year
In a related move, Pierre Lortie, chairman and chief executive, resigned.Mr. Lortie joined Provigo in 1985 and spearheaded the company's drive to grow outside its traditional food business
Mr. Lortie joined Provigo in 1985 and spearheaded the company's drive to grow outside its traditional food business.He couldn't be reached for comment
Bertin Nadeau, newly appointed chairman and interim chief executive of Provigo, wouldn't say if Mr. Lortie was asked to leave. "Mr.Lortie felt less pertinent," Mr. Nadeau said, given the decision to dump Provigo's non-food operations
Mr.Lortie felt less pertinent," Mr. Nadeau said, given the decision to dump Provigo's non-food operations. "At this stage I was perhaps more pertinent as chief executive
At a news conference, Mr. Nadeau said the sale of the three non-food businesses, which account for nearly half the company's C$900 million in assets, should be completed in a "matter of months." The three units are a nationwide pharmaceutical and health-products distributor, a small sporting-goods chain, and a combination catalog showroom and toy-store chain
Investors and analysts applauded the news.Provigo was the most active industrial stock on the Montreal Exchange, where it closed at C$9.75 (US$8.32), up 75 Canadian cents.

United pilots have shown on a number of occasions they are willing and able to strike.If you have both {labor} groups on strike, you've got no revenue and that's a very scary thing for a bank to be looking at
because their employer has yet to settle with either on new contracts.That gives them both the threat of a strike and the ability to resist any wage concessions that may be necessary to make a transaction work

There's less likelihood of creating and completing a transaction without the unions' cooperation and wage concessions," said Richard Nye, of Baker, Nye Investments, a New York takeover stock-trader.Mr. Nye thinks the UAL board should be ousted if it doesn't move soon to increase shareholder value
Both the pilots and machinists have made it clear that they intend to block any transaction they don't like. "The pilots will be involved in any transaction that takes place around here," pilot union chairman Frederick C. Dubinsky declared yesterday
his union would like majority ownership for employees.At the very least, the pilots want some form of control over the airline, perhaps through super-majority voting rights
Still, in recent days, machinists' union leaders have shown some new flexibility. "We may be able to reach a tradeoff where we can accommodate {the pilot union's} concerns and ours
The machinists lobbied heavily against the original bid from UAL pilots and management for the company.Their opposition helped scare off some Japanese banks
The pilots' insistence on majority ownership also may make the idea of a recapitalization difficult to achieve. "Who wants to be a public shareholder investing in a company controlled by the pilots' union
Who wants to be a public shareholder investing in a company controlled by the pilots' union.Who would the board be working for -- the public shareholders or the pilots
who might try to force the ouster of the board through the solicitation of consents.In that way, the pilots may be able to force the board to approve a recapitalization that gives employees a majority stake, or to consider the labor-management group's latest proposal
the dynamics of this situation are that something's got to happen.The board and UAL's management can't go back" to business as usual

For the quarter a year ago, Columbia reported earnings of $16.3 million, or 37 cents a share.Total assets increased to $12.7 billion in the latest quarter from $12.4 billion a year earlier
Columbia owes its spectacular growth in recent years to its junk-bond portfolio, the largest of any U.S. thrift.Much of Columbia's junk-bond trading has been done through the high-yield department of its Beverly Hills neighbor, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc
increasing general reserves to $300 million, or about 6.7% of the total portfolio, as of Sept. 30.On June 30, loss reserves stood at $108.3 million
On June 30, loss reserves stood at $108.3 million.Thrift officials said the $300 million reserve will be adjusted quarterly and will reflect the rate of dispositions and market conditions
Previously, Columbia didn't have to adjust the book value of its junk-bond holdings to reflect declines in market prices, because it held the bonds as long-term investments.Because Columbia now must sell the bonds within five years, accounting rules require the thrift to value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices
Columbia announced the results after the close of the stock market.Its shares closed at $5.125 each in composite New York Stock Exchange trading, down 37.5 cents

Over the summer, Anheuser competitors offered more and deeper discounts than industry observers have seen for a long time.Anheuser's entry into the fray means near-term earnings trouble for all the industry players
major rivals, Philip Morris Co. 's Miller Brewing unit and Adolph Coors Co. "have been following a policy of continuous and deep discounting for at least the past 18 months" on their premium brands, pricing their product as much as 25 cents a 12-pack below Anheuser's Budweiser label in many markets.it's discounting policy basically would involve matching such moves by rivals on a market-by-market basis
third-quarter net income rose a lower-than-anticipated 5.2% to $238.3 million, or 83 cents a share, from $226.5 million, or 78 cents.Third-period sales were $2.49 billion, up from last year's $2.34 billion
its new strategy -- started in some markets last month and expected to be applied soon in selected markets nationwide -- will mean lower-than-anticipated earnings for the last half of 1989 and for 1990.The projection sent Anheuser shares plunging $4.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday

The projection sent Anheuser shares plunging $4.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.The stock closed at $38.50 on heavy volume of about 3.5 million shares.Shares of Coors, the company's sole publicly traded major competitor, fell $1.50 apiece to $19.125 in national over-the-counter trading, apparently on investor concerns over potential fallout from the coming pricing struggle
it will take "appropriate competitive pricing actions to support our long-term market share growth strategy" for the premium brands.it continues to hold to its earlier-announced goal of a 50% U.S. market share by the mid-1990s

Anheuser is the biggest guy in the bar, and he just decided to join in the barroom brawl.It's going to get bloody
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. analyst George E. Thompson downplayed the importance of the announcement, and called any comparison between the coming beer-industry tiff and the seemingly unending "cola wars," unwarranted.discounting "a loser's game for anyone without a dominant market share that Anheuser's statement of intent could simply be a means of warning competitors to ease up on price-cutting or face a costly and fruitless battle
But Smith Barney's Mr. Doyle called the market's reaction "justified." While the third-quarter earnings were a "moderate disappointment," he said, "the real bad news is the intensity of price competition" in the premium-beer sector
According to Mr. Steinman, the newsletter publisher, Anheuser's market share is nearly twice that of its nearest competitor, Miller Brewing, which had a 21.2% stake last year.It's followed by Stroh Brewery Co
which has agreed to sell its assets to Coors.Both Coors and Stroh have recently been ceding market share to Miller and Anheuser

The 231-191 roll call illustrates the limits of power a resurgent abortion-rights movement still faces.It continues to gain strength in the chamber but remains far short of the two-thirds majority required to prevail over Mr. Bush
Yesterday's vote dealt with the largest of these bills, an estimated $156.7 billion measure funding the departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services.To gain more leverage, abortion-rights advocates may seek to fold the bill into an omnibus continuing resolution next month
the president is in a commanding position for at least this year. "Unless he changes, they lose
as Congress sent to the president last night a stopgap spending bill to keep the government operating through Nov. 15 and provide $2.85 billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake.By a lopsided 97-1 margin, the Senate approved the measure after attaching further provisions sought by the influential California delegation and, despite reservations, the House adopted the bill on a 303-107 roll call
But given the political importance of California, the administration was content to use its influence to prevent any Senate amendments adding further new appropriations.The $2.85 billion measure comes on top of $1.1 billion appropriated after Hugo struck the Carolinas and Caribbean last month, and these totals don't reflect the additional benefit of low-interest disaster loans
The bill last night includes $500 million to help finance this credit and further raises the obligation ceiling for the Small Business Administration sixfold to $1.8 billion to accommodate the expected loan activity.In direct cash assistance, $1 billion is provided in federal highway construction funds, and $1.35 billion is divided between general emergency aid and a reserve to be available to the president to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters
In the Senate, Majority Whip Alan Cranston used his position to win not only the expanded credit but also more generous treatment than the House had permitted in the distribution of highway funds in the next six months.The emergency assistance wouldn't be counted against a state's normal allocation of annual highway funds, and the bill circumvents existing restrictions that otherwise would prevent the use of federal aid to repair a toll road, such as the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge damaged in last week's earthquake
The underlying stopgap bill is the second required by Congress this fall and, since the current fiscal year began Oct. 1, only the Energy and Interior departments are operating on permanent appropriations enacted into law.The standoff over abortion is certain to contribute to further delays and, apart from the health and education measure vetoed by Mr. Bush, bills funding the District of Columbia and the entire U.S. foreign-aid budget are in jeopardy because of related abortion or family-planning issues
The vote yesterday was the most partisan in many years, and though the Democratic leadership is ambivalent about how to address the abortion issue, the debate is increasingly measured in party terms.The 189 Democrats who supported the override yesterday compare with 175 who initially backed the rape-and-incest exemption two weeks ago and 136 last year on a similar vote. By comparison, Republicans have held closer to the anti-abortion movement.Only 42 GOP members opposed the president's veto, a marginal increase over the vote two weeks ago and just 12 more than the 30 who supported the rape-and-incest exemption last year

But after years of using the issue for its benefit, the GOP finds its candidates on the defensive.New Jersey gubernatorial candidate Rep. James Florio pointedly returned from campaigning to vote against the president yesterday in contrast with his opponent, GOP Rep. James Courter, who has ardently supported abortion restrictions in the past but was absent
In an extraordinary mix of cultures and church-state powers, Rep. Robert Dornan (R., Calif.) lectured his fellow Roman Catholics -- including Mr. Florio -- for having the "chutzpah" to disagree with the hierarchy of their church on abortion.Rep. Les AuCoin was as blunt on behalf of the abortion-rights movement

The Big Board this morning plans to begin trading its Exchange Stock Portfolio "basket" product, the first program-trading vehicle carrying the exchange's seal of approval.ESPs will allow institutional investors to buy or sell all 500 stocks in Standard & Poor's index in a single trade of a minimum of $5 million.

The Big Board lists its targets as pension plans, mutual fund managers and index-arbitrage traders.In index arbitrage, program traders buy and sell stocks and stock-index futures to profit from small price discrepancies between the markets
At the same time, only four securities firms have signed up with the Big Board to buy and sell ESPs as market makers, an unenthusiastic response.The market makers so far are CS First Boston Group's First Boston Corp. unit, Morgan Stanley & Co., PaineWebber Group Inc. and Salomon Inc. 's Salomon Brothers Inc. unit
major securities firms are reluctant to become market makers because they fear the baskets may attract only limited trading.only 25 contracts a day may trade at first, equivalent to a day's action at a small, regional exchange
With the futures locked into a trading halt Oct. 13 and trading in some individual stock difficult, program traders would have undoubtedly fled to the basket system.If we had the baskets, we would be leaving in caskets

Meanwhile, within the next few weeks, the limited partners in Ivan F. Boesky & Co. L.P. are expected to reach a partial settlement with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. regarding the distribution of the $330 million in partnership assets.Under the terms of the settlement, the limited partners would drop their civil suits against Drexel, now pending in federal court in New York
Attorneys involved in the talks said that the parties were closer to accord than they were a year ago.One individual said the shareholders' accord was "well worked out

The plaintiffs are investors who bought and sold securities in which Mr. Boesky and his partnerships were dealing.Some claim they suffered losses because they sold while he was buying and others because they bought while he was selling
There are at least 27 class-action shareholder suits that have been consolidated in federal court in New York under U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack.Among the defendants are Mr. Boesky; the now-defunct Ivan F. Boesky & Co.; Mr. Boesky's main underwriter, Drexel Burnham; and Cambrian & General Securities PLC, a British investment fund once controlled by Mr. Boesky
that "discussions are under way.There are no agreements yet
It has been three years since Mr. Boesky, now in prison, agreed to pay a $100 million fine to settle the government's charges that he had traded illegally using insider information.Out of this, the government set up a $50 million fund for plaintiffs who can prove their financial losses
Out of this, the government set up a $50 million fund for plaintiffs who can prove their financial losses.According to William Orbe, an attorney at Grais & Richards, the escrow agents for the fund, as of Sept. 30 the fund amounted to $60.5 million
Separately, attorneys for the 42 or so limited partners have had serious discussions that could lead to the distribution of the partnership's assets.The limited partners include insurance companies, financial institutions and individual investors
An agreement with Drexel regarding the limited partners' investments is an essential step toward getting their money back.This is because a Delaware court earlier this year said that Drexel is entitled to get its money back before or at the same time as the limited partners

Not everyone is worried, however.Some economists -- and many Japanese companies -- are puzzled by the warnings
Some economists -- and many Japanese companies -- are puzzled by the warnings.The investment boom is mainly sparked by strong domestic demand and isn't likely to increase exports sharply
Moreover, much investment isn't aimed at increasing capacity.According to a survey of some 2,400 large companies by the Japan Development Bank, expanded capacity is the goal of just 51.8% of the outlays; for manufacturers alone, the figure is 32%
According to a survey of some 2,400 large companies by the Japan Development Bank, expanded capacity is the goal of just 51.8% of the outlays; for manufacturers alone, the figure is 32%
for manufacturers alone, the figure is 32%.14.2% of their spending is designed to improve products or add new ones, 17.5% is to cut costs, 12.5% is for research and development, and the rest is for maintenance and other purposes
But the worriers remain unconvinced.With Japan running enormous trade surpluses against much of the world, they think that Japan should meet the increased domestic demand by importing more
And eventually, they contend, domestic demand will weaken, forcing companies to emphasize exports again. "If there's a further drive to export that'll be a problem
Japanese auto makers, for example, are increasing their production capacity in the U.S.; the additional production should, in part, replace imported vehicles with locally manufactured ones
In contrast to previous economic booms, Japanese auto companies aren't just trying to boost production.Many are pouring money into developing high-quality products to target affluent consumers and, to some extent, to avoid direct combat with cheaper cars from South Korea and Taiwan
Many are pouring money into developing high-quality products to target affluent consumers and, to some extent, to avoid direct combat with cheaper cars from South Korea and Taiwan.Others are replacing older facilities with flexible assembly lines on which different models can be turned out at once

at least partly by soaring domestic demand.Japan's marathon economy, growing at 4.3% this year, is now in its 35th month of expansion, and some economists are betting that the boom will outlast the record 57-month expansion in the late 1960s
Japanese consumers are increasingly eager to spend their money, especially on high-priced goods such as 29-inch television sets and luxury cars.Nissan Motor Co. 's domestic auto sales are up 20% this year largely because its expensive Cima, Sylvia and Cefiro models are in heavy demand
that if he had more cars, he'd sell them right away.that the company is trying to keep up with demand "by overworking" its employees
With demand growing and workers in short supply, many Japanese manufacturers are spending heavily on automation.Among them are the shipbuilders, which had halved their shipyard work forces to cut costs during a prolonged slump in demand but now are capturing an increased share of the strengthening global market

Once one Japanese company steps up its investments, the whole industry follows.to let a competitor's addition to capacity go unmatched is to concede defeat
The emphasis on market share is evident at Daikin Industries Ltd., Japan's biggest maker of industrial air conditioners.Seeing new office buildings sprout up and its sales soar, Daikin is building another plant, which will lift its production capacity 50%.The expansion is aimed not just at meeting demand but also at expanding the company's market share to 30% from 27% currently
Seeing new office buildings sprout up and its sales soar, Daikin is building another plant, which will lift its production capacity 50%.The expansion is aimed not just at meeting demand but also at expanding the company's market share to 30% from 27% currently
Besides, Daikin's major competitors, Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., "are all adding production lines.Until now, we were trying to increase productivity with the facilities we already had.But we can't produce enough anymore
The competition is even more heated in the auto industry, where companies are racing one another in a world-wide market.Nissan aims to expand its 25% share of the market to 30% by spending $141 million on a plant in southern Japan that could make as many as 240,000 cars a year
Nissan aims to expand its 25% share of the market to 30% by spending $141 million on a plant in southern Japan that could make as many as 240,000 cars a year.Meanwhile, Toyota Motor Corp.

Toshiba Corp., for example, is spending $986 million on two new plants to build four-megabit dynamic random access memories, the next generation of computer chips.but Toshiba, which has already beaten everyone else in producing the current-generation one-megabit DRAMs, believes that its early investment will heighten its chances of beating its competitors again

Meanwhile, Toshiba's Japanese rivals, Hitachi, Fujitsu Ltd. and NEC Corp., aren't sitting still.After doubling production in one plant, NEC is spending $275 million to build another plant that, in two years, will be able to make a million four-megabit DRAMs a year

Some of Japan's goods being produced as a result of the investment boom are already successful overseas.Toyota's $35,000 Lexus automobile, a luxury model that it started shipping to the U.S. only last month, is racking up orders at a time when U.S.-made luxury-car sales are slow

Except for a few spots, notably Georgia, Virginia and Michigan, failures declined almost across the board, according to the business information services company.D&B defines a business failure as a company that closes with losses to creditors
The current decline in failures continues a trend begun in late 1987, D&B said.The drop accelerated in this year's third quarter, underscoring an overall lack of stress in the U.S. economy
Failures in seven of nine regional areas fell more than 10% in the nine months.The South Atlantic States were the only region to report an increase in bankruptcies, up 5.3% to 5,791 from 5,502
The South Atlantic States were the only region to report an increase in bankruptcies, up 5.3% to 5,791 from 5,502.This occurred partly because of more competition as the number of new businesses surged
The only industry sector to report more business failures for the nine months was the finance, insurance and real-estate sector, where bankruptcies grew 8.1% to 2,046 from 1,892.The troubled savings-and-loan industry and subsequent stress in real-estate businesses fueled bankruptcies in this sector, D&B said

One day last March, CBS Sports President Neal Pilson and Olympics superagent Barry Frank met for lunch at the Lotos Club here.Mr. Frank told Mr. Pilson that Olympics officials wanted $290 million or more for TV rights to the 1994 Winter Games in Norway
Mr. Frank told Mr. Pilson that Olympics officials wanted $290 million or more for TV rights to the 1994 Winter Games in Norway.The CBS official said that price sounded fine
At that price, CBS was the only player at the table when negotiations with the International Olympic Committee started in Toronto Aug. 23.that ABC and NBC had refused to even bid

Mr. Pound responded, "It's a deal." A beaming Mr. Pilson announced his lastest coup at a news conference that afternoon
Mr. Pilson's rivals at ABC and NBC grimaced at the price.How could CBS get pushed into outbidding itself
With CBS Inc. on a spending spree that may top $2.5 billion for four years of major sports events, the new bout of hyperinflation could jolt the entire broadcast business.CBS itself could run up losses of a few hundred million dollars on four years of various sports if its big gamble goes wrong
While rights fees head skyward, ad rates won't.Advertisers already are balking at higher prices
Advertisers already are balking at higher prices. "The networks are paying too much for rights," warns adman Paul Isacsson of Young & Rubicam
The networks are paying too much for rights.If they ask advertisers to absorb the costs, they're likely to lose all but a few who need sports, above all
Viewers may not be cheering, either.Soaring rights fees will lead to an even greater clutter of commercials
Mr. Pilson emphasizes the ancillary benefits of positive press, contented affiliate stations, enthusiastic advertisers and huge audiences that might stick around to watch other CBS programs when the game is over.The billion-dollar question is, How much are those benefits worth
that CBS could run up.those deals can turn sour if the numbers don't work
CBS pursues top sports "to belie the fact that they aren't supporting affiliates, viewers and advertisers.They lost the entertainment crown, and they needed one.And they've bought one
On just three big deals -- for four years of baseball and for the Olympic Winter Games in both 1992 and 1994 -- Pilson bid a total of $1.64 billion.That's well over half a billion dollars more than ABC and NBC were willing to pay
That's well over half a billion dollars more than ABC and NBC were willing to pay. (After 1992, the winter and summer Olympics will be held two years apart, with the revised schedule beginning with the winter games in 1994 and the summer games in 1996
Now, Mr. Pilson -- a former college basketball player who says a good negotiator needs "a level offocus and intellectual attention" similar to a good athlete-s is facing the consequences of his own aggressiveness.Next month, talks will begin on two coveted CBS contracts, for the pro and college basketball finals.CBS is likely to spend whatever it takes to keep them.The potential bill: more than $600 million for several seasons, an 80% jump

Mr. Pilson is an unlikely big spender.In the mid-1980s he sniped at rivals for paying reckless prices
In the mid-1980s, after ABC had just bid a record $309 million for the 1988 Winter Games, he sniped at rivals for paying reckless prices. "I love Pilson, but he was the guy who complained most bitterly and loudly," says Robert Wussler, a former CBS Sports president
I love Pilson, but he was the guy who complained most bitterly and loudly," says Robert Wussler, a former CBS Sports president. "And yet his company is one reason why rights are so high today." Rivals carp at "the principle of Pilson," as NBC's Arthur Watson once put it -- "he's always expounding that rights are too high, then he's going crazy
But the 49-year-old Mr. Pilson is hardly a man to ignore the numbers.A Yale law school graduate, he began his career in corporate law and then put in years at Metromedia Inc. and the William Morris talent agency.In 1976, he joined CBS Sports to head business affairs and, five years later, became its president

And he isn't the only big spender: NBC will pay a record $401 million for the 1992 Summer Games
Our competitors say we overbid them.Who cares
Mr. Pilson's "Major Events" strategy jelled after Mr. Tisch took over.Mr. Pilson recalls that in April 1986, after CBS's annual meeting in Philadelphia, he and Mr. Tisch took the 90-minute train ride back to New York, and Mr. Pilson used this extended private audience to outline his ambitions.Mr. Tisch, a billionaire in hotels and finance, was just learning the TV business.Five months later, Mr. Tisch took over as CBS's chief executive, and soon he was wielding sole approval each time Mr. Pilson scribbled a frighteningly large figure on a slip of paper, sealed it in an envelope and gave it to sports negotiators. Then, in May 1988, Mr. Tisch urgently needed to make a bold statement to quell rumors that he might sell the network.Mr. Pilson gave him one: He bid $243 million for rights to the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville, France; ABC and NBC wouldn't bid even $200 million

It's also a fast fix for an ailing image.He sees flashy sports as the only way the last-place network can cut through the clutter of cable and VCRs, grab millions of new viewers and tell them about other shows premiering a few weeks later
He sees flashy sports as the only way the last-place network can cut through the clutter of cable and VCRs, grab millions of new viewers and tell them about other shows premiering a few weeks later.Next October, CBS, for the first time, won't have to start the season against the much-watched American and National baseball league championships and the World Series
I've been struggling against that for years.Even if baseball triggers losses at CBS I'd rather see the games on our air than on NBC and ABC

Moreover, sports is hardly the best way to lure adult women.most advertisers buy based on ratings for women aged 18 to 49
Though CBS might move up to No. 2 in household ratings, most advertisers buy based on ratings for women aged 18 to 49.CBS may remain a distant No. 3 in that regard
Nor is CBS a shoo-in to get blockbuster ratings.In recent years, the World Series and the Olympics were aired against CBS's last-place lineup.But CBS will put the athletes up against Bill Cosby, "Cheers" and other shows in NBC's No. 1 schedule

And avoiding such losses will take a monumental effort.On the $1.06 billion baseball agreement alone, CBS is likely to lose $250 million in four years
only that CBS will lose money on baseball in the first year. "It's too early to tell" what happens after that
Yet CBS will air only 12 regular-season games, 26 fewer than ABC and NBC.That has outraged some fans
CBS took to get an unprecedented lock on all playoff games.If the playoffs end in four-game sweeps, losses could soar
Advertisers are resisting higher prices.CBS signed General Motors and Toyota to be the only auto-maker sponsors in baseball for four years.Price: $265 million.But ad executives who negotiated the deal say that works out to only $275,000 for a 30-second ad in the World Series through 1993 -- 17% less than what ABC is charging for the Series this month
The Winter Games outlook also is mixed.CBS expects to make modest profits, but rivals contend that it will take a beating

And CBS takes in the least money in prime time; ABC and NBC charge 30% to 35% more for ads, according to a Variety survey

Although sports officials predict jumps of 50% to 100% in the major contracts coming up for renewal, ad rates may rise only 20%.CBS hopes to save money by ordering fewer episodes of regular series because sports will fill up a few weeks of prime time

When Mr. Pilson is asked directly -- can you make money on all this? -- he doesn't exactly say yes. "What you're really asking is, Are the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management?" he says
Yes, they are.That's the only question we need to address

IBM, which gets about half its revenue and more than half its profit from mainframes, also announced upgraded operating system software that, together with the new hardware, lets customers do so-called batch processing as much as 60% faster.Batch processing is the high-volume, single-job data processing that most mainframes typically chug through at night, such as updating accounts at banks

Analysts were disappointed that Digital's new line apparently won't contribute much to earnings before the next fiscal year.Jay Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said he may cut his earnings estimate for the current fiscal year because he had expected at least some mainframe profit this year
After the announcement yesterday, Digital shares gained $1.25 to close at $89.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.IBM shares closed at $103, down 50 cents, in Big Board trading

These products are the heart of our transmission-product line," Mr. Buchner said.He declined to disclose specific prices, but said each product costs in the tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of dollars
AT&T predicted strong growth in demand for such products.It noted that last July, Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. of Japan selected AT&T to supply $154 million of such equipment over a four-year period starting next year

Mr. Laff's attorney, John Lang, filed a memorandum asking that the trial record include a secretly taped conversation in which the witness, Henry Lorin, told a Haas stockbroker that Mr. Laff should be killed.The conversation was taped by federal investigators in what Mr. Lang said was an effort to get Mr. Lorin to implicate Mr. Laff
in what was an effort to get Mr. Lorin to implicate Mr. Laff.that Mr. Lorin was the "real master criminal" behind the stock manipulation, and that Mr. Laff knew nothing about it

The government has charged that Mr. Lorin and Mr. Laff were part of a conspiracy to maintain the prices of certain stocks at artificially high prices.Mr. Lorin, a stock promoter, pleaded guilty to the stock-manipulation charges in April and agreed to cooperate with the government's investigation of Mr. Laff
During his cross examination of Mr. Lorin, Mr. Lang read from the transcripts of a conversation that was taped Oct. 20, 1988.Stanley Aslanian, the Haas broker who agreed to carry a hidden microphone during the conversation, also has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities violations in the stock manipulation and agreed to cooperate
From the parts of the transcript read by Mr. Lang, it was unclear what exactly Mr. Lorin feared might happen.When asked for a copy of the transcript, Mr. Lang said Judge Thomas P. Griesa had instructed him not to release it or the memorandum
During the trial, Mr. Lang asked Mr. Lorin whether he had been so upset "that you considered killing Mr. Laff? . . . Isn't it true that you were so worked up that framing Mr. Laff for this crime was the least that you planned for him?" Mr. Lorin responded, "No
Mr. Lorin responded, "No." When Mr. Lang asked Mr. Lorin whether he had taken steps to have Mr. Laff killed, the witness again said no

Mr. Kageyama suggests that Kotobuki Electronics Industries workers were having difficulty understanding their foreign bosses' perspective.I question his perspective
Would he suggest that employees of an American company doing business in Japan conform to their new bosses' culture and philosophy?Obviously not
Thus the conclusion is that the burden rests with management to understand/adopt the culture and philosophy of the country in which they are operating.The workers can be motivated, and the company reach its full potential, only when management embraces the employees' perspective
A manager should not have to rebut the opinions of his employees about the style of his management.Instead, he should listen to see how that criticism can be used constructively to advance his objective of carrying out a set of tasks through the efforts of his subordinates.Japanese culture vs.American culture is irrelevant
Japanese culture vs.American culture is irrelevant.The key is how a manager from one culture can motivate employees from another
For Mr. Kageyama to argue that American employees must passively accept a direct imposition of the Japanese way of doing things is outright cultural chauvinism of the first order.The Japanese are neglecting the opportunity to synthesize a new corporate culture based on a fusion of the best aspects of both national cultures

As a presidential candidate in 1980, George Bush forthrightly expressed his position on abortion in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine published that March.What did he think of the Supreme Court's decision legalizing abortion? "I happen to think it was right," Mr. Bush said flatly
A few months later, Mr. Bush became Ronald Reagan's running mate.Suddenly, George Bush the pro-choice advocate became George Bush the anti-abortionist
But only four days after that, Mr. Bush resurrected the veto threat. "I do not support federal funding for abortions except where the mother's life is threatened," he proclaimed
So what does George Bush really believe?The answer is so murky that it is beginning to get this popular president in trouble with each of the increasingly vocal, increasingly powerful sides of the abortion issue
The answer is so murky that it is beginning to get this popular president in trouble with each of the increasingly vocal, increasingly powerful sides of the abortion issue.The result is mistrust and criticism from all around
Anti-abortion forces regard him as at best an uncertain ally. "In all honesty if you ask me, `Is this man a true believer? ' I don't know," says John Fowler, head of the Washington-based Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life Inc
Yet abortion-rights forces remain bitterly critical.Douglas Gould, vice president of communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, calls Mr. Bush's position on the abortion-funding issue "extremely cruel
The guy hasn't done one thing about prevention.He's totally geared to a punitive position
Mr. Bush is plainly uncomfortable with the entire abortion question.For most of the past nine years, he has striven to convince anti-abortion activists of his stalwart support for their position
Many Americans still agonize over their own personal feelings about abortion.Mr. Bush's problem isn't so much that he seems to be agonizing over the issue as it is that he seems to vacillate on it
as it is that he seems to vacillate on it.The political risk would be far less if the president drew a firm line and hewed to it
The political risk would be far less if the president drew a firm line and hewed to it.If you have a position, you're better off to stick with it than to move around very much
If you have a position, you're better off to stick with it than to move around very much.The need for consistency is especially acute for Mr. Bush, who lacks a strong ideological base
By his moderate Republican heritage as well as the warnings of political advisers who say the issue is vital to younger voters, the president might seem to have at least some sympathy with abortion-rights arguments.Yet he is also firmly bound by his hard-line rhetoric and promises he made to anti-abortion activists during his long pursuit of the White House.On many issues -- flag-burning, for instance -- his keen political sensitivities overcome such conflicts
These days, when others raise the subject of abortion, the usually loquacious president can be close-mouthed almost to the point of curtness.Ten days ago he was asked to amplify the reasons behind his anti-abortion stance. "My position is well-known and well-stated," he replied
Ten days ago he was asked to amplify the reasons behind his anti-abortion stance. "My position is well-known and well-stated," he replied
In his Rolling Stone interview in 1980, Mr. Bush volunteered his abortion-rights remarks to contrast himself with his rival, Ronald Reagan.In addition to supporting the landmark Roe vs.Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, Mr. Bush said he opposed the constitutional ban on abortion that Mr. Reagan was promising to promote
As Mr. Reagan's running mate, though, Mr. Bush plunged headlong into the anti-abortion position, endorsing a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion.He acknowledged only one difference with Mr. Reagan -- that the amendment ought to have exceptions for rape and incest as well as to save a woman's life
In 1974, as the U.S. representative to the United Nations, he wrote an introduction to a book on world population in which he boasted of his leadership during his term in Congress in expanding family-planning services for the poor.Running for president in early 1980, he was also quoted as supporting federal funding for abortions in cases of rape, incest and to save the life of the mother.In April 1986, then-Vice President Bush had his staff write a letter spelling out that he would support a constitutional amendment banning abortions except in cases of rape, incest and life endangerment, but that he opposed federal funding in all but the latter case
In 1974, as the U.S. representative to the United Nations, he wrote an introduction to a book on world population in which he boasted of his leadership during his term in Congress in expanding family-planning services for the poor.Running for president in early 1980, he was also quoted as supporting federal funding for abortions in cases of rape, incest and to save the life of the mother.At the GOP convention last year, he again came out for an amendment with exceptions for rape, incest and life endangerment
affirming his "firm support of our cause" during an anti-abortion rally three days after his inauguration last January.He again urged passage of a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion
the president began to lower the volume.When the ruling was handed down, the vacationing president dispatched Chief of Staff John Sununu to issue a statement and refused to answer questions himself
But in the months since then he has shied away from talking about abortion.What few comments he has initiated have been oblique
which anti-abortion forces had regarded as a key test of their ability to get state lawmakers to toughen abortion restrictions.The session failed to enact any new curbs
Now, some see Mr. Bush trapped in a position he is neither comfortable with nor able to escape.Ken Ruberg, head of the Republican Mainstream Committee, a group of party moderates, observes: "The administration finds itself in an ideological cul de sac that it will find it difficult -- if not impossible -- to get itself out of
Christopher Cox's Oct. 13 editorial-page article "Toward More Crippling Lawsuits . . ." misses the point.The 1989 Americans With Disabilities Act is about eliminating discriminatory barriers
it is clear that our constitutionally mandated civil rights have evolved not through the goodness of people's hearts but through legislation and constitutional amendments.This is how American women won the right to vote
For the more than 43 million Americans with disabilities, the 1989 Americans With Disabilities Act provides the missing piece.Disabled Americans have had their civil rights guaranteed in all federally funded programs since Section 504 was passed as a part of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act.The 1989 act simply extends these guarantees to the private sector

Donald DeScenza, an independent analyst in New Canaan, Conn., said he was "impressed with the company's performance." He said results were better than he'd expected and indicate that Goodyear is in the midst of a turnaround from a string of lackluster quarters that have plagued the company for a year

steel profits were close to a cyclical peak.Though imports were troublesome, they weren't running away with the market
Though imports were troublesome, they weren't running away with the market, and American companies had high hopes that steel import quotas would be extended for another five years.Perhaps most important, Carl Icahn was subdued
Perhaps most important, Carl Icahn, who had once threatened a hostile takeover bid, was subdued.He and Mr. Roderick were even dining out together
whose fortunes have changed abruptly.Mr. Icahn, the company's deep-pocketed, tenacious adversary, recently disclosed that he had raised his USX stake to 13.1%, and he again threatened a takeover
Mr. Icahn, the company's deep-pocketed, tenacious adversary, recently disclosed that he had raised his USX stake to 13.1%, and he again threatened a takeover.A battle with Mr. Icahn would rattle even the most seasoned chief executive, to say nothing of one who took the helm less than five months ago

Mr. Icahn, the company's deep-pocketed, tenacious adversary, recently disclosed that he had raised his USX stake to 13.1%, and he again threatened a takeover.A battle with Mr. Icahn would rattle even the most seasoned chief executive, to say nothing of one who took the helm less than five months ago. In addition, USX's giant steel segment, representing 34% of its 1988 sales, is facing softening demand and slipping prices as well as increasing competition from foreign steelmakers and low-cost minimills.The import quotas got only a 2 1/2-year extension, and USX is laboring under a staggering $5.8 billion debt at a time when it must spend money to upgrade steel mills and drill for oil. "It's a baptism of fire for Corry
without being pushed into unwelcome moves.Mr. Corry might have to dismember the company more than he wants to
With his recent purchases of USX common stock, Mr. Icahn shattered a three-year-old, unwritten standstill agreement with Mr. Roderick.In 1986, Mr. Roderick adroitly dodged Mr. Icahn's first bullet after the takeover specialist had built up an 11.4% stake
In 1986, Mr. Roderick adroitly dodged Mr. Icahn's first bullet after the takeover specialist had built up an 11.4% stake.Mr. Roderick did so by having USX redeem a series of guaranteed notes, a move that, in effect, raised the cost of a $7.19 billion Icahn bid by about $3 billion
and even strike up an unlikely friendship with the interloper.Over dinners at New York's Sky Club and Links Club restaurants, the steel executive and the big investor talked steel, international trade and thoroughbred horses
Mr. Corry, who has boned up on corporate raiders by reading T. Boone Pickens's autobiography, had hoped the detente would continue.He was shocked to learn of Mr. Icahn's new takeover threat
He was shocked, associates say, to learn of Mr. Icahn's new takeover threat. (Both men declined to be interviewed for this article
But the fiercely competitive Mr. Corry quickly showed he's no pushover.He huddled with directors at a special meeting two weeks ago and tried to block his opponent
Now, it's Mr. Icahn's move.Will he try to gain a seat on or control of the board and force a radical split of USX into separate oil and steel companies
Will he try to gain a seat on or control of the board and force a radical split of USX into separate oil and steel companies?Given the weakness of the junk-bond market, can he finance a buy-out
Given the weakness of the junk-bond market, can he finance a buy-out?Mr. Icahn may not want to sell out unless he can get a special dividend similar to one he received before selling his stake in Texaco Inc. in June -- a coup that gave him enough cash to make his USX move
it doesn't end the takeover threat. "I know it's not over," a sober-faced Mr. Corry acknowledged
In fact, it's barely begun for Mr. Corry, who faces tough decisions before he has had a chance to get settled into his new job. "He's in a vulnerable position because he hasn't established much credibility on his own
The 57-year-old tax attorney never even aspired to the job of chief executive.An undistinguished college student who dabbled in zoology until he concluded that he couldn't stand cutting up frogs, Mr. Corry wanted to work for a big company "that could do big things
But after joining the tax department of a USX subsidiary 30 years ago, he set the modest goal of becoming tax manager by the age of 46.For years, he quietly stuck to the back accounting rooms
wearing a hat to work because everyone else did. "I was never a rebel
I was never a rebel.I don't think most of the people that have been around me would ever say they've seen me pound the table or get angry
Yet, the unassuming Mr. Corry helped chart USX's transition from Big Steel to Big Oil.He served as Mr. Roderick's front man in tense negotiations for the 1982 purchase of Marathon Oil for $5.9 billion
Nevertheless, Mr. Corry, once named chief executive, didn't waste any time distancing himself from his former boss.Soon after taking over last June, Mr. Corry rescinded a pay cut imposed on clerical workers, a move that Mr. Roderick hadn't made in spite of improved earnings
And, earlier this month, he announced the sale of the reserves of Texas Oil & Gas, which was acquired three years ago and hasn't posted any significant operating profits since.One former executive says, "Nobody wanted that deal inside USX except Dave Roderick," who was a hunting and fishing buddy of William L. Hutchison, chairman of Texas Oil & Gas
One former executive says, "Nobody wanted that deal inside USX except Dave Roderick," who was a hunting and fishing buddy of William L. Hutchison, chairman of Texas Oil & Gas.The executive recalls Mr. Corry whispering to him and others, "Remember, this was Dave's deal
But when the two men met in New York a day after Mr. Icahn disclosed the rise in his USX stake, Mr. Corry learned that Mr. Icahn wanted him to sell all of Texas Oil -- not just its reserves of about 1.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 28 million barrels of oil but also its pipeline, gas-gathering and contract-drilling operations.That would leave USX with Marathon, its steel mills and its diversified business segment, which includes, among other things, mineral and transportation products
that Mr. Corry would agree if he could find a buyer at the right price.The problem is that Mr. Icahn is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring USX than Mr. Corry had planned
in restructuring USX.Mr. Icahn has long believed that the company, whose 1988 sales totaled $16.88 billion, is worth $70 a share if broken up
Mr. Icahn has long believed, associates say, that the company, whose 1988 sales totaled $16.88 billion, is worth $70 a share if broken up.The stock closed yesterday at $33.625, giving Mr. Icahn's 33.6 million shares a value of $1.13 billion
and Mr. Corry doesn't necessarily disagree.Unlike his predecessor, who saw steel as America's backbone, Mr. Corry tends to view it as a capital-draining and labor-intensive business with limited potential
as a capital-draining and labor-intensive business with limited potential.In the past five years, USX has turned steel into a profit maker by closing several plants and reducing labor costs.But the short-term outlook is so-so
It isn't surprising that Messrs.Roderick and Corry view steel so differently.While Mr. Roderick was reared in the shadows of Pittsburgh's smoking mills, Mr. Corry grew up in Cincinnati, a city nicknamed "Porkapolis" and more accustomed to pork chops than pig iron
While Mr. Roderick was reared in the shadows of Pittsburgh's smoking mills, Mr. Corry grew up in Cincinnati, a city nicknamed "Porkapolis" and more accustomed to pork chops than pig iron.He has never met Lynn Williams, the president of the United Steelworkers union
Having two major products would lessen the company's vulnerability to one market's down cycle and help smooth out the flow of cash and earnings.We're a two-product company and, boy, if you can't figure out the value of those two parts, you are so damn dumb that you don't belong on Wall Street
Moreover, the opportunity to sell steel at a price acceptable to USX may be gone, for now. "The time has passed for us to spin off steel," either in a public offering or to a buyer, one executive contends
The time has passed for us to spin off steel," either in a public offering or to a buyer.About the only way that USX now can get out of steel is to dish it out, piece by piece, in separate joint ventures
With Mr. Icahn breathing down his neck, however, Mr. Corry may have little choice but to sell at a weak price, even if it means losing some steel-related tax-loss carryforwards.That would leave USX essentially an oil company with Marathon as its core
That would leave USX essentially an oil company with Marathon as its core.Marathon has benefited from higher crude-oil prices and strong demand for refined products
However, even USX executives who work closely with him aren't sure about his long-term goals. "I don't think he has a clear sense of where he wants the company to go," one says
he has a clear sense of where he wants the company to go.Right now he wants to continue to focus on paying down" USX's debt by selling assets

In what amounts to an admission that the transition hasn't gone as smoothly as Sears had hoped, the giant retailer is now trying new ways to drum up business without appearing to abandon its seven-month-old strategy.The company is highlighting more special deals in its advertising and stores, and it's offering to defer finance charges on certain big-ticket items
In a new TV ad, for instance, a woman going through the Sunday newspaper brands as hype claims by other stores that they are offering goods for "50%, 60% and 70% off." By lowering prices throughout its stores Sears has the right idea
But the ad also mentions Sears's sales.When Sears has a sale at a special price," the woman in the ad declares, "it's something you don't want to miss

Its government still wants to sit in the driver's seat, set the speed, step on the gas, apply the brakes and steer, with 120 million people in the back seat.In a modern system, the government's role is to give the people as much choice as possible and to keep them well informed so they are capable of making a choice

And the Ministry of Foreign Affairs works for itself, supporting Japanese diplomats who sprinkle abundant aid money around the world to ensure that their seat at the dinner table is next to the host's.This ministry has done nothing to correct the misunderstandings and misperceptions that are at the root of Japan's deteriorating image
All this illustrates that Japanese ministries still have a "provider" mentality; they do not serve the people, and particularly not consumers

Criticism from such big advertisers as Estee Lauder Inc., Colgate-Palmolive Co. and Seagram Co. put a damper on the euphoria at the American Magazine Conference here.The conference opened Monday with glowing reports about consumer magazines' growth in circulation and advertising revenue in the past year
Magazines are not providing us in-depth information on circulation.How do readers feel about the magazine
How deeply do they read it?Research doesn't tell us whether people actually do read the magazines they subscribe to
advertisers lack detailed demographic and geographic breakdowns of magazines' audiences. "We need research that convinces us that magazines are a real value in reader's lives, that readers are really involved

Few people are aware that the federal government lends almost as much money as it borrows.From 1980 to 1988, while federal budget deficits totaled $1.41 trillion, the government issued $394 billion of new direct loans and an additional $756 billion of new primary loan guarantees

and budget gimmicks and deceptive management in particular.As we will see, many of these obligations don't show up as part of the federal deficit

Student loan defaults remain high at about 12%, and the program has been rocked by allegations of fraud and mismanagement.Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) loans have turned into de facto giveaway programs; losses over the next three years are expected to exceed $20 billion.Defaults on Veterans Affairs loan guarantees have quadrupled in the past eight years
Last month, the General Accounting Office reported that defaults in Federal Housing Administration guarantees were five times as high as previously estimated, and that FHA's equity fell to minus $2.9 billion.GAO's findings are particularly troubling because the FHA has about $300 billion in obligations outstanding and had previously been considered one of the most financially secure credit programs
Scores of other credit programs, subsidizing agriculture, small business, exporters, defense, energy, transportation and others, are less visible but in no better shape.If the programs continue their present path, the potential government losses are staggering: The federal government holds $222 billion in direct loans outstanding and backs an additional $550 billion in primary guarantees

The federal government holds $222 billion in direct loans outstanding and backs an additional $550 billion in primary guarantees. (Secondary guarantees of pools of FHA- and VA-backed loans by the agency known as Ginnie Mae currently exceed $330 billion
Although external events have contributed to the morass, the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs.To reduce the risks while still retaining the legitimate benefits these programs can provide, credit policy must: 1.Use credit to improve the operation of capital markets, not to provide subsidies
There is a fundamental conflict between providing a subsidy and maintaining the integrity of a credit program.If the program is meant to provide a subsidy, collecting the debt defeats the original goal
Thus, subsidized loans tend to turn into giveaway programs, with increasing subsidy and default rates over time.To avoid this problem, government should issue credit only if it intends to use every legal method to collect
For example, legal restrictions on interstate banking once inhibited the supply of credit to the agricultural sector.Farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a reliable flow of lendable funds
For example, student loans currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and mitigate problems created by the fact that students' future earnings are not accepted as collateral.The program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount
The program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount.High default rates, a low interest rate, and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high
High default rates, a low interest rate, and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high.Families that do not need the loan can make money simply by putting the loan in the bank and paying it back when the student graduates
In contrast, a student loan program that was meant solely to correct capital-market imperfections would allow loans for any student, regardless of family income, at market or near-market rates.While the student was in school, interest costs would either be paid by the student or added to the loan balance
While the student was in school, interest costs would either be paid by the student or added to the loan balance.This program, combined with cash grants to needy students, would reduce program costs and much more effectively target the intended beneficiaries
Given the structure of most credit programs, it is surprising that default rates are not even higher.Guarantee rates are typically 100%, giving lenders little reason to screen customers carefully
Guarantee rates are typically 100%, giving lenders little reason to screen customers carefully.Reducing those rates moderately (say, to 75%) would still provide substantial assistance to borrowers
Borrowers' incentives are equally skewed.Since the government has a dismal record of collecting bad debts, the costs to the borrower of defaulting are usually low
Since the government has a dismal record of collecting bad debts, the costs to the borrower of defaulting are usually low.In addition, it is often possible to obtain a new government loan even if existing debts are not paid off.Simple policy prescriptions in this case would be to improve debt collection (taking the gloves off contracted collection agencies) and to deny new credit to defaulters
Simple policy prescriptions in this case would be to improve debt collection (taking the gloves off contracted collection agencies) and to deny new credit to defaulters.These provisions would be difficult to enforce for a program intended to provide a subsidy, but would be reasonable and effective devices for programs that attempt to offset market imperfections
Since the budget measures cash flow, a new $1 direct loan is treated as a $1 expenditure, even though at least part of the loan will be paid back.Loan guarantees don't appear at all until the borrower defaults, so new guarantees do not raise the deficit, even though they create future liabilities for the government
Loan guarantees don't appear at all until the borrower defaults, so new guarantees do not raise the deficit, even though they create future liabilities for the government.By converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee, the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit
By converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee, the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit.Predictably, guarantees outstanding have risen by $130 billion since 1985, while direct loans outstanding have fallen by $30 billion
The true budgetary cost of a credit subsidy is the discounted value of the net costs to government.This figure could be estimated using techniques employed by private lenders to forecast losses, or determined by selling loans to private owners (without federal guarantees
This figure could be estimated using techniques employed by private lenders to forecast losses, or determined by selling loans to private owners (without federal guarantees).Neither technique is perfect, but both are better than the current system, which misstates the costs of new credit programs by amounts that vary substantially and average about $20 billion annually, according to the Congressional Budget Office
but both are better than the current system.A budget that reflected the real costs of lending would eliminate incentives to convert spending or lending programs to guarantees and would let taxpayers know what Congress is committing them to

The administration of federal credit should closely parallel private lending practices, including the development of a loan loss reserve and regular outside audits.Establishing these practices would permit earlier identification of emerging financial crises, provide better information for loan sales and budgeting decisions, and reduce fraud
Government lending was not intended to be a way to obfuscate spending figures, hide fraudulent activity, or provide large subsidies.The reforms described above would provide a more limited, but clearer, safer and ultimately more useful role for government as a lender

The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted to keep the promise of the Fifteenth Amendment and enable Southern blacks to go to the polls, unhindered by literacy tests and other exclusionary devices.Twenty-five years later, the Voting Rights Act has been transformed by the courts and the Justice Department into a program of racial gerrymandering designed to increase the number of blacks and other minorities -- Hispanics, Asians and native Americans -- holding elective office
In the 1980s, the Justice Department and lower federal courts that enforce the Voting Rights Act have required state legislatures and municipal governments to create the maximum number of "safe" minority election districts.The program has even been called upon to create "safe" white electoral districts in municipalities where whites are the minority

Insisting that they are protected by the Voting Rights Act, a group of whites brought a federal suit in 1987 to demand that the city abandon at-large voting for the nine member City Council and create nine electoral districts, including four safe white districts.The white group argued that whites were not fully and fairly represented, because in city-wide elections only black candidates or white candidates who catered to "black interests" could win

The Justice Department has distributed these new guidelines for U.S. Attorneys prosecuting RICO cases.A related editorial appears today
Under {RICO}, the government may seek a temporary restraining order (TRO) upon the filing of a RICO indictment, in order to preserve all forfeitable assets until the trial is completed and judgment entered.Such orders can have a wide-ranging impact on third parties who do business with the defendants, including clients, vendors, banks, investors, creditors, dependents, and others

Some highly publicized cases involving RICO TROs have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press, because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process.In order to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected, the Criminal Division has instituted the following requirements to control the use of TROs in RICO prosecutions
In order to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected, the Criminal Division has instituted the following requirements to control the use of TROs in RICO prosecutions. (It should be noted that these requirements are in addition to any other existing requirements, such as review by the Asset Forfeiture Office
As part of the approval process for RICO prosecutions, the prosecutor must submit any proposed forfeiture TRO for review by the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section.The prosecutor must show that less-intrusive remedies (such as bonds) are not likely to preserve the assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction
In deciding whether forfeiture (and, hence, a TRO) is appropriate, the Section will consider the nature and severity of the offense; the government's policy is not to seek the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant's crime

Probably the most clear-cut Soviet violation, for example, is the Krasnoyarsk radar. -- "Arms Control Reality," Nov. 20, 1984, the first of some 20 Journal editorials saying that Krasnoyarsk violated the ABM treaty
Thus we judge it to be not a violation of the ABM treaty at this time." The delegation included a reporter from the New York Times, aides to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and Rep. Les AuCoin, and Natural Resources Defense Council staff members
We're happy, we guess, to receive confirmation of the Krasnoyarsk violation from the Soviets, five years after we started writing about it.Perhaps even the American apologists will now accede
Without question, something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the Politburo.the Soviet government has recognized it has a credibility problem
It's not enough.If the Soviets want to be believed, they need to start telling the truth about more than the totally obvious
If the Soviets want to be believed, they need to start telling the truth about more than the totally obvious.Our own test of "glasnost's" authenticity would be a Soviet decision to open itself to a complete international examination of one of the most troubling mysteries in U.S.-Soviet relations -- the reported 1979 anthrax outbreak at a Soviet military facility in Sverdlovsk
The U.S. government has never waivered in its assessment of this incident as an accident at a biological weapons facility there.The Pentagon's recently issued "Soviet Military Power repeated the Sverdlovsk assessment
Since Mr. Shevardnadze did not address this topic before the Supreme Soviet, the Soviet Union's official position remains that the anthrax deaths were caused by tainted meat.We doubt this claim just as we doubted Mr. Shevardnadze's assurance last year that Krasnoyarsk didn't violate the ABM treaty
The Soviets' explanation is that the anthrax came from one lot of animal feed made from the bones of cattle that grazed on soil that was naturally infected with anthrax spores.Harvard's Matthew Meselson -- who we read has sold something called the "scientific community" on the notion that "yellow rain" attacks on the Laotian Hmong were in fact the result of fecal showers by giant bees -- found the Soviet anthrax scenario "completely plausible
And we certainly do not believe that Mr. Gorbachev or any of his emissaries yet deserve to have the West take their word for it.Sverdlovsk is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms-control process itself
The U.S. government's Sverdlovsk complaint, as with Krasnoyarsk, is no mere political posturing.Biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate, and indeed have not been pressed vigorously enough by the U.S. government
The Soviets should be willing to set in motion a process that would allow them to acknowledge that Sverdlovsk violated the 1972 agreement or, alternatively, that would give U.S. specialists reasonable confidence that this was a wholly civilian accident.Until that happens, glasnost cannot begin to deserve the kind of credibility Mr. Shevardnadze was bidding for with his confessions on Monday

and the issue forced a confrontation between the Appropriations Committee leadership and Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, whose California district was at the center of the earthquake last week.Going to the well of the chamber, Mr. Panetta demanded the costs be fully counted
Going to the well of the chamber, Mr. Panetta demanded the costs be fully counted.His prominent role put him in the awkward position of challenging the very committee members on whom his state will be most dependent in the months ahead
We do not come to this House asking for any handout.We do not intend to hide these costs from the American people
The $2.85 billion package incorporates $500 million for low-interest disaster loans, $1 billion in highway construction funds, and $1.35 billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to President Bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters.The funds are in addition to $1.1 billion appropriated last month to assist in the recovery from Hugo
But the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal 1991.Within the appropriations process, the situation is even more difficult
and this urgency has contributed to the speed -- and, critics say, mistakes -- that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance.The hastily drafted measure could hurt California by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required
but both the White House and Congress appear most anxious to speed final approval before tonight's deadline.Administration pressure discourages any effort to add to total funding
and making severe cuts from Pentagon requests for installations abroad.An estimated $25.8 million is allocated to continue work in Oman
Closer to home, the negotiators were more generous.An estimated $38.9 million was set aside for military installations in the home state of North Carolina Rep. W.G. Hefner, the House chairman
And $70.2 million would go to projects in Tennessee represented by his Senate counterpart and fellow Democrat, Sen. James Sasser.Texas and California are traditionally powerful within the conference, but equally striking is the dominance of Alaska, Pennsylvania and West Virginia because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process
but equally striking is the dominance of Alaska, Pennsylvania and West Virginia because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process.Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) even added report language listing $49.4 million in projects he wants in the budget next year
No individual illustrated this mix of power more yesterday than Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii), who chairs the Senate defense subcommittee.In the final trading, the House was insistent on setting aside $500 million to carry out base closings ordered to begin in fiscal 1990
But it gave ground to Mr. Inouye on a number of projects, ranging from a $11 million parking garage here, to a land transfer in Hawaii, to a provision to assist the Makwah Indian Tribe in Washington state.The tribe is one of the poorest in the Pacific Northwest
Meanwhile, House-Senate negotiators have tentatively agreed on a $3.18 billion anti-drug and anti-crime intitiative, cutting other federal spending 0.43% to pay for it.A formal House-Senate conference is expected to ratify the accord later this week
Employees haven't yet been notified.Sources said that meetings to discuss the staff reductions have been scheduled for Friday at Mobil offices in New Orleans and Denver
This would be a second round of cuts by Mobil.Mobil's latest move could signal the beginning of further reductions by other oil companies in their domestic oil-producing operations
In yesterday's third-quarter earnings report, the company alluded to a $40 million provision for restructuring costs involving U.S. exploration and production operations.The report says that "the restructuring will take place over a two-year period and will principally involve the transfer and termination of employees in our U.S. operations
that Mobil is reducing its U.S. work force because of declining U.S. output.domestic exploration and production operations had a $16 million loss in the third quarter
Industrywide, oil production in this country fell by 500,000 barrels a day to 7.7 million barrels in the first eight months of this year.Daily output is expected to decline by at least another 500,000 barrels next year
Some Mobil executives were dismayed that a reference to the cutbacks was included in the earnings report before workers were notified.One Mobil executive said that the $40 million charge related to the action indicates "a substantial" number of people will be involved

Justice is attempting to avoid a replay of these tactics.This amounts to an extraordinary repudiation of the tenure of New York mayoral candidate and former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani

that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process." It told prosecutors not to seek forfeitures if there are "less intrusive" alternatives, such as bonds, and in any case not to seek forfeitures "disproportionate to the defendant's crime

for the firm, the liquidation was sentence first, verdict later.Prosecutors wanted $23.8 million in forfeiture for alleged tax fraud of some $400,000
Drexel therefore agreed instead to an arrangement allowing it to plea to charges "which the company is not in a position to dispute" because of RICO. Part of Drexel's plea was to cut Mr. Milken loose
So two cheers for the new rules.Justice has finally recognized its employees' abuses, thanks largely to the demands for reform by former U.S. attorney in Washington Joseph diGenova, who wants to salvage RICO for real criminals
But prosecutorial guidelines are effective only if someone at Justice is willing and able to supervise hyperactive prosecutors.Judge Sentelle, of the appeals court in Washington, made this point at a Cato Institute conference last week in a remarkable speech titled, "RICO: The Monster That Ate Jurisprudence
Judge Sentelle, of the appeals court in Washington, made this point at a Cato Institute conference last week in a remarkable speech titled, "RICO: The Monster That Ate Jurisprudence." He said ours is supposed to be "a government of laws not of men," and yet RICO defenders "tell us that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect against overbreadth of RICO
and yet RICO defenders "tell us that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect against overbreadth of RICO." No prosecutorial guidelines, observed or unobserved, limit civil RICO cases by plaintiffs for damages
Justice should review these cases to see what other prosecutorial abuses may have occurred.We suspect that Justice will some day agree that only the complete repeal of RICO can guarantee an end to injustices in its name

for a change there actually was a conductor in the pit whom we wanted to hear, Carlos Kleiber, trying to make memorable music while we all waited for the bed lump to stir into song.Once she did so, the big-souled German maestro with the shaky nerves who so often cancels offered a limpid, flowing performance that in its unswagged and unswaggering approach was totally at odds with the staging
and whether this has to do with Mr. Kleiber or the wooden cast is hard to say.In any event, Ms. Gruberova barely ventilated Violetta's anguish in her long meeting with Wolfgang Brendel

But since the time of Darwin, we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our species.Aren't we, after all, the inevitable culmination of that stately pageant called evolution
Now along comes Stephen Jay Gould to dash this flattering illusion.His credentials are excellent for the task
His credentials are excellent for the task.Star lecturer at Harvard, author of numerous popular books on science, and scourge of the creationist lobby, Mr. Gould is perhaps the world's most eminent evolutionary theorist
Yet he puts quite a twist on the old story handed down from Darwin.For him, natural history is anything but a gradual, predictable march from primordial slime to human consciousness
For him, natural history is anything but a gradual, predictable march from primordial slime to human consciousness; it is a careening, chaotic affair in which the emergence of a featherless biped was a one-in-a-million shot
In "Wonderful Life: The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History" (Norton, 326 pages, $19.95), Mr. Gould makes his case for "the awesome improbability of human evolution." The argument turns on the discovery in 1909 of an amazing fossil quarry high in the Canadian Rockies called the Burgess Shale
The argument turns on the discovery in 1909 of an amazing fossil quarry high in the Canadian Rockies called the Burgess Shale.Here, in an area smaller than a city block, lay buried traces of countless weird creatures that had frolicked more than 500 million years ago -- creatures whose anatomical variety far exceeded what can be found in all the world's oceans today
Such an embarrassment of riches was inconceivable to the man who discovered the Burgess Shale, one Charles Doolittle Walcott.The received Darwinian wisdom of the day said that animals living so long ago must be simple in design, limited in scope and ancestral to contemporary species
It was not until the early 1970s that Cambridge Prof.Harry Whittington and two sharp graduate students began to publish a reinterpretation of the Burgess Shale.By making clever inferences about how the squashed and distorted fossil remains corresponded to three-dimensional structures, this trio was able to piece together a series of wondrous beasties quite unlike anything currently on the planet
a series of wondrous beasties quite unlike anything currently on the planet.One was so fantastic in appearance, it was dubbed Hallucigenia
Would that Mr. Gould's minute descriptions of these creatures was always so colorful.A good deal of the book is boring, particularly the endless allusions to high and pop culture and the frequent jokes festooning the text
A good deal of the book is boring, particularly the endless allusions to high and pop culture and the frequent jokes festooning the text.These turns do not provide sufficient relief from sentences like, "Most modern chelicerates have six uniramous appendages on the prosoma
Interest picks up, though, when Mr. Gould gets around to discussing the meaning of the Burgess oddities for the theory of evolution.Not long after the appearance of life, evidently, there was an explosive proliferation in the number of animal designs seen on the earth
Consequently, the winnowing process was like a lottery "in which each group {held} a ticket unrelated to its anatomical virtues." So much for survival of the fittest
So much, too, for the notion that we humans triumphed in the Darwinian struggle by evolving big brains.Our mammalian forerunners lucked out through the extraterrestrial impact that did in the dinosaurs because they were small, not smart

In one, birds are the dominant carnivores; in another the seas abound with "little penises
Back when the Burgess fauna were flourishing, it seems, human evolutionary hopes hung on the survival of a little worm with a backbone called Pikaia.Mr. Gould finds this oddly exhilarating
Mr. Gould finds this oddly exhilarating; like an existentialist of old, he views our contingency as "a source of both freedom and consequent moral responsibility

The guidelines were distributed to U.S. attorneys last summer but were disclosed for the first time by press reports this week.They discourage prosecutors, under certain circumstances, from seeking court orders seizing the assets of racketeering defendants prior to trial
Use of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law against white-collar defendants, as opposed to alleged organized-crime figures, has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars.that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before a jury determines they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can ruin corporate defendants or force them into unfavorable plea bargains
Mr. Runkel declined to speculate on whether the guidelines would curb racketeering prosecutions against corporate defendants. "The impact, if there is any, will be impossible to judge ahead of time because the decision whether to use {racketeering charges} is made in individual cases" by Justice Department officials in Washington
The talk of a sales tax rise follows a rebuff from Congress on the question of how much the federal government is willing to spend to aid in California's earthquake relief efforts.The state had sought as much as $4.1 billion in relief
That leaves the state roughly $2 billion to $4 billion short.A sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and easiest to raise funds in a hurry
A sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and easiest to raise funds in a hurry.According to the state department of finance, a one-penny increase in the state's six-cent per dollar sales tax could raise $3 billion
One immediate source of money is an emergency fund set up by Gov. Deukmejian.The fund has about $1 billion and is set up to handle "precisely the kind of emergency" the state faces, said Tom Beermann, the Governor's deputy press secretary
But observers expect broad support. "If there's an emergency and there aren't sufficient funds from elsewhere, I think the attitude will be supportive," said Kirk West, president of the California Chamber of Commerce
But others think property owners ought to pay a higher portion of the state's earthquake relief tab.Since the late 1970s, California property owners have benefited from a tax rollback as a result of a state ballot initiative known as Proposition 13
Not everyone is convinced the state must raise new revenue to meet its earthquake needs. "It's possible, though not probable," that the state could get by with its existing resources and federal help, said Quentin Kopp, chairman of the state senate's transportation committee

When the Trinity Repertory Theater named Anne Bogart its artistic director last spring, the nation's theatrical cognoscenti arched a collective eyebrow.Ms. Bogart, an acclaimed creator of deconstructed dramatic collages that tear into such sacred texts as Rodgers and Hammerstein's "South Pacific," is decidedly downtown
She held her fire with her first production at the Trinity earlier this season.It was a predictable revival of her prize-winning off-Broadway anthology of Bertolt Brecht's theoretical writings, called "No Plays, No Poetry
Now, with the opening of Maxim Gorky's bourgeois-bashing "Summerfolk," Ms. Bogart has laid her cards on the table.Hers is a hand that will test the mettle of her audiences
And "Summerfolk is a lawn party of Russian yuppies engaged in an exhausting ideological fight to the finish between the allrightniks and the reformers.Along the way there also are lots of romantic dalliances
Wisely Ms. Bogart has kept Gorky's time and place intact.Despite the absence of samovars (and a tendency to turn the furniture upside down), the production is rich in Russian ennui voiced by languorous folk sporting beige linen and rumpled cotton, with boaters and fishing poles aplenty
But beyond this decorative nod to tradition, Ms. Bogart and company head off in a stylistic direction that all but transforms Gorky's naturalistic drama into something akin to, well, farce.The director's attempt to force some Brechtian distance between her actors and their characters frequently backfires with performances that are unduly mannered
The director's attempt to force some Brechtian distance between her actors and their characters frequently backfires with performances that are unduly mannered.Not only do the actors stand outside their characters and make it clear they are at odds with them, but they often literally stand on their heads
Like Peter Sellars, Ms. Bogart manipulates her actors as if they were rag dolls.There are moments in this "Summerfolk" when the characters populating the vast multilevel country house spout philosophic bon mots with the self-conscious rat-a-tat-tat pacing of "Laugh In

The clash of ideologies survives this treatment, but the nuance and richness of Gorky's individual characters have vanished in the scuffle.As for the humor that Gorky's text provides, when repainted in such broad strokes (particularly by the lesser members of the ensemble) it looks and sounds forced
Ms. Bogart does better with music than with words when she wants, as she so often does want, to express herself through Gorky's helpless play.Here she has the aid of her longtime associate Jeff Helpern, whom she appointed Trinity's first-ever musical director and whom she equipped with a spanking new $60,000 sound system and recording studio
Here she has the aid of her longtime associate Jeff Helpern, whom she appointed Trinity's first-ever musical director and whom she equipped with a spanking new $60,000 sound system and recording studio.For Gorky, Mr. Helpern provided an aural collage of Debussy and Rachmaninoff, which is less a score than a separate character with a distinct point of view
that her fondest artistic wish was to find a way to play "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" so that the song's "original beauty comes through.The danger that Ms. Bogart seems to be courting here is one of obfuscation rather than rejuvenation

MORGAN STANLEY, THE ONCE STODGY investment house, in 1974 helped a corporate client complete a hostile takeover.It was the start of a boom in unfriendly, even ungentlemanly, mergers
On July 18, 1974, International Nickle of Canada -- advised by Morgan -- offered $28 a share, equal to $157 million, for ESB, a Philadelphia battery maker.ESB said it was given only a three-hour advance warning on a "take it or leave it" basis from Inco, as the Toronto company is called
Hostile" thus entered the merger-acquisition lexicon.Joseph Flom, of Skadden, Arps, Slote, Meagher & Flom, which became a leading legal firm in merger cases, said the case "made takeovers respectable
ESB spurned Inco and within five days ESB had a "white knight" as United Aircraft -- headed by Harry Gray, a shrewdly friendly acquirer of companies -- offered $34 a share.Gray was advised by Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch
but a whirlwind bidding match ensued.Within a few days in July, Inco raised its bid to $36 and United matched it
Within a few days in July, Inco raised its bid to $36 and United matched it.On a single day Inco lifted its offer to $38 and then to $41, equal to $225.5 million

HomeFed had been one of the handful of large West Coast thrifts that in recent quarters had counteracted interest-rate problems dogging the industry by keeping a lid on problem assets and lending heavily into the furious California housing market.Analysts had been projecting fully diluted earnings in the third quarter in the range of about $1.30 a share
Meanwhile, non-performing assets rose to $593 million from $518.7 million.Some $380 million of the troubled assets is repossessed real estate, a 55.6% surge from the $244.2 million of repossesed property HomeFed held a year ago

about half are in California, with the rest scattered across the country.It said sales of such properties were slower than anticipated in the third quarter, but it expects sales to pick up in the rest of the year
HomeFed said the slide in loan originations was more a matter of design than a sign of cooling in the California market.Any such downturn in California would be grim news for West Coast thrifts, particularly the less healthy ones, which have performed poorly even with a torrid market
it purposely curbed loan originations in the quarter because of uncertainty over the new capital requirements and regulations that will emerge from negotiations over implementing the government's massive thrift bailout bill.It said its real-estate operations earned a record $21.7 million, more than double year-earlier real estate profit of $9 million
earnings also were nicked in the quarter by a $4 million provision for losses associated with its previously reported plan to liquidate a real-estate franchise network.For the nine months, HomeFed earned $82.5 million, or $3.52 a fully diluted share, a 4.3% increase from year-earlier net income of $79.1 million, or $3.43 a fully diluted share

Because of shrinkage in the economy, rates can be expected to decline over a one-year horizon.It's unclear how much rates can fall and how soon
Changes in CD yields in the week ended Tuesday were in line with blips up and down within a fairly narrow range for the last two months.Interest rates generally began declining last spring after moving steadily upward for more than a year

At first UAL didn't open because of an order imbalance.When it did a half-hour into the session, it was priced at $150 a share, down more than $28 from Monday's close
When it did a half-hour into the session, it was priced at $150 a share, down more than $28 from Monday's close.It sank further to as low as $145
but a big rally developed in the last half hour, pushing the stock back up to close at $170, down just $8.375 from Monday.In the process, 4.9 million shares traded, making UAL the second most active issue on the Big Board
But we like to call it 'controlled chaos, '" said 47-year-old Robert J. Jacobson Jr., grandson of the firm's founder.He manned the UAL post yesterday with Christopher Bates, 33, an energetic Long Islander who's a dead ringer for actor Nicolas Cage
Options traders, arbitrage traders -- everyone.There were some pretty bad losses in the stock
a 200,000-share buy order at $150 a share entered by Bear, Stearns & Co is what set off the UAL crowd in the late afternoon.A subsequent rally in UAL helped the staggering stock market stage an astonishing recovery from an 80-point deficit to finish only slightly below Monday's close

The news told them it would be a while longer before UAL resumed trading like a regular airline stock after months of gyrations.When Mr. Jacobson walked into the office at 7:30 a.m. EDT, he announced: "OK, buckle up
and immediately spotted trouble.Already entered in the Big Board's computers and transmitted to their post were sell orders for 65,000 UAL shares

UAL, which closed on the Big Board Monday at $178.375 a share, traded in the third market afterward as low as $158 a share.There were rumors of $148-a-share trades
And at 9:15, they posted a $135 to $155 "first indication.That range was quickly narrowed to $145 to $155
When UAL finally opened a half hour late, some 400,000 shares traded at $150.There was "selling pressure from everyone

On that earlier day, the stock's trading was halted at a critical time so the specialists could catch their breath.Not yesterday
But yesterday, the heavy trading action eventually consumed not only Messrs.Jacobson and Bates but four other Jacobson partners.About 30 floor traders crammed near the UAL post most of the day
About 30 floor traders crammed near the UAL post most of the day, and probably hundreds more came and went -- a "seething mass," as one trader described it.The 4.9 million-share volume flowing through the Jacobson specialist operation was about five times normal for the stock
The Bear Stearns order that marked the late-day turnaround caused a "massive buying effort" as UAL jumped $20 a share to $170 in the last half hour.With 15 seconds of trading to go, Mr. Jacobson announced to the trading mob: "We're going to trade one price on the bell
We're going to trade one price on the bell." That meant no trading would occur in the final seconds
Big Board traders praised the Jacobson specialists for getting through yesterday without a trading halt.In Chicago, a UAL spokesman, "by way of policy," declined to comment on the company's stock or the specialists' performance

As a result, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government isn't currently expected to ease interest rates before next spring, if then.Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson views the high rates as his chief weapon against inflation
which was ignited by tax cuts and loose credit policies in 1986 and 1987.Officials fear that any loosening this year could rekindle inflation or further weaken the pound against other major currencies
Mr. Lawson said inflation "remains the greatest threat to our economic well-being" and promised to take "whatever steps are needed" to choke it off.The latest government figures said retail prices in September were up 7.6% from a year earlier
Many economists have started predicting a mild recession next year.David Owen, U.K. economist with Kleinwort Benson Group, reduced his growth forecast for 1990 to 0.7% from 1.2%
Still, Britain's current slump is a cause for concern here.Compared with the major economies on the Continent, the U.K. faces both higher inflation and lower growth in the next several months
But while September exports rose to #8.43 billion, imports shot up to #10.37 billion.The resulting #1.9 billion merchandise trade deficit was partly offset by an assumed surplus of #300 million in so-called invisible items
Despite the narrowing of the monthly trade gap, economists expect the current account deficit for all of 1989 to swell to about #20 billion from #14.6 billion in 1988.the big deficit reflects the slipping competitive position of British industry

The problems were uncovered during a series of internal investigations of the company's Space Systems division, which has been the focus of two separate overcharge prosecutions by the government since 1985.The dispute stems from pretrial maneuvering in the pending court case, in which prosecutors have been demanding access to a host of internal company memos, reports and documents
The dispute stems from pretrial maneuvering in the pending court case, in which prosecutors have been demanding access to a host of internal company memos, reports and documents.Last November, a federal grand jury indicted GE on charges of fraud and false claims in connection with an alleged scheme to defraud the Army of $21 million on a logistics computer contract
The company, for its part, maintains that many of the disputed documents are privileged attorney-client communications that shouldn't be turned over to prosecutors.A hearing is scheduled on the issue today
The government's 136-page filing covers events leading up to the current case and an earlier indictment in March 1985, when GE was accused of defrauding the Pentagon by illegally claiming cost overruns on Minuteman missile contracts.GE pleaded guilty and paid a fine of more than $1 million in the Minuteman case, which involved some of the same individuals and operations that are at the center of the dispute in the Philadelphia court

Nevertheless, on Capitol Hill lawmakers said they are worried that financial institutions are routinely discriminating against minorities.They asked regulators to suggest new ways to force banks and thrifts to comply with anti-discrimination laws
The data is a red flag, but lacking the financial data you can't make a case that discrimination is widespread.Certainly the federal government should take a hard look at it

Time is also fighting the transaction on other fronts, by attempting to discourage other cable operators from joining Tele-Communications as investors in Showtime, cable-TV industry executives say.Time officials declined to comment
Last week, Tele-Communications agreed to pay Viacom Inc. $225 million for a 50% stake in its Showtime subsidiary.Tele-Communications, the U.S.'s largest cable company, said it may seek other cable partners to join in its investment
Tele-Communications is HBO's largest customer, and the two have a number of other business relationships.Earlier this year, Time even discussed bringing Tele-Communications in as an investor in HBO

Time is expected to mount a legal challenge in U.S. District Court in New York, where Viacom in May filed a $2.5 billion antitrust suit charging Time and HBO with monopolizing the pay-TV business and trying to crush competition from Showtime.it is now preparing a countersuit naming both Viacom and Tele-Communications as defendants
it is now preparing a countersuit naming both Viacom and Tele-Communications as defendants.Time may seek to break up the transaction after it is consummated, or may seek constraints that would prevent Tele-Communications from dropping HBO in any of its cable systems in favor of Showtime
Viacom officials declined to comment.Jerome Kern, Tele-Communications' chief outside counsel, said he wasn't aware of Time's legal plans
In addition to owning HBO, with 22 million subscribers, Time Warner separately operates cable-TV system serving about 5.6 million cable-TV subscribers.Tele-Communications controls close to 12 million cable subscribers, and Viacom has about one million

Together, they control nearly 40% of Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc.; Tele-Communications has a 21.8% stake, while Time Warner has a 17.8% stake
But since Time's merger with Warner Communications Inc., relations between the two have become strained.Each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too vertically integrated
and other developments are weakening Viacom's antitrust suit against Time.Viacom accuses Time in its suit of refusing to carry Showtime or a sister service, The Movie Channel, on Time's Manhattan Cable TV system, one of the nation's largest urban systems.But yesterday, Manhattan Cable announced it will launch Showtime on Nov. 1 to over 230,000 subscribers

several major carriers have posted or are expected to post relatively poor third-quarter results.Yesterday, USAir Group Inc posted a worse-than-expected $77.7 million net loss for the period
And they say the outlook for 1990 is nearly as bad.Airlines in 1989 "came in like a bang and are going out like a whimper
This turn of events has put a big damper on an industry that seemed almost invincible last spring, when fares were rising at double-digit rates and many carriers seemed to be growing fat on near-monopolies in certain markets.Now, many airline companies might become a lot less attractive as takeover targets on Wall Street
Now, many airline companies might become a lot less attractive as takeover targets on Wall Street.The downturn also raises questions about the carriers' ambitious orders for new airplanes
For travelers, though, the industry's problems have had some positive effects.In recent weeks, airlines have cut numerous fares in leisure markets to try to win back customers
In recent weeks, airlines have cut numerous fares in leisure markets to try to win back customers.Others have tried to spruce up frequent-flier programs
Just last week, for example, Trans World Airlines and Pan Am Corp. 's Pan American World Airways went so far as to offer cash rebates or gift checks of $200 to $1,000 to certain frequent-flier members making trans-Atlantic flights in business class or first class.The industry's slowdown became apparent this month when AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, reported an 8.8% drop in third-quarter net income and said its fourth quarter would be "disappointing
The industry's slowdown became apparent this month when AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, reported an 8.8% drop in third-quarter net income and said its fourth quarter would be "disappointing." Shortly before that, USAir had said its third-quarter results would be "significantly lower" than a year earlier
its third-quarter results would be "significantly lower" than a year earlier.Its loss of $77.7 million, or $1.86 a share, contrasted with net of $68.5 million, or $1.58 a share, in the 1988 third quarter.Revenue rose only 3.3% in the latest period, to $1.53 billion from $1.48 billion

The results surprised many analysts, because USAir has almost no competition in its Pittsburgh hub and has expanded operations by completing its acquisition of Piedmont Airlines.Shortly after announcing its quarterly loss, USAir's stock tumbled $3 a share
Shortly after announcing its quarterly loss, USAir's stock tumbled $3 a share.It ended at $40.125, down $2.375, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
Nobody was expecting this size of a loss.One airline executive called the loss "amazing
In announcing the results, USAir cited many of the same problems that several other industry officials have named recently.It said the industry's domestic traffic was flat in the third quarter
this was because hefty fare increases earlier in the year scared off many leisure travelers this summer.To try to combat the traffic slowdown, airlines started reducing fares
To try to combat the traffic slowdown, airlines started reducing fares; average fares rose only 1.7% in August, in contrast to increases of 16% each in February and March
Some other fare promotions have backfired.This summer, the industry introduced a "kids fly free" program, in which children were allowed to fly free if they were traveling with an adult
This summer, the industry introduced a "kids fly free" program, in which children were allowed to fly free if they were traveling with an adult.Airlines tried to restrict the program substantially by limiting the offer to certain days of the week, but it still was apparently used far more heavily than the airlines expected
Airlines also say their frequent-flier programs are squeezing profits because awards are being redeemed at a heavier-than-normal rate.One airline official said about three times as many free-travel coupons are being turned in as in previous years
Rising operating expenses are another problem.Fuel costs were up 10% in the third quarter
Fuel costs were up 10% in the third quarter.Labor costs are on the upswing again at many carriers
USAir, for example, blamed some of its loss on merger expenses and on disruptions caused by Hurricane Hugo last month. "We cannot quantify the total adverse effects of Hugo

Takeover-stock traders, stung by their huge losses in UAL stock, remained eager for some action by an outside catalyst following the collapse Oct. 13 of a $300-a-share, $6.79 billion labor-management buy-out.Their hope was that the catalyst would seek to oust the board in a solicitation of shareholder consents

The pilots are working under an expired contract, and the machinists contract expires next month.That gives them enormous leverage, including the threat of a strike to block any buy-out or recapitalization attempt they oppose
However, a catalyst like Coniston could seek shareholder support for a sale to a labor-management group at the last price discussed by that group before the board meeting Monday.The pilots had been working on a buy-out bid between $225 and $240 a share, or $5.09 billion to $5.42 billion

SCI TV, which expects to release a plan to restructure $1.3 billion of debt in the next day or so, isn't just another LBO that went bad after piling on debt -- though it did do that.The cable and TV station company was an LBO of an LBO, a set of assets that were leveraged twice, enabling the blue-chip buy-out king Henry Kravis in 1987 to take more than $1 billion of cash out of the com- pany
SCI TV's six stations once were part of Storer Communications.KKR loaded up the cable and television company with debt in an 1985 buy-out
In 1987, KKR for the second time piled debt onto Storer's TV stations, selling them for $1.3 billion to a new entity that was 45%-owned by KKR and 55%-owned by Gillett Corp.In this second LBO, KKR with one hand took more than $1 billion of cash out of the TV company's assets and moved it into the Storer cable operations, making them more valuable in a 1988 sale
So, while KKR today has an estimated $250 million sunk in now-shaky SCI TV, including equity and debt, the LBO firm still is $1 billion ahead on the SCI TV buy-out after taking cash up front.On Storer as a whole, KKR racked up compound annual returns of 60% in the three years it owned Storer
Meanwhile, Mr. Gillett risks losing his entire equity investment of about $100 million in SCI TV if the company can't be restructured.Overall, Mr. Gillett's holding company, Gillett Holdings, is heavily indebted and, except for its Vail Mountain resorts, isn't doing very well
SCI TV's grace period for paying its bills is due to expire Nov. 16.It now is quietly circulating among creditors a preliminary plan to restructure debt
It now is quietly circulating among creditors a preliminary plan to restructure debt.Negotiations "have started con- structively, but that's not to say we like this particular offer," says Wilbur Ross of Rothschild Inc., adviser to SCI TV junk-holders
that Mr. Kravis is disappointed that Mr. Gillett didn't manage to boost SCI TV's operating profit after the buy-out.Mr. Kravis apparently thinks SCI TV can survive if lenders extend its debt payments until TV stations rise in value again, allowing SCI TV to sell assets to pay debt
Mr. Kravis apparently thinks SCI TV can survive if lenders extend its debt payments until TV stations rise in value again, allowing SCI TV to sell assets to pay debt.Mr. Gillett is said to be proud of his operating record; he has lifted some stations' ratings and turned around a Detroit station
As for junk-holders, they're discovering it can be a mistake to take the other side of a trade by KKR.The bonds of SCI TV now are being quoted at prices ranging from only five cents to about 60 cents on the dollar, according to R.D. Smith & Co. in New York, which trades distressed securities
it offers concessions by KKR and Gillett Corp.They would both give part of their combined $50 million in common equity in SCI TV to holders of SCI TV's $488 million of junk bonds, as a carrot to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company
But some militant SCI TV junk-holders say that's not enough.They contend that SCI TV's equity now is worthless
that SCI TV's equity now is worthless.They add that it isn't costing KKR anything to give up equity because of its big up-front cash profit on the buy-out
They add that it isn't costing KKR anything to give up equity because of its big up-front cash profit on the buy-out, which they think contributed to SCI TV's current problems.Kemper, the biggest holder of senior SCI TV bonds, has refused to join the bond-holders committee and is said to be reviewing its legal options
To protect their claims, some junk-holders want KKR and perhaps Mr. Gillett to invest new money in SCI TV, perhaps $50 million or more.One investment banker who isn't involved in the deal says SCI TV needs at least $50 million of new equity to survive
The threat of bankruptcy is a legitimate tool" to extract money from KKR.This could be the first major bankruptcy-law proceeding for KKR
This could be the first major bankruptcy-law proceeding for KKR, he adds.A big bankruptcy-court case might tarnish KKR's name, and provide new fuel for critics of LBOs in Washington and elsewhere

In the experiment, mice with the defective gene were mated.Three days later, before the new embryo had become implanted in the uterus, it was washed out of the mother mouse
Three days later, before the new embryo had become implanted in the uterus, it was washed out of the mother mouse.The embryo had progressed only to a clump of eight identical cells
The embryo had progressed only to a clump of eight identical cells.One cell was teased out, and its DNA extracted
Using the new technique developed by Cetus Corp., called the polymerase chain reaction, the scientists rapidly made millions of copies of the section of DNA that ordinarily contains the hemoglobin gene, providing enough copies to test.A genetic probe showed the hemoglobin gene was missing
For example, infertile couples who have the woman's eggs fertilized in the test tube usually have several eggs fertilized at a time.When the fertilized cells divide to eight cells, a single cell from each embryo can be tested for genetic defects

In the early 1970s, when the "world food crisis" was a major worry, Phillips Petroleum Co., like several other big companies, began developing "single-cell protein," edible protein made by microbes feeding on non-edible materials.Phillips found and improved a yeast, "Pichia pastoris," which made protein from natural gas-derived alcohol
It also could convert glucose from farm wastes into edible protein.Single-cell protein never panned out, and most companies abandoned such research
But Phillips persisted, calling in scientists from the Salk Institute.They've now adapted the yeast to making genetically engineered drugs
They've now adapted the yeast to making genetically engineered drugs.Like the bacteria used by genetic engineers, the yeast can take in human genes and churn out human proteins for medical use

It relies on the fact that certain atoms give off detectable signals when subjected to an intense magnetic field.It's the same phenomenon used in the new MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanners being used in hospitals in place of X-ray scans
In the Bell Labs experiments, an MRI-type of machine, synchronized with the heartbeat via an electrocardiogram, rapidly flashes a magnetic field on and off as blood passes a certain point in a vessel.The rapidly flashing return signals from excited hydrogen atoms in the blood give a "stop-motion" movie of the blood-filled vessel, (like the "stop-motion" seen in disco dancers when a strobe light is flashing)

In an Oct. 10 editorial-page article, "It's the World Bank's Turn to Adjust," Paul Craig Roberts lays most of the blame for what ails developing countries at the doorstep of the World Bank.The article is, unfortunately, replete with outrageous distortions
One of Mr. Roberts's observations is that the Bank's own loan portfolio is in deep trouble because of its lending to developing countries.This is just not so
This is just not so.The reality is that Bank finances are rock solid
The reality is that Bank finances are rock solid.As of June 30, 1989 -- the day our past fiscal year came to a close -- only 4.1% of the Bank's portfolio was affected by arrears of over six months
As of June 30, 1989 -- the day our past fiscal year came to a close -- only 4.1% of the Bank's portfolio was affected by arrears of over six months.This is an enviably low level
Moreover, the Bank follows a prudent provisioning policy and has set aside $800 million against possible loan losses.For the same fiscal year, by the way, the Bank's net income was a robust $1.1 billion after provisions
Because of the business-like manner in which the Bank goes about development, financial markets have confidence in it.This helps explain the triple-A rating enjoyed by our bonds and our ability to borrow $9.3 billion in fiscal 1989 on the most advantageous terms
Another of Mr. Roberts's criticisms is that Bank lending has done more harm than good "by implanting the wrong incentives and deflecting energy away from economic development." Here, too, Mr. Roberts is way off the mark
Here, too, Mr. Roberts is way off the mark.The reality is that Bank loans have been linked to policy improvements for 40 years
Our traditional project loans have, for instance, supported sensible energy pricing in the power sector, sound interest-rate policies in the credit area and the operation of public utilities as efficient, autonomous agencies.By and large, these efforts have borne fruit
By and large, these efforts have borne fruit.In my home region, Latin America, much of the existing infrastructure base -- an important building block for development -- has been financed by the World Bank
Mr. Roberts also takes a swipe at the Bank's adjustment lending.What are the facts on this type of lending
What are the facts on this type of lending?The Bank has been making adjustment loans for 10 years
The Bank has been making adjustment loans for 10 years.As their name implies, these operations are linked to far-reaching policy reforms that aim at helping borrowing countries get back on the growth path and at enhancing their credit-worthiness
As their name implies, these operations are linked to far-reaching policy reforms that aim at helping borrowing countries get back on the growth path and at enhancing their credit-worthiness.Typically, these measures include reforms to downsize the role of government and parastatals in the economy, to open up inward-looking economies to international competition and to promote the development of a vigorous private sector

The agency has concluded that contamination may be widespread throughout the mushroom-processing industry in China.The agency won't allow mushrooms that were canned or packed in brine at any Chinese plant to enter the U.S. until "satisfactory sanitation-control measures are implemented in China to prevent" bacterial contamination
On May 19, the FDA began detaining Chinese mushrooms in 68-ounce cans after more than 100 people in Mississippi, New York and Pennsylvania became ill from eating tainted mushrooms.In subsequent tests, the agency found smaller-size cans from several Chinese plants to be similarly contaminated
The outbreaks were traced to staphylococcus aureus, a type of bacteria that produces a toxin capable of surviving the high temperatures used in canning vegetables.A recall of the mushrooms blamed for the food poisoning began in early March
In 1987, China exported 65 million pounds of mushrooms, valued at $47 million, to the U.S.The shipments went mostly to food-service distributors that supply pizzerias and restaurants

the divergence between the stock and bond markets is a sign of growing unease about the economic outlook.A sinking economy depresses corporate earnings and thus stock prices, but it buoys bond prices as interest rates fall
That unease is expected to grow today when the government reports on September durable goods orders and again Thursday when the first assessment of third-quarter economic growth is released.durable goods orders fell about 1%, compared with a 3.9% gain in August, and that growth in the third quarter slowed to about 2.3% from the second quarter's 2.5

The Wall Street Journal "American Way of Buying" Survey consists of two separate, door-to-door nationwide polls conducted for the Journal by Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization.The two surveys, which asked different questions, were conducted using national random probability samples
The poll conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates interviewed 2,064 adults age 18 and older from June 15 to June 30, 1989.The poll conducted by the Roper Organization interviewed 2,002 adults age 18 and older from July 7 to July 15, 1989
The poll conducted by the Roper Organization interviewed 2,002 adults age 18 and older from July 7 to July 15, 1989.Responses were weighted on the basis of age and gender to conform with U.S. Census data
For each poll, the odds are 19 out of 20 that if pollsters had sought to survey every household in the U.S. using the same questionnaire, the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than 2 1/2 percentage points in either direction.The margin of error for subgroups -- for example, married women with children at home -- would be larger
Ironically, American Airlines' attempt to lead industry prices higher was reported in the same issue as your survey showing that consumers had the least confidence in the airline industry (Sept. 20).You quote Robert Crandall, chairman of American's parent, AMR Corp., as having said that discount deals for big customers would be "dumb" because "you will go to Detroit because you have to go to Detroit whether the fare is $175, $275 or $375

He heads Litigation Sciences Inc., the nation's largest legal consulting firm, which is helping corporate America prepare for high-stakes litigation by predicting and shaping jurors' reactions.In the process, Litigation Sciences is quietly but inexorably reshaping the world of law

Twenty-one of its workers are Ph.D.s.Among other services, the firm provides pre-trial opinion polls, creates profiles of "ideal" jurors, sets up mock trials and "shadow" juries, coaches lawyers and witnesses, and designs courtroom graphics
Much like their cohorts in political consulting and product marketing, the litigation advisers encourage their clients to play down complex or ambiguous matters, simplify their messages and provide their target audiences with a psychological craving to make the desired choice.With jury verdicts getting bigger all the time, companies are increasingly willing to pay huge sums for such advice
Recently, Litigation Sciences helped Pennzoil Co. win a $10.5 billion jury verdict against Texaco Inc.It advised the National Football League in its largely successful defense of antitrust charges by the United States Football League

Litigation consulting is highly manipulative.The notion they try to sell is that juries don't make decisions rationally
But the effort is also being made to try and cause jurors not to decide things rationally.I find it troubling
that consultants can be very effective. "It's gotten to the point where if the case is large enough, it's almost malpractice not to use them
that the consultants' growing influence exacerbates the advantage of litigants wealthy enough to afford such pricey services. "The affluent people and the corporations can buy it, the poor radicals {in political cases} get it free, and everybody in between is at a disadvantage, and that's not the kind of system we want
Sophisticated trial consulting grew, ironically, from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases.The Harrisburg 7 trial in 1972, in which Daniel Berrigan and others were charged with plotting anti-war-related violence, was a landmark
In that case, a group of left-leaning sociologists interviewed 252 registered voters around Harrisburg.The researchers discovered that Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Methodists and fundamantalist Protestants were nearly always against the defendants
The defense also learned that college-educated people were uncharacteristically conservative about the Vietnam War.A more blue-collar panel became a second aim
Ultimately, that carefully picked jury deadlocked with a 10-2 vote to acquit, and the prosecution decided not to retry the case.Litigation consulting had arrived

They, or at least something less efficient than today's thin-walled units, may soon be making a comeback.That something, whatever it is, could add as much as $100 to the $600 or so consumers now pay for lower-priced refrigerators
These and other expensive changes in products ranging from auto air conditioners to foam cushioning to commercial solvents are in prospect because of something called the Montreal Protocol, signed by 24 nations in 1987.In one of the most sweeping environmental regulatory efforts to date -- involving products with an annual value of $135 billion in the U.S. alone -- the signatories agreed to curtail sharply the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs

That's a lot of banishment, as it turns out.CFCs are the primary ingredient in a gas, often referred to by the Du Pont trade name Freon, which is compressed to liquid form to serve as the cooling agent in refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment

Gases containing CFCs are pumped into polyurethane to make the foam used in pillows, upholstery and insulation.Polyurethane foam is a highly efficient insulator, which accounts for why the walls of refrigerators and freezers can be thinner now than they were back in the days when they were insulated with glass fiber
But even though by some estimates it might cost the world as much as $100 billion between now and the year 2000 to convert to other coolants, foaming agents and solvents and to redesign equipment for these less efficient substitutes, the Montreal Protocol's legions of supporters say it is worth it.that CFCs are damaging the earth's stratospheric ozone layer, which screens out some of the sun's ultraviolet rays
Peter Teagan, a specialist in heat transfer, is running a project at Arthur D. Little Inc., of Cambridge, Mass., to find alternative technologies that will allow industry to eliminate CFCs.In addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has extensively studied the related topic of global warming, a theory that mankind's generation of carbon dioxide through increased combustion of fossil fuels is creating a "greenhouse effect" that will work important climatic changes in the earth's atmosphere over time
I would be the first to admit that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems.In the kind of literature I read I come across countervailing opinions quite frequently
But the nature of the problem is such that many others feel it has to be addressed soon, before all the evidence is in.We can't afford to wait
But does it have to be so soon.that even if CFCs were released into the atmosphere at an accelerating rate, the amount of ozone depletion would be only 10% by the middle of the next century
that even if CFCs were released into the atmosphere at an accelerating rate, the amount of ozone depletion would be only 10% by the middle of the next century.It's easy to get something comparable by simply moving to a higher altitude in the U.S
Moreover, there are questions, particularly among atmospheric scientists who know this subject best, about the ability of anyone to know what in fact is happening to the ozone layer.It is generally agreed that when CFCs rise from earth to stratosphere, the chlorine in them is capable of interfering with the process through which ultraviolet rays split oxygen molecules and form ozone
and the importance of human-generated CFCs in reducing it is largely a matter of conjecture.The ozone layer is constantly in motion and thus very hard to measure
The ozone layer is constantly in motion and thus very hard to measure.What scientists have known since the late 1970s is that there is a hole in the layer over Antarctica that expands or contracts from year to year
Another argument of the environmentalists is that if substitutes are available, why not use them?Mr. Teagan cites a list of substitutes but none, so far, match the nonflammable, nontoxic CFCs
Moreover, new lubricants will be needed to protect compressors from the new formulations, which, as with CFCs, are solvents.as well that if the equipment designed to get along without CFCs is less efficient than current devices, energy consumption will rise and that will worsen the greenhouse effect
Mr. Teagan points out as well that if the equipment designed to get along without CFCs is less efficient than current devices, energy consumption will rise and that will worsen the greenhouse effect.Folks in the Midwest who just suffered a mid-October snowstorm may wonder where the greenhouse was when they needed it, but let's not be flippant about grave risks
As it happens, Arthur D. Little is not at all interested in throwing cold water on ozone depletion and global warming theories.It is interested in making some money advising industry on how to convert to a world without CFCs
It is interested in making some money advising industry on how to convert to a world without CFCs.There is, after all, big money in environmentalism
Maybe we should ask why it was that Du Pont so quickly capitulated and issued a statement, giving it wide publicity, that it was withdrawing CFCs.Freon, introduced in 1930, revolutionized America by making refrigeration and air conditioning practical after all
and are trying instead to cash in on them, although they never care to put it quite that way.Du Pont, as it happens, has a potential substitute for CFCs
Imperial Chemical Industries of the U.K. also has one, and is building a plant in Louisiana to produce it.Japanese chemical companies are at work developing their own substitutes and hoping to conquer new markets, of course
There are still others who don't mind seeing new crises arise.Environmental groups would soon go out of business were they not able to send out mailings describing the latest threat and asking for money to fight it

In other words, environmentalism has created a whole set of vested interests that fare better when there are many problems than when there are few.That tends to tilt the public debate toward "solutions" even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the seriousness of the threats and the insistence of urgency

City officials feared widespread gridlock on the first day that normal business operations were resumed following last Tuesday's earthquake.The massive temblor, which killed at least 61 people, severed the Bay Bridge, a major artery to the east, and closed most ramps leading to and from Highway 101, the biggest artery to the south
The massive temblor, which killed at least 61 people, severed the Bay Bridge, a major artery to the east, and closed most ramps leading to and from Highway 101, the biggest artery to the south.It will take several weeks to repair the bridge, and several months to repair some of the 101 connections
mainly because the Bay Area Rapid Transit subway system carried 50% more passengers than normal.For the first time in memory, it was standing-room only in BART's sleek, modern railcars
Many commuters who normally drove across the Bay Bridge actually may have reached work a bit faster on BART yesterday, provided they could find a parking space at the system's jammed stations.In the best of times, the Bay Bridge is the worst commute in the region, often experiencing back-ups of 20 to 30 minutes or more
Not that getting into town was easy.Storm flooding caused back-ups on the freeway, and many commuters had to find rides to BART's stations, because parking lots were full before dawn

Bechtel Group Inc., the giant closely held engineering concern, says it has instituted a 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. flextime arrangement, whereby employees may select any eight-hour period during those hours to go to work.Of Bechtel's 17,500 employees, about 4,000 work in San Francisco -- one-third of them commuting from stricken East Bay

Well, mankind can rest easier for now.Though almost everybody at the playing site had been looking for the 26-year-old Soviet to beat the Pennsylvania-based computer, he gave the machine a far worse drubbing than many expected
And when Mr. Kasparov strode into the playing hall, he called the outcome.As if he were Iron Mike, about to enter the ring with a 98-pound weakling, he declared: "I'll be able to beat any computer for the next five years
a thorough study of dozens of its games including its notorious whippings of the grandmasters Bent Larsen of Denmark and Robert Byrne of the U.S. Mr. Kasparov was underwhelmed
Mr. Kasparov was underwhelmed. "The computer's mind is too straight, too primitive," lacking the intuition and creativity needed to reach the top
The champion apparently was not worried at all about D.T.'s strong points.Its chief builder, Taiwan-born Feng-hsiung Hsu, nicknamed his brainchild "the Weasel" for its tactical flair at wriggling out of horrible positions
In fact, D.T. never left home, Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, but communicated with its human handlers by telephone link.They conceded that the odds favored Mr. Kasparov, but they put their hope in D.T.'s recently enhanced capacity for examining positions -- up to a million per second, from 720,000
they needed kryptonite.This became apparent as game one, a Sicilian Defense by Mr. Kasparov, proceeded
This became apparent as game one, a Sicilian Defense by Mr. Kasparov, proceeded.No human can examine millions of moves, but Mr. Kasparov, using his ineffably powerful brain, consistently found very good ones
But the computer didn't play Mr. Short's ninth move, a key pawn thrust, and its position deteriorated rapidly.Instead of castling, a standard measure to safeguard the king, D.T. made a second-rate rook maneuver at move 13
Instead of castling, a standard measure to safeguard the king, D.T. made a second-rate rook maneuver at move 13; then it put a knight offside on move 16. "Only two classes of minds would think of this -- very weak human players, and computers

By move 21, D.T. had fallen into a deep positional trap.It allowed Mr. Kasparov to exchange his dark-squared bishop for one of D.T.'s knights.Bishops usually are worth slightly more than knights, but in this case Mr. Kasparov was left with a very dangerous knight and D.T.'s surviving bishop was reduced to passivity
Consistently, D.T. was over-optimistic about its chances.When most spectators thought its position hopeless, the computer thought it was only, in effect, one-half of a pawn down
When most spectators thought its position hopeless, the computer thought it was only, in effect, one-half of a pawn down.Such evaluations met with derision, and kept the machine from resigning as soon as humans would have -- prompting more derision
He also launched a kingside storm, sacrificing a pawn to denude D.T.'s king.No amount of weasling could have saved this game for D.T
No amount of weasling could have saved this game for D.T.A piece down, the computer resigned
Now, with the crowd in the analysis room smelling figurative blood, the only question seemed to be how fast Mr. Kasparov could win game two.With the advantage of playing white (which moves first), Mr. Kasparov followed up cleverly against the computer's defense, a Queen's Gambit Accepted
As early as move six, Mr. Kasparov deviated from a well-known sequence of moves, developing a knight instead of making a standard bishop attack against the computer's advanced knight.This left the computer with a broader range of plausible replies -- and it immediately blundered by moving a queenside pawn, to the neglect of kingside development
In a new position just after the opening, a computer will have serious problems.In such positions you have to create something new, and the computer isn't able to do that right now
After only 11 moves for each side, the computer's position was shaky.Greedily, it grabbed a pawn, at the cost of facing a brutal attack
And when a defensive move was called for, D.T. passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats.that "even a weak club player" would have avoided the queen move
Now, after only a dozen moves, spectators were looking for a mating combination.On a demonstration board, emcee Shelby Lyman showed a quick kill initiated by a knight sacrifice
Mr. Kasparov's continuation was slower but, in the end, just as deadly.He won D.T.'s queen for two minor pieces and two pawns -- not enough compensation, in this position, to give the computer much hope
And Mr. Kasparov, to cheers and applause, marched back into the analysis room. "In both games I got exactly what I wanted," he said
In both games I got exactly what I wanted," he said.What he had demonstrated is that there's more to chess than sheer calculation
It was a time when interest rates came down very rapidly.Yields on five-year CDs at major banks were averaging about 7.45%, and 10-year Treasury notes were paying less than 8%
Yields on five-year CDs at major banks were averaging about 7.45%, and 10-year Treasury notes were paying less than 8%.The CD seemed like a great deal
Instead, his Merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon CD, which is sold at a deep discount to its face value.The difference between the price and the face value payable at maturity is the investor's return
More important, the CD was purchased on the secondary, or resale, market.Because the CD had an effective yield of 13.4% when it was issued in 1984, and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then, part of the price Dr. Blumenfeld paid was a premium
Now the thrift that issued the CD is insolvent, and Dr. Blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium isn't insured under federal deposit insurance.The tip-off came when he opened a recent Merrill Lynch statement and found that the CD's "estimated current market value" had plummeted by $9,000 in a month
Several phone calls and a visit to his broker's office later, the dentist found out that the $9,000 drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the CD, and that the amount wasn't insured. "This is one thing I was never aware of
This is one thing I was never aware of," he says.He assumed that principal and interest were "fully insured up to $100,000
Dr. Blumenfeld isn't unique.Especially at times like these, when declining rates make it hard for investors to get yields they have come to expect, too many people chase the promise of above-market returns without fully appreciating the risk
Yield greed often gets in the way of understanding things.The biggest problem we have is that investors realize, after the fact, that they didn't understand what they were investing in
he didn't fully understand what he was buying.He says that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon CD and that he had previously invested in TIGRs (Treasury Income Growth Receipts), a type of zero-coupon Treasury security sold by Merrill Lynch
The broker, Thomas Beairsto of Merrill Lynch's Morristown, N.J., office, refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter, referring inquiries to Merrill Lynch officials in New York.Those officials say there was full disclosure of the risks in a "fact sheet" sent to all CD investors with their confirmation of sale
If the price paid for a CD purchased in the secondary market . . . is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero-coupon CDs, the difference . . . is not insured . . . . Computations involving zero-coupon CDs are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant
part of what he paid was a premium. "I assumed I was buying a CD as a CD
Nevertheless, Merrill Lynch has agreed that if the thrift that issued Dr. Blumenfeld's CD, Peoples Heritage Federal Savings & Loan Association in Salina, Kan., is liquidated and the CD terminated, the brokerage firm would cover the premium Dr. Blumenfeld paid. (Federal deposit insurance would pay principal and interest accrued to the date of liquidation, to a maximum of $100,000
It's not a blanket commitment, it's a case-by-case situation.There's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware" of the risks
There's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware" of the risks. "We weren't sure that full disclosure, as we wanted it, was being made
Merrill Lynch says it's impossible to estimate how many investors are in Dr. Blumenfeld's situation, although it says the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years.Merrill Lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose CDs it sells, which it didn't provide in 1986
Zero-coupon CDs are only a small portion of the $1 trillion-plus in CDs outstanding, and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total.that fewer than 10 financial institutions currently issue zero-coupon CDs
Because of the tax consequences of zero-coupon investments -- income tax is payable in the year interest is accrued, although interest isn't actually paid until maturity -- zero-coupon CDs are usually sold for tax-advantaged accounts to finance things like retirement and children's education.Most zero-coupon CDs are in maturities of six to nine years, and they usually double in value by maturity

Bourbon makes up just 1% of world-wide spirits consumption, but it represented 57% of U.S. liquor exports last year, according to Jobson; no other category had more than 19%.Big U.S. distillers are fiercely vying for this market, which grew to $77 million last year from $33 million in 1987, according to government figures

The Miami-based company's stock fell $1.75 yesterday to $20.75 a share in heavy American Stock Exchange composite trading.that Waertsilae Marine Industries, the Finnish shipyard that is building its three new cruise ships, planned to file for bankruptcy
Early yesterday, Carnival said in a company statement that it had been "notified unofficially" that Waertsilae Marine Industries, the Finnish shipyard that is building its three new cruise ships, planned to file for bankruptcy.Officials at Carnival declined to comment
There is just a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what the effect, if any, of all this is.I didn't even know that a company in a socialistic country could file for bankruptcy
Carnival said the "Fantasy," the first of the three $200 million ships that Carnival has on order, is scheduled to be delivered next month, just in time for the winter tourist season in the Caribbean.That ship, which would carry about 2,050 passengers, would expand the capacity of Carnival's existing 14-ship fleet by 24%
That ship, which would carry about 2,050 passengers, would expand the capacity of Carnival's existing 14-ship fleet by 24%.The second ship, which is half-completed, is scheduled to be delivered in fall 1990, and the third in fall 1991

those estimates are based on Fantasy being in operation in 1990.If the ship fails to arrive, those per-share earnings estimates could be trimmed 15 cents or more
Analysts weren't willing to speculate on how much money Carnival might lose through deposits.Normally, a company pays a portion of the total cost of a ship as it reaches various stages of construction
Carnival, for example, has already paid about $160 million of the total cost for Fantasy.this may give it the right to seize the ship if the situation warrants it

Sales of medium and heavy-duty trucks continue to lag previous-year rates, leading Eaton to expect fourth-quarter net income to fall below year-earlier levels, said Stephen R. Hardis, vice chairman and chief financial and administrative officer.He declined to make a specific earnings estimate
Third-quarter net was $40 million, or $1.04 a share, from $54.4 million, or $1.47 a share, a year ago.Sales rose 2.8% to $864.1 million, from $840.4 million
The quarter net was below analyst expectations mainly because truck-parts sales didn't rebound in September from the summer doldrums as they usually do.he is reducing his estimate for the year to the area of $5.70 a share, from his previous estimate of $6.10

Operating profit from electrical and electronics controls, Eaton's other major business group, fell 11% to $32 million, despite a 7.7% increase in sales to $376 million.The company attributed the decline to weakness in the commercial-switch market in North America and in the European appliance-controls market
For the nine months, net -- including profit from discontinued operations both years and in 1988 an extraordinary charge of $17.7 million related to settlement of a lawsuit -- was $170.6 million, or $4.54 a share, up 5.8% from $161.3 million, or $4.32 a share, a year ago.Eaton earned from continuing operations $165.1 million, or $4.40 a share, down 7% from $177.5 million, or $4.76 a share, a year earlier
Initial steps were taken at Poland's first international environmental conference, which I attended last month.The conference, held in Lower Silesia, was co-sponsored by the Environment Ministry, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, and the Polish Ecological Club, and was attended by 50 Poles from government and industry, as well as Hungarians, Czechs, Russians, Japanese and Americans
The conference was entitled "Economic Mechanisms for Environmental Protection," a significant departure from East Bloc usage, which recognizes only one economic mechanism -- central planning -- to direct industrial behavior.Even more remarkably, it focused on emissions trading and similar market approaches to address pollution, notwithstanding Poland's lack of functioning markets
Why did East Bloc participants unanimously endorse market-based pollution approaches?The answer lies both in the degraded environment of these countries and the perceived causes of that degradation
According to a detailed report by Zbigniew Bochniarz of the University of Minnesota's Hubert Humphrey Institute, 27 areas containing a third of Poland's population are regarded as "ecological hazards" due to multiple violations of standards.Norms are consistently exceeded at 60% of nitrogen oxide monitoring sites and 80% of those for dust and soot emissions
27 areas containing a third of Poland's population are regarded as "ecological hazards" due to multiple violations of standards.Norms are consistently exceeded at 60% of nitrogen oxide monitoring sites and 80% of those for dust and soot emissions.Four-fifths of Poland's soils have become highly acidified
27 areas containing a third of Poland's population are regarded as "ecological hazards" due to multiple violations of standards.Norms are consistently exceeded at 60% of nitrogen oxide monitoring sites and 80% of those for dust and soot emissions.Four-fifths of Poland's soils have become highly acidified; 70% of its southern forests are projected to die by century's end.Between 1965 and 1985, Polish waters fit for human consumption dropped from 33% to 6% of all surface waters, while those unfit even for industry use nearly doubled
Poland produces about 20 times more soot and five times more sulfur dioxide and solid waste per unit of gross national product than does Western Europe.Its mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50% higher than West Germany's, and 50% higher in hazard areas than the national average
Poland produces about 20 times more soot and five times more sulfur dioxide and solid waste per unit of gross national product than does Western Europe.Its mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50% higher than West Germany's, and 50% higher in hazard areas than the national average.Since 1978, average annual growth rates for most pollutants have outstripped the growth of GNP
Conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from (a) Marxist devaluation of environmental resources, which are not produced by labor; (b) planned economies' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government; and (c) the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development, producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West.They repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership, genuine competition based on market factors, and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions
Indeed, skepticism was amply captured by a joke told by Poles at the conference: "The world must be coming to an end.The Russians are talking peace.The Palestinians are talking elections
The Russians are talking peace.The Palestinians are talking elections
But the implications of such a shift to market approaches go well beyond the fact that Poland is already working on nationwide emissions trades to reduce smelter pollution, or that the Soviets plan to introduce marketable pollution permits in some republics next year.Those implications include: -- Privatization
Faced with a $40 billion foreign debt and skyrocketing inflation, Poland must privatize industry and eliminate subsidies to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance.Market-based pollution control may consume some capital that would otherwise purchase state industries
As conferees noted, scarce capital means the costs of control must be minimized through a broad menu of compliance choices for individual firms.That means simple, clear rules that secure the first large blocks of reduction, deferring more complex issues such as risk
It also means use of quantity-based pollution limits such as transferable permits, rather than price-based limits such as effluent fees.That's because quota-trained managers will likely respond better to quantity than to price signals
Even least-cost environmental solutions will require billions of dollars.New types of financing must make funds available without draining Poland's hard-currency reserves
East Bloc pollution data typically have been state secrets.While Polish data have been freely available since 1980, it was no accident that participants urged the free flow of information
that America has had a free market in goods but a planned economy for environmental protection, while Poland represents the opposite.His point: It will be increasingly difficult for the U.S. to cling to command-and-control measures if even the East Bloc steps to a different drummer

Why can't we teach our children to read, write and reckon?It's not that we don't know how to, because we do
It's not that we don't know how to, because we do.It's that we don't want to
And the reason we don't want to is that effective education would require us to relinquish some cherished metaphysical beliefs about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular, as well as to violate some cherished vested interests.These beliefs so dominate our educational establishment, our media, our politicians, and even our parents that it seems almost blasphemous to challenge them
Here is an example.If I were to ask a sample of American parents, "Do you wish the elementary schools to encourage creativity in your children?" the near-unanimous answer would be, "Yes, of course
But what do we mean, specifically, by "creativity"?No one can say
No one can say.In practice, it ends up being equated with a "self-expression" that encourages the youngsters' "self-esteem
In practice, it ends up being equated with a "self-expression" that encourages the youngsters' "self-esteem." The result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence is matched only by their good opinion of themselves
The whole notion of "creativity" in education was (and is) part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction, which was (and is) regarded as "authoritarian," a repression and frustration of the latent talents and the wonderful, if as yet undefined, potentialities inherent in the souls of all our children.It is not surprising that parents find this romantic extravagance so attractive
Fortunately, these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood, and they have enough common sense to know what that demands.Their commitment to "creativity" cannot survive adolescent illiteracy
Their commitment to "creativity" cannot survive adolescent illiteracy.American education's future will be determined by the degree to which we -- all of us -- allow this common sense to prevail over the illusions that we also share
The education establishment will fight against common sense every inch of the way.The reasons are complex, but one simple reason ought not to be underestimated
The reasons are complex, but one simple reason ought not to be underestimated. "Progressive education" (as it was once called) is far more interesting and agreeable to teachers than is disciplined instruction
It also provides teachers with a superior self-definition as a "profession," since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy.I myself took such courses in college, thinking I might end up a schoolteacher
I myself took such courses in college, thinking I might end up a schoolteacher.They could all fairly be described as "pap" courses
But it is unfair to dump on teachers, as distinct from the educational establishment.and, on the whole, they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching
and, on the whole, they are seriously committed to conscientious teaching.They may not be among the "best and brightest" of their generation -- there are very few such people, by definition
But they need not be to do their jobs well.Yes, we all can remember one or two truly inspiring teachers from our school days
But our education proceeded at the hands of those others, who were merely competent and conscientious.In this sense, a teacher can be compared to one's family doctor
In this sense, a teacher can be compared to one's family doctor.If he were brilliant, he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place
If he were brilliant, he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place.If he is competent and conscientious, he serves us well
Our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis.Whether they are or are not underpaid is a problem of equity; it is not an educational problem
Whether they are or are not underpaid is a problem of equity; it is not an educational problem.they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more
they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more.It is the kind of libel the teachers' unions don't mind spreading, for their own narrow purposes
But there is not one shred of evidence that, other things being equal, salary differentials result in educational differentials.If there were such evidence, you can be sure you would have heard of it
If we wish to be serious about American education, we know exactly what to do -- and, just as important, what not to do.There are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation, some of them in the poorest of ghettos, and they are all sending us the same message
Conversely, there are the majority of unsuccessful schools, and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed beforehand.We really do know all we need to know, if only we could assimilate this knowledge into our thinking
In this respect, it would be helpful if our political leaders were mute, rather than eloquently "concerned." They are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional pap
Thus at the recent governors' conference on education, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas announced that "this country needs a comprehensive child-development policy for children under five." A comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need
A comprehensive development policy for governors over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need.What Gov. Clinton is advocating, in effect, is extending the educational system down to the pre-kindergarten years

Whether desirable or not, this is a child-care program, not an educational program.We know that very early exposure to schooling improves performance in the first grade, but afterward the difference is quickly washed away
Parental involvement" is a bad idea.Parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children
Parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children.Parents should be involved with their children's education at home, not in school

In most states, increasing expenditures on education, in our current circumstances, will probably make things worse, not better.The reason is simple: Education takes place in the classroom, where the influence of money is minimal
Decades of educational research tell us unequivocally that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the pupils.The new money flows into the already top-heavy administrative structure, which busies itself piling more and more paper work on the teachers

Most important of all, schools should have principals with a large measure of authority over the faculty, the curriculum, and all matters of student discipline.Study after study -- the most recent from the Brookings Institution -- tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside interference and are governed by a powerful head

As thrifts sell assets to improve their capital-to-asset ratio, as required under the new law passed in August, they must also reduce liabilities, such as deposits.As interest rates paid depositors were lowered, thrift withdrawals exceeded deposits by $5.1 billion, not including interest credited to accounts
The downsizing of the thrift industry is well under way.This suggests the bailout law is having a more dramatic effect than anyone would have imagined so soon
some of the outflow to seasonal factors. "August is a month when people are paying school tuition
August is a month when people are paying school tuition.That and adjustment to the new law were the biggest factors in the industry
Thrifts raised capital mostly by selling mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, which were reduced by $7.8 billion in August from the prior month.As of Aug. 31, thrifts held $185 billion in mortgage-backed securities
The deposit numbers for August marked a swing back to huge outflows after a July net deposit inflow of $54 million -- the only net inflow in more than a year.Deposits aren't expected to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future, as the industry continues to shrink
For the first eight months of 1989, thrifts' withdrawals exceeded deposits by $44.5 billion.For the prior year, deposits exceeded withdrawals by $8.8 billion
The estimates of real gross national product prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the Department of Commerce significantly understate the rate of economic growth.Since the bureau's estimates for the business sector provide the numerator for the productivity ratios calculated by the Department of Labor, underestimated growth rates artificially depress official productivity statistics
In the early 1980s, I predicted a significant acceleration in productivity growth over the rest of the decade.This forecast was based on the apparent reversal of most of the negative forces -- such as demographic changes, the oil shock and accelerating inflation -- that had reduced productivity gains in the 1970s
evidence suggesting defects in the official output estimates.The evidence does not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth has become greater during the 1948-89 period, but all I am claiming is that the growth trend is understated
This bias is in no way deliberate.The understatement of growth is due largely to the conservative expedients adopted to deal with deficiencies in basic economic data
The first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates (mainly employment or hours) instead of output estimates for those sectors, such as governments, paid household services and private non-profit institutions, where there are difficulties in assembling output data.This means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor
This means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor.In an unrelated program in which the Labor Department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees, it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7% during the 1980s
In an unrelated program in which the Labor Department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees, it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of 1.7% during the 1980s.Even if it is assumed that productivity rose no more than half as quickly in the rest of the nonbusiness sector, this Labor Department estimate indicates a downward bias in the real GNP estimates of 0.2 percentage point a year, on average
The federal productivity estimators use labor input, rather than output, data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well.Independent estimates of output in those industries, including one by the Department of Labor for banking, suggests that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of at least 1.5% a year between 1948 and 1988
that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of at least 1.5% a year between 1948 and 1988.Because finance and services contribute 10% to final business product, missing these productivity improvements depresses the overall growth rate by 0.15% a year
The second source of error in growth statistics is the use of inappropriate deflators to adjust for price changes.that these mismeasurements as detailed by Martin N. Baily and Robert J. Gordon add a further 0.12 percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product
Finally, the official estimates understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services.In 1985, a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance characteristics was introduced, and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed
In sum, the biases ennumerated above indicate a 0.7 percentage point understatement in growth of total real GNP.For the private domestic business economy, the bias was a bit over 0.5 percentage point

Up to now, Drexel has made a rapid-fire series of settlements with 25 states and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico.Just yesterday, New Hampshire announced it made a $75,000 settlement with Drexel, a record-tying fine for a securities-law matter in that state
Just yesterday, New Hampshire announced it made a $75,000 settlement with Drexel, a record-tying fine for a securities-law matter in that state.These states have been entering into settlements with Drexel as part of the firm's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the U.S. despite its record as an admitted felon
the firm is meeting resistance from some big states, including New Jersey, New York, California, Pennsylvania, Connecticut and Missouri.they don't want to simply accept the settlements offered by Drexel
Officials in some of these states say they don't want to simply accept the settlements offered by Drexel.They question if Drexel is getting easier treatment than the many small penny-stock firms whose brokerage licenses are routinely revoked
Drexel has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that includes payment of $650 million in penalties.These stem from a two-year federal investigation of insider trading and securities fraud on Wall Street
it doesn't expect any of its state brokerage licenses will be revoked, and even if some are, its securities business wouldn't be directly hurt.It already has sold its retail, or individual-investor, brokerage network
There was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue.The question is whether Drexel should be allowed to pay and move on, or "whether you should (simply) revoke the license when someone is convicted of a felony
I don't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions.I can see both sides
I don't think, as we say in investment banking, that `by the end of the day' we'll be losing any licenses.There are states that have asked for additional information, which we are providing to them
more than $2.8 million has been paid to 26 states and that Drexel still expects to pay out a total of $11.5 million.By the end of this week, Drexel should have another three to four settlements
That total would be important for Drexel.The investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry.A proviso to that promise is that a minimum of 35 states reach settlement agreements before next Tuesday
The investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry.A proviso to that promise is that a minimum of 35 states reach settlement agreements before next Tuesday
New Jersey, for example, was asked to accept $300,000, but refused.The state isn't ruling out revoking Drexel's brokerage license
The state can also bar Drexel as an investment adviser.State officials won't describe their position in detail, but James McLelland Smith, state securities chief, said: "We really are still looking at it and have informed (Drexel) that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement
Connecticut already has issued a "notice of intent" to revoke Drexel's brokerage license.It is one of the states that have met with Mr. Cohen and asked for additional information about investors' accounts and other matters
It is one of the states that have met with Mr. Cohen and asked for additional information about investors' accounts and other matters. "This particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital-formation market," state Banking Commissioner Howard Brown said
This particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital-formation market.Commissioner Brown doesn't feel that money alone is the issue here
Particularly touchy are the cases of New York, which is Drexel's base, and California, the base of Drexel's highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm's legal difficulties.Neither state has settled, and officials in the two states won't discuss their reasons for not doing so
This process should point out that it's not going to be easy for a firm that's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business.We need to have somebody worried so they don't do this again
Time Warner is in the process of completing its acquisition of the remaining Warner shares.Time Warner emphasized in a news release that it should be evaluated based on its cash flow, which the company defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
Time Warner emphasized in a news release that it should be evaluated based on its cash flow, which the company defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.On a pro-forma basis, assuming the merger was effective Jan 1, 1988, including the results from both Time Inc. and all of Warner, that cash flow figure would be $526 million for the latest quarter, more than double the comparable figure a year ago, or $242 million, according to Time Warner
Some analysts at least are buying that argument, and weren't alarmed by the losses. "What really matters is the operating income of the divisions
For example, Warner made more than $100 million from filmed entertainment in three months.That's a big number
In the year-ago third quarter, Time on its own reported net income of $81 million, or $1.42 a share.Combined revenue for the latest quarter of Time Warner was $2.2 billion, compared with the year-ago Time revenue of $1.1 billion
On a pro forma basis, including all of Warner's earnings, Time Warner had a third-quarter loss of $217 million, compared with a $342 million loss a year earlier.On the same basis, revenue rose to $2.7 billion from $2.2 billion
For the third quarter, Warner's $106 million loss compared with a year-ago loss of $113 million, or 90 cents a share.Revenue rose to $1.5 billion from $1.1 billion
Revenue rose to $1.5 billion from $1.1 billion.The 1988 figures were restated to include the results of Lorimar Telepictures Corp., which Warner acquired in January
Time Warner's operating earnings got a boost from Warner's record box-office results. "Batman" alone has racked up more than $247 million in box-office receipts to date, making it Warner Bros. ' largest grossing film ever
Batman" alone has racked up more than $247 million in box-office receipts to date, making it Warner Bros. ' largest grossing film ever. "Lethal Weapon II" was also a big hit
its operating cash flow declined in the quarter for its magazine division, its books division and the Home Box Office programming division.In magazines, higher advertising revenues at Sports Illustrated and Fortune were offset by lower ad revenue for other major magazines.The programming division saw a decline in operating cash flow because the year-ago quarter included a $12 million dividend from Turner Broadcasting System and because the quarter includes expenses associated with the Nov. 15 launch of HBO's Comedy Channel

Beyond that, many big oil, chemical and airline companies are siphoning off big chunks of the market by insuring themselves through "captive" offshore companies for industry-specific coverage.Even Lloyd's specialty -- unusually risky ventures -- is being challenged

He said that he was particularly interested in his firm gaining expertise in futures, options, mortgaged-backed securities, computerized trading and investment systems as well as mergers and acquisitions.Mr. Dozen said Daiwa's strengths were its large capital base, its influential position in the Tokyo market and its links to Japanese corporations and institutional investors
Mr. Dozen joined Daiwa upon his graduation from Kyoto University in 1959.Like many young recruits in Japanese securities firms, he began his career peddling stock to individual investors
In his climb to the top, Mr. Dozen also headed the company's stock-exchange division, its fixed-income units and its international operations. "He was constantly picking up new things to fill out his experience
He was constantly picking up new things to fill out his experience; he is very well-balanced
But it Mr. Dozen's experience as a salesman that enabled him to gain the political support -- particularly from the retail sales force -- to accede to the presidency.Commission income from domestic stock and bond sales accounts form a large portion of Japanese securities companies' earnings
If Mr. Dozen has a weakness, it may be his golf game. "He digs in the sand instead of hitting the ball, like a farmer
Inco shares fell after the announcements.some investors were disappointed that the cash-rich company had failed to announce a special dividend
some investors were disappointed that the cash-rich company had failed to announce a special dividend.Inco closed at $31.125 a share, down 62.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
Inco's net fell to $129.3 million, or $1.23 a share, in the third quarter from $200.3 million, or $1.88 a share, a year earlier.Sales rose 8.2% to $848.7 million from $784.5 million

The effort to create the nation's largest employee-owned company began unraveling Oct. 13 when the labor-management group was unable to obtain financing for its $300-a-share, $6.79 billion offer.Just last week it suffered another major setback when British Airways PLC, the largest equity investor in the labor-management bid, withdrew its support
But the board said it wasn't interested for now.That proposal, valued at between $225 and $240 a share, would have transferred majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands
But it was clear that for the time being, the board wants the company to return to normalcy.it concluded that "the welfare of the company, its shareholders, its employees and the broader public . . . can best be enhanced by continued development of UAL as a strong, viable, independent company
But Mr. Wolf faces a monumental task in pulling the company back together again.Labor problems top the list
Labor problems top the list.For a brief time, the buy-out effort seemed to solve his problems with United's pilot union
For a brief time, the buy-out effort seemed to solve his problems with United's pilot union.In return for an ownership stake in the company, the pilots were willing to agree to a seven-year contract that included a no-strike clause and significant wage concessions and productivity gains the union previously resisted
That contract was tied to the success of the buy-out.As a "good-will measure," the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly UAL's two new Boeing 747-400 aircraft
As a "good-will measure," the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly UAL's two new Boeing 747-400 aircraft.It's uncertain if the pilots will continue to do so without a contract settlement
The buy-out effort also worsened already-strained relations between United's pilot and machinist unions.The machinists' criticisms of the labor-management bid and their threats of a strike unless they received substantial wage increases this year helped cool banks' interest in financing the transaction
The machinists previously had shown themselves to be an ally to Mr. Wolf, but he lost much of his credibility with that group when he teamed up with the pilot union.The machinists criticized the terms Mr. Wolf and management received in the buy-out
The machinists criticized the terms Mr. Wolf and management received in the buy-out.They paid $15 million for a 1% stake and received an additional 9% of the company at no additional cost
His credibility is also on the line in the investment community.Until the collapse of this bid, Mr. Wolf was regarded as one of the nation's savviest airline executives after engineering turnarounds of Tiger International Inc. and Republic Airlines
they were disappointed the company didn't announce some recapitalization or other plan to maximize value.that arbitragers could force a recapitalization through the written consent process under which holders may oust the board by a majority vote

its attempt to crack the $10 billion market for dynamic random access memory chips, a market dominated by the Japanese.Those chips were in dire shortage last year
its experience during the shortage didn't merit the $5 million to $50 million investment U.S. Memories is seeking from each investor. "At this time, we elected not to get involved
but doesn't presage U.S. Memories' failure. "I would like to have had them
two or three major corporations to announce their participation in U.S. Memories soon after the group finishes a business plan, probably late this week.U.S. Memories needs a catalyst to inspire others to join
But so far, most potential participants haven't decided.Sun Microsystems Inc. said it's still actively evaluating U.S. Memories and plans to meet with U.S. Memories representatives later this week

In a startling turnabout, Members of the Senate Intelligence Committee are complaining that someone in the executive branch is leaking on them.David Boren, the Intelligence Committee chairman, is upset that someone leaked a letter to the committee from the Reagan administration suggesting that the U.S. would undertake to warn Panamanian thug Manuel Noriega if it got wind of an impending coup that might result in his assassination
With due respect to "highly classified correspondence" and other buzzwords, the leakers are performing a public service.If the CIA has become a protection service for Mr. Noriega, the American people ought to know
If the CIA has become a protection service for Mr. Noriega, the American people ought to know.What went wrong in Panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry
What went wrong in Panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry.Naturally, Senator Boren and his committee would like free rein to blame the executive branch while stamping "top secret" on their own complicity
The President of the United States urged the Panamanian armed forces to move against Mr. Noriega.When they did, his commanders didn't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads
When they did, his commanders didn't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads.The executive branch bears the first responsibility for timidity
For example, what exactly did the CIA tell Major Giroldi and his fellow coup plotters about U.S. laws and executive orders on assassinations?What part did U.S. warnings play in the major's unwillingness to pull the trigger when he had General Noriega in custody, but was under attack by pro-Noriega troops

Mr. Noriega didn't suffer from any hesitation once he had the pistol.Maybe we need a CIA version of the Miranda warning: You have the right to conceal your coup intentions, because we may rat on you
CIA chief William Webster, hardly a Washington malcontent, got the debate started last week by noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to U.S. paralysis during the coup.The CIA's Deputy Director of Operations, Richard Stoltz, tried to smooth things over a few days later, but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster's point
but instead simply underlined Mr. Webster's point. "The interpretation" of the executive order and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it, has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators, including me
In other words, Congress won't let the CIA do much of anything anymore, and that's fine with the CIA.The pay's the same, and the duty's lighter
And of course, doing anything that might be second-guessed by Congress carries heavy penalties.Witness the Walsh prosecution of Ollie North

What kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who've read all this and know what can happen if they fail?Who wants to end up as the protagonist in a Bill Cohen morality play
The order against assassinations is another artifact of the same congressional mind-set, a product of the 1970s Vietnam syndrome against any executive action.President Bush would do himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend America's national security
President Bush would do himself and the country a favor by rescinding the order as an ambiguous intrusion on his ability to defend America's national security.There are of course good reasons the U.S. shouldn't get into the assassination business, but rescinding the executive order is not the same thing as saying the U.S. should start passing out exploding cigars

The world being the nasty place it is, we want Presidents to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed.In such situations, you cannot write rules in advance, you can only make sure the President takes the responsibility
The executive order and the reported agreements with the Intelligence Committee are neither sensible nor moral.As it now stands, the U.S. can bomb Tripoli, but can't "assassinate" Colonel Gadhafi
As it now stands, the U.S. can bomb Tripoli, but can't "assassinate" Colonel Gadhafi.It can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the Bekaa Valley, but can't shoot Abu Nidal
It can send a fighter squadron to strafe terrorist hideouts in the Bekaa Valley, but can't shoot Abu Nidal.Both the assassination order and the quality of debate in Washington are telling the world that the only way the U.S. will kill a madman is by making sure we take some innocent civilians with him

ending a long association between the two companies that has turned increasingly bitter recently.Goodson has accused Ingersoll of paying less attention to its properties and more to such ventures as the recent launch of the St. Louis Sun

But Mr. Roman flatly denied the speculation, saying Mr. Sorrell had tried several times to persuade him to stay, offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine (The wine, naturally, was Seagram's brand, an Ogilvy client). "He asked me not to resign

Last month, Paribas's archrival, Cie.Financiere de Suez, won a battle for Groupe Victoire, France's second-largest private-sector insurer.That complex bid was billed as France's largest takeover ever (this one is slightly smaller)
Paribas officials, once considered France's toughest bankers, felt abashed at Suez's success and its rapid growth.the new bid in part simply reflects the continuing rivalry between France's two largest investment banking groups
It also reflects the broader pressure on companies in Europe to keep up as the European Community prepares to reduce internal trade barriers by 1992.the potential for the two groups instead to cooperate
the acquisition would give Paribas fresh diversity, bringing it properties in food and transport where it has been weak.Navigation Mixte has investments in a sugar company, a food and canning concern, a bakery and bus and trucking firms, among others
And Navigation Mixte has a huge hidden attraction.Payment by Allianz for the insurance interests it has just bought will help swell the French concern's treasury to an estimated 11 billion francs
Alternatively, it said it would offer three Paribas shares, themselves eligible for dividends as of next Jan. 1, for one Navigation Mixte share.Paribas shares closed down 30 francs at 610 francs, and Navigation Mixte shares were suspended at 1,800 francs pending the outcome of the bid

Speculators got too long too soon and ran into resistance around the old contract highs.that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric tons and only a modest increase in consumption, sugar isn't likely to rise above the top of its trading range without a crop problem in a major producing country

but courage of a rare sort made her remarkable life possible.I've ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life, or whose life was more complicated than Josephine's
Men were a constant complication.Baker had lots of them
But she didn't trust them and didn't reward trust.As she saw one key love affair, the problem wasn't her infidelity, it was his jealousy
Her appetite for children also was large.She adopted 12 of assorted races
She made money, but spent more.Friends pitched in
Another lifelong complication was racism.Baker had the good luck to arrive in 1925 Paris, where blacks had become exotic

To be exotic was to be patronized as well as prized, but for the most part Paris was a friendly island in a racist world.Baker had bitter experience of bigotry from her St. Louis childhood and her days in New York theater, where she was judged too dark for an all-black chorus line (performing of course for all-white audiences)

Jazz Cleopatra" contains other, more important, false notes that undermine what is, for the most part, a lively account of a life already familiar from earlier works.It is easy to see why Baker, a free spirit who broke many of the restraints convention places on women, attracts Ms. Rose, the author of "Parallel Lives," a wonderful study of Victorian marriage
Still, even the title raises questions about the author's vision of her subject.Baker's art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term

One devoted fan who fell under Baker's spell in 1963 and began collecting Baker memorabilia was Bryan Hammond.In "Josephine Baker" (Jonathan Cape, 304 pages, $35), which was published in Britain last year and distributed in the U.S. this month, Mr. Hammond has used his collection to produce an album of photographs and drawings of the star

Manville, having rid itself of asbestos, now sells fiberglass, forest products, minerals and industrial goods.Heady stuff it's not
But Manville's ownership is unusual.The Denver-based concern is controlled by the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust
The Denver-based concern, which emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings late last year, is controlled by the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust.The trust, which owns 80% of Manville's stock on a fully diluted basis, is a separate legal entity that is settling claims with asbestos victims
Their principal asset is Manville common stock.If they tried to sell, they'd be chasing their own tail
If they tried to sell, they'd be chasing their own tail.What makes the most sense is to find someone who wants to buy the whole company or cause a recapitalization of all shares
However, the trust's cash flow from investments is far short of its payments to asbestos victims.Its cash and liquid securities fell by $338 million in the first six months of 1989
And, beginning in 1992, it will have a claim on as much as 20% of Manville's annual net income.Even so, the trust would seem to be facing a cash crunch
Even so, the trust would seem to be facing a cash crunch.As of June 30, it had settled only about 15,000 of the 81,000 received claims from asbestos victims, for an average of $40,424 each
As of June 30, it had settled only about 15,000 of the 81,000 received claims from asbestos victims, for an average of $40,424 each. (The average should drop over time, since the most expensive claims are being settled first
And as of midyear, settled but unpaid claims amounted to $136 million -- more than half the trust's total of $268 million in cash and marketable securities. "At some point, we're going to need an infusion of funds
Even before then, the trust may be eager to unload Manville stock.It doesn't pay a dividend, and this trust needs income
Moreover, with 88% of its assets tied up in Manville, the trust is badly in need of diversification. "Obviously, a diversified portfolio would have less risk
Manville itself doesn't rule out a restructuring.Though the ink is barely dry on its new, post-bankruptcy law structure, Bill Bullock, Manville's head of investor relations, says the company is continually pondering "whether there is a better way to be structured
whether there is a better way to be structured.that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares
Thus the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt Manville's other shareholders. "This is a rare case of a company with a big majority holder which will probably act in the interests of the minority holders
Even if there is no restructuring, Manville seems to be attractive long-term.Its stock, at 9 5/8, trades at about 8 1/2 times estimated 1989 earnings -- an appropriately low multiple for a company with recession-sensitive customers

They are, nonetheless, high on Manville's management. "It's one of the best in the business," says Salomon Brothers analyst Stephen Dobi
So far, as a price-conscious shopper, Manville hasn't bought much.Even though they have borrowing power, they have been disciplined about acquisitions

The plan places an indicated value on the real estate operation, Santa Fe Pacific Realty Corp., of $2 billion.Santa Fe Pacific directors are expected to review the plan at a meeting today, according to people familiar with the transaction
If approved, the sale is expected to close by year's end, with the spinoff occurring by the end of 1992.In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Santa Fe Pacific closed at $20.625, down 25 cents
Santa Fe Pacific Realty is a major California land and building owner whose prime properties include 1,850 undeveloped acres in the San Francisco Bay area, and several office sites.A spokesman said the properties survived without significant damage in last week's Northern California earthquake
Also holding two seats each on the board, they said, would be Olympia & York Developments Ltd., controlled by the Reichmann family of Canada, and Itel Corp., controlled by Chicago businessman Sam Zell.The Reichmanns and Mr. Zell, the largest holders of Santa Fe Pacific stock, have been looking for ways to raise the value of their investments, including possible spinoffs
Itel bought a 17% stake in Sante Fe Pacific last year and Olympia & York later purchased about a 20% stake; they would have interests in the new realty company in line with their holdings in Sante Fe Pacific
what could lead to the breakup of Santa Fe Pacific into free-standing companies for its railroad and energy operations, as well as real estate.The debt-laden parent has been under pressure from large shareholders to boost the company's share price
The California pension fund's planned investment in the real estate unit is unusual.Pension funds rarely own as much as a 20% stake in what is expected to be a publicly traded company
that would be convertible into additional shares of the realty company after the second year at the then-prevailing market price.The note would accrue interest at the rate of 13.5% a year, which would be payable to the fund after five years, according to Stephen E. Roulac, a real estate consultant working for the fund
The purpose of the note is to provide added capital for the spun-off company in a form that will save it spending cash on immediate interest payments, Mr. Roulac said.The spun-off concern "clearly will be one of the dominant real estate development companies with a prime portfolio," he said
hurting profits that the parent had generated in the past from periodic sales from its portfolio.Real estate operating income for the first nine months fell to $71.9 million from $143 million a year earlier
that Santa Fe Pacific Realty would repay more than $500 million in debt owed to the parent before the planned spinoff.That would help reduce Santa Fe Pacific's remaining debt to about $600 million from a high of $3.7 billion in early 1988
It wasn't clear where Santa Fe Pacific expected to obtain the payment of more than $500 million.The realty unit might take on new debt or obtain additional investors, among other possibilities
The realty unit might take on new debt or obtain additional investors, among other possibilities.The Santa Fe Pacific spokesman declined to comment on that aspect, saying the deal was still under negotiation
but under a previously announced strategy, the company has targeted building on 5,400 acres in California, Arizona and the Chicago area.Among those are the 1,850 acres in the San Francisco Bay area, including 208 acres in the Mission Bay area
The California pension fund, which has $16 billion already invested in real estate and mortgages, could be a valuable funding source for that development.The fund is the nation's largest public employee fund, and it has a growing cash flow now topping $3 billion a year
but they were approached with the idea by real estate brokers JMB Realty Corp. of Chicago.JMB officials are expected to be hired to represent the pension fund on the Santa Fe Pacific Realty board, Mr. Roulac said, to insulate the fund from potential liability problems
After two mistrials, the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of GAF Corp. and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, have changed considerably.The first two GAF trials were watched closely on Wall Street because they were considered to be important tests of the government's ability to convince a jury of allegations stemming from its insider-trading investigations
The government's credibility in the GAF case depended heavily on its star witness, Boyd L. Jefferies, the former Los Angeles brokerage chief who was implicated by former arbitrager Ivan Boesky, and then pointed the finger at Mr. Sherwin, takeover speculator Salim B. Lewis and corporate raider Paul Bilzerian.The GAF trials were viewed as previews of the government's strength in its cases against Mr. Lewis and Mr. Bilzerian

The dispute pits two groups of claimants against each other.Baltimore attorney Michael A.

Exxon has made them before, at which point the state demonstrated they were untrue.The state will vigorously defend against any counterclaim
The oil company claims that it had permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to the spill to use dispersant during such an incident at the discretion of the U.S. Coast Guard.The state's opposition to the use of dispersants caused the Coast Guard "to delay granting permission

But in private meetings yesterday, Budget Director Richard Darman argued that only $1.5 billion in new federal appropriations are needed to supplement existing resources.A White House budget office analysis estimates that $500 million -- or half the level in the committee bill -- is needed for highway assistance to meet California's needs, and the administration rejects the notion that new appropriations are needed to finance disaster loans by the Small Business Administration

no single influence was greater than Mr. Whitten.A master of pork-barrel politics, he had crafted the $2.85 billion package in vintage style and used the full force of his chairmanship to keep the proposal intact and dismiss any alternative
When Mr. Fazio offered the California-backed $3.84 billion plan, Mr. Whitten insisted that the full 14 pages be read aloud by the panel's clerk to underscore the range of legislative changes also sought by the delegation.On the chairman's motion, the California package was subsequently reduced to less-binding report language
More important than money in many cases are waivers California is seeking on current restrictions covering federal highway funds, such as a $100 million cap on how much any single state can receive in emergency funds in a year.Mr. Whitten's package appears to accomplish this purpose, but the state faces more resistance in its bid for an extended waiver on having to put up any matching funds on repairs completed in the next six months
A member in the House leadership and skilled legislator, Mr. Fazio nonetheless found himself burdened not only by California's needs but by Hurricane Hugo amendments he accepted in a vain effort to build support in the panel.The California Democrat appeared embarrassed by provisions inserted on behalf of owners of private beaches in the Virgin Islands, and lumber interests sought to add another $100 million in federal aid to plant timber on private land in North and South Carolina

Sen. Alan Cranston trekked over to the House side of Capitol Hill a few days ago and volunteered his testimony to fellow Democrat Rep. Henry Gonzalez.It was offered as an expression of cooperation to Mr. Gonzalez, who is investigating the $2.5 billion failure of Lincoln Savings & Loan Association
But instead of thanks, Sen. Cranston was treated with cool formality. "Every witness receives a formal subpoena," Rep. Gonzalez told him
the agency is investigating whether Lincoln made illegal political contributions.Mr. Keating arranged nearly $1 million in donations to Sen. Cranston and his various political causes, and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers
Mr. Keating arranged nearly $1 million in donations to Sen. Cranston and his various political causes, and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers.Future witnesses include a former federal S&L regulator who has accused the five senators of attempting to "subvert" the regulatory process by intervening on behalf of Mr. Keating
he considers intervening with regulators to be improper. "When you reach a point where a policy-making body is trying to shape administrative decisions, then that's a no-no in my book
And he has attached himself to the Lincoln story tenaciously. "Unless the questions are answered, I will keep on going
But Chairman Gonzalez is a genuine maverick.He comes from the same political line as Wright Patman, a bank-baiting Texas populist who chaired the Banking Committee until 1974
Mr. Gonzalez is also a stickler for ethical standards who refuses to accept honorariums and who believes in conducting official business in the open.Early in his political career, as a city councilman in San Antonio, he walked out of a meeting when political supporters asked that the police chief be replaced, denouncing the closed-door affair publicly as a "bat-roost meeting
The immediate target of Rep. Gonzalez's inquiry is Danny Wall, chairman of the Office of Thrift Supervision.As the principal regulator of the thrift industry, Mr. Wall delayed seizing Lincoln S&L for more than two years after his staff told him that the California thrift was insolvent and that potential losses to taxpayers were growing rapidly
Rep. Gonzalez seems primed to lash out at Mr. Wall when hearings resume Thursday with testimony by two federal regulators from San Francisco, William Black and Mike Patriarca.Mr. Wall relieved them of responsibility for supervising Lincoln in 1988
Mr. Wall relieved them of responsibility for supervising Lincoln in 1988.Mr. Gonzalez expressed concern over a report that the two had been summoned to Washington by Mr. Wall last week to discuss their testimony in advance
Mr. Gonzalez expressed concern over a report that the two had been summoned to Washington by Mr. Wall last week to discuss their testimony in advance. "I think he is trying to improperly influence a witness, and by God I'm not going to tolerate it," he says
Mr. Wall, however, is a self-proclaimed "child of the Senate" and former staff director of its Banking Committee.An inquiry into his handling of Lincoln S&L inevitably will drag in Sen. Cranston and the four others, Sens.Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), John McCain (R., Ariz.), John Glenn (D., Ohio) and Donald Riegle (D., Mich.)
An inquiry into his handling of Lincoln S&L inevitably will drag in Sen. Cranston and the four others, Sens.Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), John McCain (R., Ariz.), John Glenn (D., Ohio) and Donald Riegle (D., Mich.).They all attended a meeting in April 1987 questioning why a federal audit of Lincoln S&L had dragged on for two years
They all attended a meeting in April 1987 questioning why a federal audit of Lincoln S&L had dragged on for two years. "I'm certain that in the course of the hearings the names {of the senators} will be brought out
This is raising eyebrows. "When I first got a glimpse at the witness list, I couldn't believe that they were going to go ahead and do this," says Michael Waldman, director of Congress Watch, a consumer group
When I first got a glimpse at the witness list, I couldn't believe that they were going to go ahead and do this.There are some witnesses who will be forced to testify about their meetings with senators
they merely were trying to ensure fairness for a constituent.Mr. Keating lives in Phoenix, and the California thrift's parent is an Ohio-chartered corporation with holdings in Michigan
Chairman Gonzalez expresses sympathy for Sen. Riegle, his counterpart as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. "He's wise, he's good and I know he's an honest man," the Texan says
But at the same time, Mr. Gonzalez hasn't forgotten a confrontation over Mr. Wall during House-Senate negotiations over S&L bailout legislation during the summer.The Senate negotiators included Sens.Cranston and Riegle and Mr. Wall's principal sponsor, Republican Sen. Jake Garn of Utah
They were willing to trade important provisions in the bailout legislation to preserve Mr. Wall's job and to avoid a reconfirmation hearing in which he would be called upon to testify about Lincoln S&L.Most importantly, the Senate traded away the Bush administration's controversial plan to finance the bailout, which was partly reinstated later
At the time, Mr. Gonzalez said several senators told him that they "could get some roadblocks out of the way if there could be some understanding on Garn's insistence on Wall." Now Mr. Gonzalez is holding the equivalent of reconfirmation hearings anyway, under the guise of the Lincoln investigation
Now Mr. Gonzalez is holding the equivalent of reconfirmation hearings anyway, under the guise of the Lincoln investigation. "In a way, that's what this is
Even some House Banking Committee members could suffer from the fallout.Mr. Keating raised $20,000 for Rep. Doug Barnard's 1986 re-election campaign while the Georgia Democrat was taking his side against regulators who wanted to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit brokering
while the Georgia Democrat was taking his side against regulators who wanted to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit brokering.He recently voted "present" when the committee authorized a subpoena to compel Mr. Keating to testify
But the chairman's supporters have the upper hand as federal regulators press a $1.1 billion fraud suit against Mr. Keating and others.Rep. Jim Leach (R., Iowa) says the Lincoln S&L affair is "the biggest bank heist in history," and adds: "The great question that remains to be resolved is whether we have a congressional Watergate in the making
But the witness, William Crawford, California's chief state thrift regulator, denies saying that. "I don't know whether it was done properly or not, because I'm not a lawyer," he said in a telephone interview yesterday
The committee also has summoned Mr. Wall's predecessor, Edwin Gray.He has characterized the five senators' roles as "tantamount to an attempt to subvert the . . . regulatory process," and he isn't expected to back down even though the five senators have disputed his account of a 1987 meeting
So the senators must brace themselves.Sen. Cranston, as he returned to the capital last week from a one-day trip to inspect earthquake damage in San Francisco, sighed to an aide: "Well, back to Keatingland

Undeterred by such words of caution, corporate America is flocking to Moscow, lured by a huge untapped market and Mikhail Gorbachev's attempt to overhaul the Soviet economy.Doing business with the Russians, once the pursuit of a handful of hardened veterans, has become the goal of such major companies as General Motors Corp., Federal Express Corp. and Procter & Gamble Co., as well as a cluster of smaller firms

But while U.S. interest may be big and growing, the difficulties that have stymied deals in the past show no sign of abating.Alongside the old problems of a non-convertible currency and an inpenetrable bureaucracy, Western business executives must now grapple with new complexities linked to perestroika, the restructuring of the Soviet economy
Mr. Gorbachev's moves to break up the government's foreign trade monopoly have created uncertainties as well as opportunities.Changing legislation has opened the field to thousands of inexperienced Soviet players, many who promise more than they can deliver
You have to go out to all your constituents," says James H. Giffen, who is spearheading the most ambitious attempt by U.S. firms to break into the Soviet market, involving investment of more than $5 billion in some two dozen joint ventures.As part of that attempt, by the American Trade Consortium, Mr. Giffen says he spends a lot of time lobbying
Growing public fears about the Soviet environment is one new factor affecting some joint-venture plans.Over the past two years, Soviet ministries have been talking to international firms, including Occidental Petroleum Co. and Combustion Engineering Inc. of the U.S., Montedison S.p.A. of Italy and several Japanese groups, about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants.The plans have come under fire from Soviet environmentalists, and officials say many are likely to be scaled back or dropped

Whatever the difficulties, Mr. Gorbachev remains committed to increasing foreign trade.For political as well as economic reasons, U.S. companies are at the top of his priorities -- a point he underscored by spending two hours walking around the U.S. trade show last week
Talking to a small group of U.S. executives afterwards, Mr. Gorbachev appeared impatient for a big expansion in U.S.-Soviet trade, which now amounts to a meager $3 billion annually.The U.S. ranks fourth of countries that have concluded joint ventures, behind West Germany, Finland and Italy
Judging by the crush at the exhibition, deprived Soviet consumers are more than ready for U.S. products.Hundreds of people lined up every day at the Colgate-Palmolive Co. stand to receive a free tube of toothpaste, a commodity in chronically short supply here

Both Colgate and Procter & Gamble have received big orders for toothpaste, soap and detergents.it is planning to ship some $500 million of consumer goods, financed by bank credits, in the first few months of next year
But the current Soviet purchasing spree may be a one-time affair.The goal of most U.S. firms -- joint ventures -- remains elusive
The goal of most U.S. firms -- joint ventures -- remains elusive.Because the Soviet ruble isn't convertible into dollars, marks and other Western currencies, companies that hope to set up production facilities here must either export some of the goods to earn hard currency or find Soviet goods they can take in a counter-trade transaction
International competition for the few Soviet goods that can be sold on world markets is heating up, however.West German companies already have snapped up much of the production of these items
Seeking to overcome the currency problems, Mr. Giffen's American Trade Consortium, which comprises Chevron Corp., RJR, Johnson & Johnson, Eastman Kodak Co., and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., has concocted an elaborate scheme to share out dollar earnings, largely from the revenues of a planned Chevron oil project.Several medical concerns, including Pfizer Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., Colgate and Abbott Laboratories intend to pursue a similar consortium approach

The linkup with Credit Agricole will give Nuovo Banco its first foreign presence since it was formed from the wreck of the old Banco Ambrosiano, which collapsed amid scandal after the death of Chairman Roberto Calvi in 1982.Since then, the bank has strengthened its Italian network, and has posted strong results

the junk market was in disarray, according to people familiar with the discussion.He said Drexel -- the leading underwriter of high-risk junk bonds -- could no longer afford to sell any junk offerings if they might later become troubled because Drexel risked losing its highly lucrative junk franchise
Amid the market disorder, even Drexel, which has the widest and most loyal following of junk bond investors, is pulling in its horns.Although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market, Drexel has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults, withdrawn new offerings, redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of once-devoted investors
For many money managers, the past four months have been humiliating. "This is the worst shakeout ever in the junk market, and it could take years before it's over
In the third quarter, for example, junk bonds -- those with less than an investment-grade rating -- showed negative returns, the only major sector of the bond market to do so.Since the end of last year, junk bonds have been outperformed by all categories of investment-grade bonds, including ultra-safe Treasury securities
The junk market, which mushroomed to $200 billion from less than $2 billion at the start of the decade, has been declining for months as issuers have stumbled under the weight of hefty interest payments.The fragile market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp., which created its U.S. retailing empire with more than $3 billion in junk financing

that the market is troubled but still viable and, appropriately enough, quite quality-conscious.Nobody's been perfect in their credit judgments the past couple years
What has jolted many junk buyers is the sudden realization that junk bonds cannot necessarily be bought and sold with the ease of common stocks and many investment-grade bonds.Unlike the New York Stock Exchange, where buyers and sellers are quickly matched, the junk market, where risky corporate loans are traded, is sometimes closed for repairs
the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary malaise.In recent months there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market's traditional investors, while new buyers haven't materialized to replace them
Investors, trying to raise cash, have sold "large liquid issues" such as RJR Holdings Corp. and Kroger Co.; declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market's distress
Meanwhile, Prudential, the nation's largest insurer and the biggest investor in junk bonds, has seen the value of its junk bond portfolio drop to $6.5 billion from $7 billion since August because of falling junk prices. "We certainly do have a lack of liquidity here, and it's something to be concerned about

And the risks aren't appropriate for us," he says.The big insurer, unlike Prudential, owns only about $150 million of publicly sold junk bonds
The string of big junk bond defaults, which have been a major cause of the market's problems this year, probably will persist, some analysts say. "If anything, we're going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined," says Paul Asquith, associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management
this year's junk bond defaults already show a high correlation with his own findings.His study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of 34%
Obviously, we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people who told us the market wasn't so risky.that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds
that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds.The junk market is no bonanza as Drexel claimed, but it also isn't a disaster as the doomsayers say

When consumers have so many choices, brand loyalty is much harder to maintain.that 53% of today's car buyers tend to switch brands
The Wall Street Journal's "American Way of Buying" survey found that 53% of today's car buyers tend to switch brands.For the survey, Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization each asked about 2,000 U.S. consumers about their buying habits

Cycads, the most popular of which is the Sago Palm, are doll-sized versions of California's famous long-necked palms, with stubby trunks and fern-like fronds.Because the Sago is relatively rare and grows only a couple of inches a year, it's a pricey lawn decoration: A two-foot tall Sago can retail for $1,000, and taller ones often fetch $3,000 or more

The industry has been waiting with bated breath for the machines to come along.that industry executives have until now worried that they would face a severe shortage of programs once consumers begin replacing their TV sets with HDTVs
Japanese electronic giants, such as Sony Corp. and Hitachi Ltd., have focused almost entirely on HDTV hardware, and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition.And only a handful of small U.S. companies are engaged in high-definition software development.that just about 250 hours of HD programming is currently available for airing
its new CCD HDTV converter will help alleviate the problem by allowing programmers and broadcasters to convert movies and television programs shot in 35mm motion-picture film into high-definition video.Consumers will be able to switch on their HDTV sets and get all the viewing benefits the high-tech medium offers
Kodak won't disclose the cost or when its converter will be on the market, but it's estimated the machine may be available within two years.A similar machine already on the market, made by Rank Sintel Ltd., a unit of Rank Organisation, costs about $500,000
And the potential market is tremendous.If HDTV takes off in the U.S., there will be demand for some 4,000 to 5,000 HDTV converters, known in the industry as telecines
If HDTV takes off in the U.S., there will be demand for some 4,000 to 5,000 HDTV converters, known in the industry as telecines.Demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations
that Kodak's move is "a sound marketing decision.They can't afford to stay out of HDTV
Indeed, the stakes are high.that the HDTV market will total about $150 billion over the next two decades, with an additional $400 billion expected to go for related products
But the financial rewards aren't expected soon, nor are they guaranteed.the first sets of HDTVs won't be available for another five to 10 years, and will probably retail for more than $3,000 each in today's dollars
and will probably retail for more than $3,000 each in today's dollars.Some critics say they won't be quickly embraced by consumers because of the high price

This time, the scandal centers on donations made by the not-quite-mainstream pachinko parlor industry.Pachinko, a kind of pinball, is Japan's favorite form of legal gambling
Pachinko, a kind of pinball, is Japan's favorite form of legal gambling.The donations so far appear to be small, especially compared with the huge sums that changed hands in the Recruit Co. influence-peddling scandal that plagued the ruling party last year
Pachinko is slightly on the shady side, often linked to the lower ranks of Japan's underworld and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax evaders.Recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions, and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe
To many Japanese, pachinko is benign or enticingly unsavory.Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country
Garish neon pachinko marquees blaze from the main streets and narrow alleys of cities and towns across the country.Devotees pass hours, watching the lights blink and listening to the metal balls ping, as much to gamble as to get a little time to be anonymous, alone with their thoughts
Devotees pass hours, watching the lights blink and listening to the metal balls ping, as much to gamble as to get a little time to be anonymous, alone with their thoughts.At 500 yen ($3.60) for a handful of balls, pachinko is a common pastime, and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after World War II
If that money were being taxed, it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen.In 1984, an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions
Then, in 1988, a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was fielded in parliament.The proposal split the industry in two, along the lines of national origin: North Koreans oppose the plan while South Koreans, Japanese and Taiwanese accept it or are neutral
In August, a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization donated money to Japan Socialist Party members.The magazine alleged that in making the donations, the pachinko industry may have been offering bribes to win support in the battle against prepaid cards, or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the JSP and the North Korean residents' organization, the Chosen Soren
But the press kept it alive; as with the Recruit scandal, lists began circulating with names of people who had received money
The JSP admitted Oct. 13 that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization, and charged LDP members with receiving 125 million yen ($880,000) and other opposition parties with taking about 2.5 million yen.On Friday, the chief cabinet secretary announced that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry, including 450,000 yen ($3,175) by Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu

making direct donations.They say its possible some of their members may be donating privately
The issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent Korean residents, those residents were largely born and raised in Japan and many speak only Japanese.That they retain Korean citizenship and ties is a reflection of history -- their parents were shipped in as laborers during the decades when Japan occupied Korea before World War II -- and the discrimination that still faces Koreans in Japanese society

Yet Mr. McDuffie's career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known contemporaries.During the late 1970s, he was part of a musical "brat pack" -- a group of budding virtuosos who studied at the Juilliard School with the noted pedagogue Dorothy DeLay
During the late 1970s, he was part of a musical "brat pack" -- a group of budding virtuosos who studied at the Juilliard School with the noted pedagogue Dorothy DeLay.His violin classmates included Shlomo Mintz, a protege of Isaac Stern who performed with major orchestras while still a student; Cho-Liang Lin, who joined the roster of ICM Artists Inc. at the age of 18; and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, who launched her career by winning the 1981 Naumberg Competition

That's the most important experience I've had with any teacher because she taught me how to listen.Now, when I play with orchestras, the musicians often compliment me on my intonation
It was also at Juilliard that Mr. McDuffie discovered his predilection for conservative, 20th-century American composers such as David Diamond and Samuel Barber.After winning a school competition with a performance of the latter's "Violin Concerto," Mr. McDuffie was invited to play the work for the composer, who was dying of cancer

His performance was so effusive and driven that the phrases rarely breathed.The 35-member Sinfonia played adroitly with a big, lush sound that belied its size
Whatever he plays, Mr. McDuffie finds satisfaction in the music itself -- "something greater out there than me," as he puts it during an interview at the Manhattan apartment he shares with wife, Camille, a literary publicist. "A normal person did not write the Beethoven `Violin Concerto

A lot of observers think so, and, if they're right, the whole economy as well as the spendthrifts among us could be hurt.A sudden, forced cutback by consumers would damp the economy at a time when plant-and-equipment spending is slowing and deficit-racked governments can't readily take up the slack
The worriers cite some worrisome trends.During the almost seven-year-old economic expansion, inflation-adjusted gross national product, disposable personal income and personal consumption expenditures have risen 30%, but inflation-adjusted consumer installment credit has surged 66%
However, these figures don't seem to worry Thomas A. Durkin, an economist at the Federal Reserve Board.In a paper presented at the recent annual meeting of the National Association of Business Economists in San Francisco, Mr. Durkin comments that "installment credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances, and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier experiences
that "installment credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances, and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier experiences.We are now witnessing a slowdown which, if history is a guide, could persist for a while
But what about the debt burden.that "there is some magic level" at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income "indicates economic problems
The chart below shows why (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 23, 1989).The ratio of consumer installment credit to disposable income, though up a bit, hasn't climbed steeply, and such debt as a percent of household assets is little changed
Moreover, the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be "lower in this cycle than earlier.that some "revolving credit-card credit is actually convenience credit" being used simply as a handy way of paying bills rather than a handy way of borrowing
And much home-equity credit is used conservatively. "The most frequent use is home improvement, which presumably improves the value of the property
that consumers, conservative as ever, are already clutching their purses a bit more tightly.In July, consumer installment credit outstanding fell for the first time since January 1987

The intimate apparel industry is perceived to be a growth industry and clearly {Maidenform} is a force to be reckoned with.Although working women are "forced to wear the uniform of the day, to retain their femininity they are buying better quality, more upscale intimate apparel
Although Mr. Brawer's appointment as president was long expected, the move on Sept. 25 precipitated the resignation of Alan Lesk as senior vice president of sales and merchandising.Three days later, Mr. Lesk was named president and chief executive officer of Olga Co., a competing intimate apparel division of Warnaco Inc
that after spending 24 years at Maidenform, Mr. Lesk, 48, made it clear he wanted the top job. "If you want the presidency of the company, this isn't the firm to work for
The company downplayed the loss of Mr. Lesk and split his merchandising responsibilities among a committee of four people. "My style is less informal," Mr. Brawer says
Top officers insist Maidenform's greatest strength is its family ownership. "You can't go anywhere in this company and find an organizational chart," one delights

The company could command a good price in the market. "Over the past three and a half years, apparel companies, many of whom have strong brand names, have been bought at about 60% of sales

Her father, William Rosenthal, designed the then-dress making company's first bra in the 1920s, which he said gave women a "maiden form" compared with the "boyish form" they got from the "flat bandages" used for support at the time.While Mr. Rosenthal introduced new undergarment designs, his wife, Ida, concentrated on sales and other financial matters

According to the report, completed last month, if China's trade gap continues to widen at the pace seen in the first seven months of this year, the reserves would be wiped out either in 1990 or 1991.A country is considered financially healthy if its reserves cover three months of its imports
A country is considered financially healthy if its reserves cover three months of its imports.The $14 billion of reserves China had in June would cover just that much
But before import growth slowed, China's buying spree in the first half already had taken its toll on foreign-exchange reserves.The $14 billion level in June marked a drop from $19 billion at the end of April
The $14 billion level in June marked a drop from $19 billion at the end of April.China's last big import binge sent reserves tumbling to $10.6 billion in June 1985 from $16.6 billion the previous September
For example, China's hard-currency income is expected to suffer from the big drop in tourist arrivals since June 4.Revenue from tourism this year is projected to total $1.3 billion, down from $2.2 billion last year
Revenue from tourism this year is projected to total $1.3 billion, down from $2.2 billion last year.Because of this and the huge trade gap, the deficit in China's current account, which measures trade in goods and services plus certain unilateral transfers of funds, is expected to widen sharply from the $3.8 billion deficit last year
In one, imports and exports continue to grow at the respective average rates of 25% and 5% recorded during the first seven months, and the current-account deficit widens to $13.1 billion.In 1985, China had a record deficit of $11.4 billion
The other scenario assumes that Beijing takes effective actions to curb imports in the coming months.In this case, China would still finish the year with a current-account deficit of $8.7 billion, based on projections that imports for all of this year grow 20% and exports 10%
But since June, foreign bankers led by international financial institutions have virtually suspended their new loans to China.Even if borrowing resumes, commercial bankers aren't expected to lend as much as before
In addition, economists are forecasting a slowdown in foreign direct investments as businessmen become increasingly wary of China's deteriorating political and economic environment.On top of all this, foreign-debt repayments are expected to peak in 1991 to 1992
With less capital coming in, China's balance of payments would suffer.The Western government report's first scenario assumes a 30% reduction in foreign borrowing and a 5% contraction in foreign direct investment
The Western government report's first scenario assumes a 30% reduction in foreign borrowing and a 5% contraction in foreign direct investment.In the second, foreign borrowing is projected to grow 10% and investment to drop 10%
But in either case, the report says, China's balance of payments would rapidly dry up foreign reserves, which are used to finance the imbalance.In the first scenario, the reserves would be exhausted next year, and in the second they would be wiped out in 1991

But knowing that mechanics would probably ground him for repairs, Mr. Brown skipped his stop in nearby Chicago and set course to get his load -- a few hundred parcels -- to the Memphis package-sorting hub on time.Had he been a little less gung-ho, "I'd have gotten the thing on the ground and headed for the nearest bar

Like Mr. Brown, they sometimes go to surprising lengths to meet that overarching corporate goal: delivering the goods on time.They are a tribute to Federal's management which, since the company's founding 16 years ago, has had its way with its work force -- an unusual feat in the contentious transportation industry
That may soon change.This month, Federal's 2,048 pilots, including some 961 acquired along with Tiger International Inc. in February, will decide whether to elect the powerful Air Line Pilots Association as their bargaining agent
This month, Federal's 2,048 pilots, including some 961 acquired along with Tiger International Inc. in February, will decide whether to elect the powerful Air Line Pilots Association as their bargaining agent.The election, which would bring the first major union to Federal's U.S. operations, has pitted new hires against devoted veterans such as Mr. Brown
A union, sooner or later, has to have an adversary, and it has to have a victory.In our formula, we don't have any losers except the competition
What managers really fear is that the pro-union movement could spread beyond the pilots.Under federal transportation law, a government mediator is attempting to reconcile the melding of Tiger's job classifications into Federal's.Depending on the outcome, the merged company may face union elections this fall among airplane mechanics, ramp workers, stock clerks and flight dispatchers

He also lets workers vent steam through an elaborate grievance procedure and, as a perk, fly free in empty cockpit seats.He gives pep talks in periodic "family briefings" beamed internationally on "FXTV," the company's own television network
And, with many of his 70,000 workers, Mr. Smith's damn-the-torpedoes attitude has caught on.James Cleveland, a courier who earned a Bravo Zulu for figuring out how to get a major customer's 1,100-parcel-a-week load to its doorstep by 8 a.m., considers himself far more than a courier

David Sanders, a longtime pilot, bristles at the mere suggestion that a union might tamper with his flight schedule. "This is America," he says
This is America.Nobody has the right to tell me how much I can work
but to keep its work force extraordinarily lean.The company deliberately understaffs, stretching employees' schedules to the limit
But though couriers work as many as 60 hours a week during the autumn rush, they leave early during slack times while still being assured of a minimum paycheck.Pilots, as well, routinely fly overtime to ensure that none are furloughed during seasonal lows
The operational freedom has also given Federal a leg up on archrival United Parcel Service Inc., the nation's largest employer of United Brotherhood of Teamsters members.UPS won't discuss its labor practices, but, according to Mr. Cleveland, a former UPS employee, and others, union work rules prohibit UPS drivers from doing more than carrying packages between customers and their vans
but, according to Mr. Cleveland, a former UPS employee, and others, union work rules prohibit UPS drivers from doing more than carrying packages between customers and their vans.Because UPS drivers aren't permitted to load their own vehicles at the depot packages often get buried in the load and are delivered late
Labor problems are the last thing Mr. Smith needs right now.Although the Tiger acquisition has brought Federal a long way toward becoming the global player it wants to be, it also has brought problems
Although the Tiger acquisition has brought Federal a long way toward becoming the global player it wants to be, it also has brought problems.It more than doubled Federal's long-term debt to $1.9 billion, thrust the company into unknown territory -- heavy cargo -- and suddenly expanded its landing rights to 21 countries from four

These and other problems squeezed Federal's profit margins last year to 8%, down from more than 13% annually in the first half of the decade.Earnings have plummeted, too, in each of the past three quarters
Earnings have plummeted, too, in each of the past three quarters.In the fiscal first period ended Aug. 31, profit fell 54% to $30.4 million, or 58 cents a share, mostly because of the Tiger merger
Federal's stock price, however, has held up well, driven in part by the general run-up of airline stocks.Since trading as low as $42.25 a share in May, Federal's shares have rallied as high as $57.87 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading

There's a certain irony in the fact that Federal Express faces its first union problems as a result of its Tiger purchase.Tiger itself was founded by a band of gungho airmen who had airlifted supplies "over the Hump" from India to China during World War II
Tiger itself was founded by a band of gungho airmen who had airlifted supplies "over the Hump" from India to China during World War II.In the early 1970s, Mr. Smith modeled his fledgling company on Tiger's innovation of hub-and-spoke and containerized-cargo operations
it will pay off eventually.Federal's earnings to improve again in its fiscal third quarter ending Feb. 28
Analysts expect Federal's earnings to improve again in its fiscal third quarter ending Feb. 28, when the company should begin benefiting from Tiger's extra flights, back-up planes and landing rights.Until then, they expect the cost of integrating the two carriers to continue crimping profits
For now, the union issue is the most nettlesome of Federal's Tiger problems.Although encouraging dialogue between managers and workers, Mr. Smith doesn't countenance what he considers insubordination
Although encouraging dialogue between managers and workers, Mr. Smith doesn't countenance what he considers insubordination.When a large group of pilots once signed petitions opposing work-rule and compensation changes, he called a meeting in a company hangar and dressed them down for challenging his authority
That sort of approach, however, hasn't worked since the addition of Tiger.Its 6,500 workers, who had battled Tiger's management for years over givebacks, were union members until the day of the merger, when most of their unions were automatically decertified
Soon after the merger, moreover, Federal's management asked Tiger's pilots to sign an agreement stating that they could be fired any time, without cause or notice.When the pilots refused, the company retracted it
Mr. Smith angered Federal's pilots, too.In his haste to seal the deal with Tiger Chairman Saul Steinberg last August, Mr. Smith ignored a promise that he had made to his own pilots three years ago: that any fliers acquired in future mergers would be "end-tailed" -- put at the bottom of the pilot seniority list that determines work schedules, pay and career options
that any fliers acquired in future mergers would be "end-tailed" -- put at the bottom of the pilot seniority list that determines work schedules, pay and career options.The Tiger merger agreement stipulated that the lists be combined on the basis of tenure
his charisma and popularity among the many former military fliers could be tough to beat. "A lot of people are identifying a vote for representation as a vote against Fred Smith

our contract with our pilots says that we will manage our fleet operations with their advice.It doesn't give any particular group the ability to veto change
Already, the fight has been costly.The seniority-list controversy, along with the job-classification dispute, has been turned over to the mediator
The issue has also cost Federal management a lot of good will among its old pilots. "They were willing to mistreat us because we hadn't shown any moxie, any resistance," says William Queenan, a DC-10 pilot and 14-year Federal veteran
They were willing to mistreat us because we hadn't shown any moxie, any resistance," says William Queenan, a DC-10 pilot and 14-year Federal veteran.Adds John Poag, a 727 captain and past chairman of the company-sponsored Flight Advisory Board: "They've made all these magnanimous gestures to the Flying Tiger pilots, and for us, nothing
Such animosity could prove pivotal in the union vote.A large majority of the 961 former Tiger fliers support the union, according to a union study.But though most of the 1,087 Federal pilots are believed opposed, it is unclear just how much their loyalty to Mr. Smith has been eroded
The fight has turned ugly and, among pilots at least, has shattered the esprit de corps that Mr. Smith worked so hard to build.Anti-union pilots have held ballot-burning parties
Anti-union pilots have held ballot-burning parties.Some younger pilots say they have had to endure anti-union harangues by senior pilots while flying across the country

In that context, Robert Loggia's riveting performance as the unlovable -- even crotchety -- veteran agent seems a better franchise for a series than most.Week by week on "Mancuso FBI" (NBC, Fridays, 10 p.m. ET), he pokes around the crime styles of the rich, famous and powerful of the Washington scene -- a loose cannon on deck at the FBI

it also has a major flaw: It's wildly overwritten.Executive Producers Steve Sohmer and Jeff Bleckner (and writer/producers Ken Solarz and Steve Bello) have revved this show up to the breaking point

One more word and you are out on a park bench, mister

The National Security Council itself was established in 1947 because policy makers sensed a need, in an increasingly complex world, for a formal system within the White House to make sure that communications flowed smoothly between the president and the State Department, Pentagon and intelligence agencies.By law, the council includes the president, vice president and secretaries of state and defense

That task is one of Washington's perennial problems.In the Bush White House, the size of the NSC's staff of professional officers is down to about 50 from about 70 in 1987, administration officials say
But one clear problem during the coup attempt was that the NSC staffer most experienced in Latin America, Everett Briggs, was gone.He had just resigned, at least in part because of a feud with Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson over the administration's policy on Panama and support for Nicaragua's Contra rebels
The absence of Mr. Briggs underscored the possible inadequacy of the current NSC staff.Both Gen. Scowcroft and his deputy, Robert Gates, are experts in U.S.-Soviet affairs
Gen. Scowcroft is particularly well-versed in arms control, and Mr. Gates has spent years studying Soviet politics and society.Both have become confidants of President Bush
Frank Lavelle, who at the time was the marketing director for Sperry in Clearwater, Fla., admitted participating in a scheme to bribe Garland Tomlin, the Navy official.Mr. Tomlin, who left the Navy in 1985, pleaded guilty earlier this year to related conspiracy, bribery and tax-evasion charges
The bribery scheme took place between 1982 and 1985, according to documents filed by prosecutors in connection with Mr. Lavelle's guilty plea in federal district court in Alexandria, Va.Sperry merged with Burroughs Corp. to become Unisys Corp. in late 1986
Mr. Tomlin tried to steer to Sperry a multimillion dollar contract to computerize maintenance of certain Navy electronics equiment.Mr. Tomlin, among other things, illegally provided Mr. Lavelle with inside information and documents intended to give Sperry an unfair advantage in the competition

Ford faces an uphill fight for Jaguar, however.they expect to have a friendly alliance with GM wrapped up by the end of the month
GM, meanwhile, is hosting a delegation of members of the British Parliament who are touring the auto maker's headquarter operations in Detroit.the visit isn't connected to the Jaguar situation
since the company's gilded brand image would give Ford a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both Europe and the U.S. Last week, Ford encountered a setback in its effort to broaden its U.S. luxury offerings when it was forced to abandon a four-year-old effort to market its German-built Scorpio sedan in the U.S. as a luxury import under the Merkur brand name
So despite the GM-Jaguar romance, analysts say Ford by last Friday had boosted its Jaguar holding to about 11% of the luxury auto maker's shares outstanding from 10.4% early last week.About 5.4 million Jaguar shares changed hands in active trading on London's stock exchange Friday, and Jaguar shares moved up 19 pence to 696 pence ($11

For Mr. Jones, it was just the beginning.He quickly cut the team's bloated administrative staff by half, shut down a Cowboys-owned dance academy and, in July, announced plans to sell Valley Ranch, the team's 30-acre practice camp and the most lavish training facility in the NFL

The place costs nearly $2 million a year to maintain.When he sells it, he says, the Cowboys will move to a more practical -- read affordable -- grass practice field near Texas Stadium
And as for Tom Landry, well he had played out his winning years.After posting losing seasons in each of the last three years, the Cowboys needed a change
Football has long been Mr. Jones's passion, both on and off the field.An Arkansas native, he started at guard on the undefeated 1964 University of Arkansas team that won a national championship

After college, he worked at his father's insurance company in Little Rock.Years later, with cash from the sale of the insurance company, he founded Arkoma Production Corp., an oil and gas exploration company based in Little Rock
So it wasn't surprising that Mr. Jones returned to his Arkansas roots when he went looking for a replacement for Mr. Landry.He tapped Jimmy Johnson, a teammate on the 1964 University of Arkansas squad and the head coach at the University of Miami
where he led the Hurricanes to five winning seasons and a national championship in 1987.Whatever Mr. Johnson's talents, in the hearts and minds of many Dallas fans, he is no Tom Landry
Whatever Mr. Johnson's talents, in the hearts and minds of many Dallas fans, he is no Tom Landry.Seven games (and, after a loss to the Kansas City Chiefs yesterday, seven losses) into the season, the "new" Cowboys aren't doing any better than the old
In fact, the last time they played this badly was in 1960, their opening season.Average attendance at their games, about 49,000 last year, continues flat
Mr. Jones is attacking the problem on several fronts.He continues to reshuffle the team, trading famed running back Herschel Walker to the Minnesota Vikings this month for a slew of players and future draft picks
He continues to reshuffle the team, trading famed running back Herschel Walker to the Minnesota Vikings this month for a slew of players and future draft picks.To try to draw more fans, he has dropped end-zone ticket prices from $25 to $19
But the general trend, given rising costs in the league, has been to raise prices, and Mr. Jones is expected to eventually follow suit. "It's simple," says Lamar Hunt, who owns the Kansas City Chiefs and last year raised ticket prices by $2.40 to an average $17
It's simple.If we didn't increase prices, we'd be in the red
Mr. Jones has also beefed up his marketing staff to sell the 118 luxury suites topping Texas Stadium (his deal with Bum Bright included operating rights for the stadium).The suites are air-conditioned, have wet bars and plush seating, and offer a clear view of the field -- all for a sale price of $475,000 to $1 million, depending on their size and location

The biggest is the NFL's contract with national television for broadcast of the league's games.Last year, the Cowboys' share of that pie came to $17.6 million
The team additionally earns between $2 million and $4 million for local radio and television broadcast rights.Mr. Jones is currently trying to jack up the price for those local rights
Mr. Jones is resigned to the hefty salaries he pays his players these days.He calls the contracts "critical to winning in the NFL" and has played his part in the bidding wars
and has played his part in the bidding wars.Besides signing Mr. Aikman to a sizable contract, Mr. Jones has agreed to pay rookie quarterback Steve Walsh $4.1 million over the next four years

How interestingly clever of Robert Goldberg to use the form of pretend advocacy journalism to explain his perception of "Days of Rage" in his television critique (Leisure & Arts, Sept 11).He chastises Jo Franklin-Trout for her inept presentation of advocacy journalism, judging her project as "intellectually slipshod
He chastises Jo Franklin-Trout for her inept presentation of advocacy journalism, judging her project as "intellectually slipshod." Was not the title very clear
One example he gives: "She didn't ask" (why the Palestinian children are soldiers throwing stones).Really now, did she have to ask
Mr. Goldberg contends that even as "propaganda" the film fails because it presents only one view.Of course the Palestinians complain about their treatment
Of course the Palestinians complain about their treatment; of course the Israelis feel put upon
But his complaint that "Days of Rage" doesn't contain balanced comments from Israelis about how badly the Palestinians are behaving is irrelevant.It's like doing a documentary on apartheid and insisting that equal time be given to how terrific white South Africans are

It's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs.That isn't consistent with the kind of discipline that Gramm-Rudman is supposed to impose
The president's request didn't indicate how Mr. Cheney would shift the money.A Pentagon official said the request was made to give the department "maximum flexibility" to deal with the cuts
Last week, Budget Director Richard Darman structured the $16.1 billion spending reduction, half of which must come from defense, to "impose a little bit more discipline" by applying cuts to each individual program, project or activity in the budget.That would give agencies "less ability . . . to fudge over things

The bridge loans are intended to provide temporary financing for acquisitions.Since such loans are often refinanced through the sale of high-risk, high-yield junk bonds, the recent woes of the junk-bond market have renewed concerns among regulators about the risks associated with Wall Street firms issuing bridge loans
But some Wall Street executives argue that such fears are unwarranted.In a July 6 letter to the Senate Securities Subcommittee, First Boston Corp. argued that the fact that no retail brokerage firm failed during the 1987 market crash demonstrates that current rules are adequate

In fact, the generation of painters growing into maturity right now works with such profoundly held humanist assumptions and such passionate commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes Che Guevara's famous linkages of art, idealism and revolution seem modest.It is on behalf of these people, and out of my real respect for them, that I am responding to Mr. Asman's opinions of their country
Mr. Asman should make distinctions among Fidel, the army and the Cuban people.They are not interchangeable
They are not interchangeable, since they are motivated to act based on their own circumstances.It is naivete to equate a government's policies with the will of the people
Mr. Asman is also annoyed that Mr. Castro has resisted collaboration with U.S. officials, even though by his own account that collaboration has been devised essentially as a mechanism for acts directly hostile to the Cuban regime, such as facilitating defections.I think it's a little disingenuous to be surprised that Fidel doesn't invite the U.S. State Department to violate the jurisdiction of the Cuban government over its own territory
We badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom.Without this basic level of attention to reality, our policies on Cuba will continue to be as counterproductive as they have for 30 years

They continued to represent that to the board.We were reassured they would stand behind the company
but the request was turned down by an unidentified lender on Oct. 14.At that point Qintex Australia stated it would "endeavor to arrange" the financing
that his company had opposed the Chapter 11 filing.He said the company believed Qintex Entertainment's financial problems could have been resolved by other means
The report of the bankruptcy filing stunned Hollywood executives and investors. "It's a shocker," said Joseph Di Lillo, chairman of Drake Capital Securities, a brokerage firm that has an investment in Qintex Entertainment
It's a shocker.Qintex Australia was "going to pay more than $1 billion for MGM/UA and then they couldn't come up with the far smaller sum of $5.9 million
Qintex said Mr. Evans, the former president, resigned for "personal reasons" and that Mr. Kimmel, an attorney, resigned because his participation in evaluating the company's role in buying MGM/UA was no longer necessary.Mr. Kimmel was a director of the company and a predecessor firm since 1980

The ministry has never even suggested that Japanese banks be cautious about leveraged buy-outs in general.There are no facts {behind the assertions} that we sent any kind of signal
The comments were the ministry's first detailed public statement on the subject, and reflect the ministry's concern that foreigners will think Japan is using its tremendous financial power to control events in foreign markets.A number of accounts of the events leading to the 190 point drop in New York stock prices on Oct. 13 accused the ministry of pulling the plug on the UAL deal for one reason or another
Mr. Utsumi said the most the ministry had ever done was ask Japanese banks about "the status of their participation" in one previous U.S. leveraged buy-out.The ministry inquired about that deal -- which Mr. Utsumi declined to identify -- because the large presence of Japanese banks in the deal was "being strongly criticized in the U.S. Congress" and it was "necessary for us to grasp the situation

Still, Mr. Utsumi may have a hard time convincing market analysts who have rightly or wrongly believed that the ministry played a role in orchestrating recent moves by Japanese banks.All week there has been much speculation in financial circles in Tokyo and abroad about the ministry's real position
The {ministry} thinks the banks don't know what they are doing, that they have very little idea how to cope with risk.The {ministry} wants to see the Japanese banks pull in their horns" on leveraged buy-outs
they have a hard time believing that commercial considerations were the only reason.Japanese banks are under "political pressure" as well
Clearly, some financial authorities are concerned about the Japanese banks role in leveraged buy-outs.At a news conference this week, Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita cautioned banks to take a "prudent" stance regarding highly leveraged deals
At a news conference this week, Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita cautioned banks to take a "prudent" stance regarding highly leveraged deals.Despite Mr. Sumita's statements, it is the Finance Ministry, not the central bank, that makes policy decisions

In the Missouri case, unforeseen consequences may have arisen because the high court reinstated the preamble of the state's 1986 abortion law.The preamble says that human life begins at conception and that unborn children have rights protected by the Constitution
their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of unborn children.Under a 1981 Missouri law, persons accused of some crimes, including trespassing, may offer a defense that their actions were justified "as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury
Under a 1981 Missouri law, persons accused of some crimes, including trespassing, may offer a defense that their actions were justified "as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury." Relying on the preamble's statement that a fetus is an unborn child, the two St. Louis County Circuit Court judges in August accepted the justification that the abortion clinic protesters were trying to save lives
In another case, a protester, Ann O'Brien, was convicted of trespass before the Supreme Court's Webster ruling.Last week, when her appeal was argued before the Missouri Court of Appeals, her lawyer also relied on the preamble
The effect of the Supreme Court Webster opinion is that it left room for grass to grow in the cracks of Roe vs.Wade, and I think this is one of the cracks," said Mark Belz, a St. Louis lawyer who represented Ms. O'Brien and the other St. Louis protesters.Roe vs.Wade was the Supreme Court's 1973 decision that recognized a woman's right to abortion

On Sept. 7, I wrote on these pages about the killing and capturing of 10,000 Ethiopian soldiers by Eritrean and Tigrean guerrillas.Recently, in Wollo province in the center of Ethiopia, Tigrean forces have killed, wounded and captured an additional 20,000 government troops
Recently, in Wollo province in the center of Ethiopia, Tigrean forces have killed, wounded and captured an additional 20,000 government troops. (Think what these numbers mean -- considering the headline space devoted to hundreds of deaths in Lebanon, a small country of little strategic importance

The weaker he gets, the more he turns toward the U.S. for help.While the Tigreans are communists, like the Eritreans they are among the most anti-Soviet guerrillas in the world
The State Department, to its credit, has already begun distancing itself from Mr. Barre, evinced by its decision to publish the Gersony report (which the press has ignored).What's more, the U.S. has suspended $2.5 million in military aid and $1 million in economic aid
But this is not enough.Because the U.S. is still perceived to be tied to Mr. Barre, when he goes the runway could go too
when he goes the runway could go too.Considering how tenuous the security of that runway is anyway, the better option -- both morally and strategically -- would be for the Bush administration to blast the regime publicly, in terms clear enough for all influential Somalis to understand

Remember that it took Mr. Mengistu many months to topple Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 and 1975.There is simply no way to engineer a succession covertly
But the U.S. has one great advantage: The Soviets are universally loathed throughout Ethiopia for what they did to the country this past decade -- famine and all
It's not just in Eastern Europe where the march of events is finally on the U.S. side, but on the horn of Africa as well.The only U.S. liability in the region is what remains of the link to Mr. Barre, and that should be cut fast

As a result, the effort by some oil ministers to get OPEC to approve a new permanent production-sharing agreement next month is taking on increasing urgency.The organization is scheduled to meet in Vienna beginning Nov. 25
OPEC is currently producing more than 22 million barrels a day, sharply above its nominal, self-imposed fourth-quarter ceiling of 20.5 million, according to OPEC and industry officials at an oil conference here sponsored by the Oil Daily and the International Herald Tribune.At that rate, a majority of OPEC's 13 members have reached their output limits, they said
But it is estimated that at least three million barrels a day -- and possibly as much as seven million barrels a day -- of spare capacity still exists within OPEC.Most is concentrated in five Persian Gulf countries, including his own, Issam Al-Chalabi, Iraq's oil minister, told the conference Friday
Most is concentrated in five Persian Gulf countries, including his own, Issam Al-Chalabi, Iraq's oil minister, told the conference Friday.He puts OPEC's current capacity at 28 million to 29 million barrels a day
That's higher than some other estimates.Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister, recently estimated OPEC capacity at 25 million barrels a day
Either way, the overhang is big enough to keep delicately balanced oil markets on edge.Even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves, such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq, could upset the market
Under that approach, countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in OPEC's production ceiling than they would under the current system. "If you are already producing at 95% or 100% of your capacity, what's the good to be told you can produce at 105% of capacity
They doled it out using the existing formula, however.The main effect of the ceiling boost was to "legitimize" some of the overproduction already coming from the quota cheaters
In the end politics got in the way.Libya accepted Iran's proposal only so long as it was promised production parity with Kuwait
several compromises already have been worked into the plan.The ceiling would be lifted to 21.5 million barrels to provide Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates much higher official quotas while reducing percentage shares of some others
The ceiling would be lifted to 21.5 million barrels to provide Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates much higher official quotas while reducing percentage shares of some others.Libya's previous conditions are no longer considered a problem, although the United Arab Emirates is still an issue
Saudi Arabia, OPEC's kingpin, also has surfaced as a possible obstacle.Insisting on a 24.5% share of any ceiling, Saudi officials have long pressed for the pro rata distribution of increases to all members
Some of the proposed modifications since, however, call on Saudi Arabia to "give back" to the production-sharing pool a token 23,000 barrels.Though tiny, that's a reduction in its share

the navy still intends to buy 86 Rafales as scheduled in the late 1990s and early 21st century.The air force is to take at least 250 more
the navy can't wait until 1998, when the naval Rafale becomes available, to replace its obsolete fleet of American-made Crusaders.Rather than renovate the Crusaders the navy wants to buy used F-18s from the U.S. Navy
Officially, the statement isn't an attack on the Rafale.Adm. Goupil said that when the F-18s wear out, the navy is prepared to take Rafales to replace them
But unofficially, senior navy officials sharply criticize the Rafale as an air force plane ill-suited to carrier use.Although they never said so publicly, they have made no secret of their preference for the F-18 on operational grounds
Adm. Goupil's comments are likely to inflame the broader dispute within the military establishment here over the role of Dassault.Although government-controlled, Dassault still is run by the founder's son, Chairman Serge Dassault, who has fiercely protected his company's independence

Adm. Goupil, a former Crusader squadron leader, said that the last other country to use Crusaders, the Philippines, retired its last ones two years ago.A French Crusader crash a few months ago heightened pressure for new planes here

Cathay also is moving some of its labor-intensive data-processing operations outside Hong Kong.Fierce bidding for young employees in Hong Kong is pushing up Cathay's labor costs by 20% a year for low-level staff, while experienced, skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain

Although the June 4 killings in Beijing have hurt its China flights, Cathay's other routes have retained high load factors.Mr. Eddington regards promoting Hong Kong as an important part of attracting visitors from Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, where the number of people looking to travel abroad has surged
There also has been speculation that Cathay will be among the major private-sector participants in the Hong Kong government's plans to build a new airport, with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal.Cathay officials decline to comment on the speculation
But he emphasizes that Cathay hasn't any interest in swapping equity stakes with the U.S. carrier or with Lufthansa, the West German airline with which it has cooperated for about a decade.Analysts believe Cathay is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis, particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among European carriers

But this way, American will coordinate good extensions to Boston, New York, Chicago and Dallas.We'll coordinate on this end to places like Bangkok, Singapore and Manila
Asian traffic is expected to continue as the carrier's mainstay.Cathay has long stated its desire to double its weekly flights into China to 14, and it is applying to restart long-canceled flights into Vietnam
the airline is putting its faith in the Sino-British agreement on Hong Kong's return to China.A special section dealing with aviation rights states that landing rights for Hong Kong's airlines will continue to be negotiated by Hong Kong's government
{Cathay doesn't} have a hope in the long run.Cathay would love to keep going, but the general sense is they're going to have to do something

Profits are also plowed back into the community; the non-profit Vermont-Slauson Economic Development Corp. receives 60% of the profits from the Vermont-Slauson Center and uses the money to provide moderate and low-cost housing in the community as well as commercial and industrial development projects
There is no question that Vermont-Slauson had a halo effect on the surrounding neighborhood.What had been a deteriorated area with nothing but wig shops and shoe shops is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock, thanks to a continuously replenished source of revitalization capital that Vermont-Slauson yields

First Interstate took a huge $350 million provision for loan losses at the Arizona bank.It charged off an estimated $200 million of Arizona loans, leaving the unit with a reserve for future losses of $255 million, about 61% of its $416 million of troubled loans and repossessed real estate
First Interstate made the move under pressure from regulators.The action capped a spurt of grim Arizona banking news for the third quarter, and emphatically signaled that Arizona is challenging Texas's long reign as banking's busiest graveyard
The action capped a spurt of grim Arizona banking news for the third quarter, and emphatically signaled that Arizona is challenging Texas's long reign as banking's busiest graveyard.Earlier last week, Valley National Corp., the state's largest locally owned banking company, reported a $72.2 million loss and suspended its dividend

regulators have concluded that lenders' reserves are far too low to absorb their future Arizona losses.Examiners from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency had been combing through First Interstate's real-estate portfolio since last month
they first recommended that First Interstate take a provision that was less than the eventual $350 million third-quarter hit.When First Interstate balked regulators responded by raising their recommendation to $350 million
At that point, {First Interstate} decided it was the better part of valor not to negotiate further," said one industry official close to the talks.Thomas P. Marrie, chief financial officer, wouldn't comment about the details of the negotiations

The tough regulatory stance portends large future losses, especially at the state's thrifts.At least six of Arizona's 12 savings and loan institutions have either been taken over by the government's conservatorship program or are essentially insolvent
At least six of Arizona's 12 savings and loan institutions have either been taken over by the government's conservatorship program or are essentially insolvent; they are sitting on enormous unrecognized losses
For example, Western Savings & Loan Association had tangible capital-assets minus liabilities -- of a negative $357.4 million at June 30.It had a $258.9 million loss in the second quarter
The rapid deterioration of the Arizona thrifts only adds to the ever-swelling cost of the government's massive thrift bailout, officially estimated at about $166 billion.Together, the six government-controlled or essentially insolvent Arizona thrifts have tangible capital of a negative $1.5 billion, foreclosed property of $1.8 billion and pastdue loans of $1.63 billion
They have no reserves against the real estate, and their reserves against the loans are miniscule compared with the levels of reserves banks are moving to set up.The thrifts had a combined loss of $487.8 million in the second quarter
The thrifts had a combined loss of $487.8 million in the second quarter.Other lenders have been recovering only 50 cents to 60 cents on the dollar on foreclosed Arizona property, if they can sell it at all
All this havoc is the result of one of the worst busts in Arizona's boom-and-bust history, compounded by some of the usual suspects in 1980s banking debacles: greed, fraud and plain bad banking.In the late 1970s and early 1980s, lenders and developers poured money into office buildings, condominiums and massive tracts of raw desert land, confident that Arizona's population would grow at annual rates of 4% to 6% for years to come
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, lenders and developers poured money into office buildings, condominiums and massive tracts of raw desert land, confident that Arizona's population would grow at annual rates of 4% to 6% for years to come.Now, annual population growth is running at about 2% a year, some desert tracts bought three years ago for $90,000 an acre are being sold at $25,000 an acre and Phoenix has a seven-year supply of unoccupied office space

Ralph Shattuck, publisher of Foreclosure Update newsletter, said foreclosures have climbed to about 1,482 a month just in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located.That's up from about 687 a month in 1985, and it's accelerating: So far this month, foreclosures are averaging about 85 a day

Conner dominates the market for hard-disk drives used to store data in laptop computers.that net income for its third quarter soared 72% to $11.8 million, or 28 cents a share, from $6.8 million, or 19 cents a share, in the year-ago period
It said yesterday that net income for its third quarter soared 72% to $11.8 million, or 28 cents a share, from $6.8 million, or 19 cents a share, in the year-ago period.Its revenue totaled $184.4 million, an increase of 172% from $67.8 million a year ago
For the nine months net income jumped 84% to $26.9 million, or 69 cents a share, from $14.6 million, or 43 cents a share.Revenue nearly tripled to $479 million, from $160 million
Analysts expect Conner's earnings to reach roughly $40 million, or $1 to $1.05 a share, on sales of $650 million, for 1989, the company's third full year in business.That's a faster growth rate than reported by Compaq
Conner's performance is closely tied to the burgeoning demand for battery-operated computers, the computer industry's fastest-growing segment.Since its inception, Conner has both benefited from and helped make possible the rapid spread of portable computers by selling storage devices that consume five to 10 times less electricity than drives used in desktop machines
Today, Conner controls an estimated 90% of the hard-disk drive market for laptop computers.The company supplies drives to Compaq and Zenith Data Systems, the top two U.S. manufacturers of laptops, and to Toshiba Corp., NEC Corp. and Sharp Corp., the leading Japanese laptop makers
In the coming months, however, this is likely to change.Next month, Seagate Technology plans to introduce its first family of low-power drives for battery-operated computers
And the Japanese are likely to keep close on Conner's heels. "They are going to catch up

Two decades ago, the Small Business Administration reported Yale Prof.Albert Reiss's landmark study of crime against 2,500 small businesses drawn from national IRS records.He found that monetary crime losses, as a proportion of gross receipts, were 37 times higher for small businesses than for large ones
The New York study's companies averaged 27 employees; their annual crime losses averaged about $15,000, with an additional $8,385 annual cost in security

Small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs, if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining those businesses.This may help explain why small businesses create 65% of all jobs nationally, but only 22% of jobs in a crime-ridden city like New York
Bigger business can often better afford to minimize the cost of crime.that the cost of security measures in firms with fewer than five employees was almost $1,000 per worker, compared with one-third that amount for firms with more than 10 employees
The shift of retailing to large shopping centers has created even greater economies of scale for providing low-crime business environments.Private security guards and moonlighting police can invoke the law of trespass to regulate access to these quasi-public places
Few small neighborhood businesses, however, can afford such protection, even in collaboration with other local merchants.In the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates, small business generally relies on the public police force for protection

Another solution cities might consider is giving special priority to police patrols of small-business areas.For cities losing business to suburban shopping centers, it may be a wise business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits

Increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such "hot spots" of pedestrian density.With National Institute of Justice support, the Minneapolis police and the Crime Control Institute are currently testing the effects of such a strategy, comparing its deterrence value with traditional random patrols
Small-business patrols would be an especially helpful gesture whenever a small-business person is scheduled to testify against a robbery suspect.While no guarantee, an increased police presence might even deter further attacks

Stock funds, like the market as a whole, generally dropped more than 2% in the week through last Thursday, according to figures compiled by Lipper Analytical Services Inc.That reflects the huge drop a week ago Friday, last Monday's rebound and the dips and blips that followed
But several other types of funds shielded investors from the worst of the market's slide.Funds that invest internationally were the top-performing stock and fixed-income funds

Gold-oriented funds, for instance, which invest in companies that mine and process the precious metal, posted an average decline of 1.15%.Flexible portfolio funds declined at about half the rate of stock funds
Global allocation funds take the asset-allocation concept one step further by investing at least 25% of their portfolios outside the U.S.This gives them the added benefits of international diversification
This gives them the added benefits of international diversification -- including a foreign-exchange boost during periods, like the past week, when the dollar declines against other major currencies.With all that going for them, global flexible portfolio funds declined only 1.07% in the week through last Thursday
there's also a price to pay: A diversified portfolio always underperforms an undiversified portfolio during those times when the investment in the undiversified portfolio is truly hot
By comparison, global asset allocation funds have turned in an average total return of about 19%, while domestic flexible portfolios are up about 17%.Fixed-income funds have returned 8.2%, while gold funds, which tend to be volatile, have risen just 4.55%, on average

there's a lot of unsettlement in this market.interest rates will continue to trend lower

Three International Cash Portfolios funds were among the four top-performing funds in the latest week.Because the funds' investments are denominated in foreign currencies, their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar
But when the dollar rises against major foreign currencies, as it did for much of this year, the dollar value of these funds declines.All three funds posted negative returns for the year to date

Look how much air is moving around.The ventilation here is great
You may be hearing more about the 38-year-old Mr. McDonough and his preoccupation with clean air.After years of relative obscurity, he is starting to attract notice for the ecological as well as the aesthetic quality of his architecture
He has put some of his aesthetic ideas into practice with his design of the four-star Quilted Giraffe restaurant and his remodeling of Paul Stuart, the Madison Avenue clothing store.He has designed furniture and homes as well as commercial and office space
He has put some of his aesthetic ideas into practice with his design of the four-star Quilted Giraffe restaurant -- "architecturally impeccable," Progressive Architecture magazine called it -- and his remodeling of Paul Stuart, the Madison Avenue clothing store.He has designed furniture and homes as well as commercial and office space.He is now designing a Broadway stage set for a show by the band Kid Creole and the Coconuts
What really stirs his muse, though, is aerobic architecture.Now the question is: Is Poland ready for it

If Mr. McDonough has his way, the Poles will compensate for the trade center's emissions of carbon dioxide, a prime suspect in the global atmospheric warming many scientists fear.The Poles would plant a 10-square-mile forest somewhere in the country at a cost of $150,000

Mr. McDonough was born in Tokyo and attended 19 schools in places ranging from Hong Kong to Shaker Heights, Ohio, before entering Dartmouth College.He earned a master's degree in architecture from Yale

Living in Hong Kong made him sensitive to the limits on food, power and water supplies.At his first school in the U.S. he was thought a little strange for shutting off open water taps and admonishing his schoolmates to take only brief showers
He and a Dartmouth roommate established a company that restored three hydroelectric power plants in Vermont.At Yale, he designed one of the first solarheated houses to be built in Ireland
Mr. McDonough's first professional project fully to reflect his environmental ardor was his 1986 design for the headquarters of the Environmental Defense Fund in New York.The offices took 10,000 square feet of a building with 14-foot ceilings and big, operable windows
Since the 1970s energy crisis, some efforts to conserve energy by sealing buildings have had an unintended side effect: high indoor pollution.To reduce it at the fund's building, workers rubbed beeswax instead of polyurethane on the floors in the executive director's office

The ambitious Warsaw project still awaits approval by city officials.Its developer is a Polish American, Sasha Muniak
He had worked with Mr. McDonough on an earlier project and recruited him as architect for the trade center.The center will provide space for computer hardware and facsimile and other telecommunications equipment, not readily accessible in Poland now, for a growing number of Westerners doing business in Eastern Europe

and, traditionally, its mayor is the nation's best-known urban politician.Democrats hoped that Mr. Dinkins could become a highly visible national leader
Democrats hoped that Mr. Dinkins could become a highly visible national leader.Republicans figured that in Mr. Giuliani, the nation's best-known prosecutor, they had a chance for a huge upset in the heart of Democratic territory
Dinkins is a decent but sloppy guy.The alternative -- Giuliani -- is ghastly
I guess we'll reluctantly go ahead and do it, vote for Dinkins.There's nothing on the other side
We're picking up steam.It just hasn't gotten down to the engine room yet
For, just as Mr. Giuliani latches on to an issue that has Mr. Dinkins reeling, his campaign desperately needs cash to keep Mr. Ailes's commercials on the air beyond Wednesday or Thursday.To help out this week, the White House is dispatching chief of staff John Sununu and three Cabinet members -- HUD's Jack Kemp, Transportation's Samuel Skinner and Treasury's Nicholas Brady, according to Peter Powers, the Giuliani campaign manager
For Republicans who began this campaign with such high hopes, all of this is deeply frustrating.Historically, New York is almost always in trouble
But the trouble it faces now under Democratic rule seems bigger and more daunting than anything it has faced in the past.This year, the city faces a budget deficit that could become even bigger next year

More troubling for Mr. Dinkins is his record in personal accounting.It began in 1973, when he was being considered for deputy mayor, and a routine check unearthed the extraordinary fact that he hadn't paid his income tax for the previous four years
And now he's busily trying to explain an arrangement in which he sold stock in Inner City Broadcasting Co., headed by his old friend and patron, Percy Sutton, to his son, David Dinkins Jr., for $58,000.He had valued the shares at more than $1 million two years earlier

The year was already shaping up as a difficult one for the recreational vehicle industry.With the exception of van conversions, the industry has seen a decline from 1988's robust sales
At Winnebago, sales for the quarter fell 6% to $89.5 million from $95.4 million a year earlier.The company attributed the decline to consumers' concern over interest rates and gas prices -- two key expenses for RV buyers
Winnebago was hit especially hard in the latest downturn because unit sales in its bread-and-butter motor home business tumbled 25% industrywide in August, and 10.4% in the first eight months of the year.it also suffered in the quarter from incentive programs, losses from discontinuing a motor home line and costs of developing a new commercial vehicle, among other things
The dividend cut will prove most costly for John K. Hanson, Winnebago's founder and chairman.Based on his control of about 45% of Winnebago's 24.7 million shares, his annual dividend income would be cut to about $2.2 million from $4.4 million
For the year, Winnebago had a loss of $4.7 million, or 19 cents a share, following profit of $2.7 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier.Sales rose 2% to $437.5 million from $430.3 million

The last time that traders experienced a trough was during 1985-86, when Beijing imposed tough measures to curb imports and conserve foreign exchange.The current trough is expected to be much deeper, because Beijing has cut off domestic funds from factories for the first time to slow inflation
Import growth from the year-earlier months slowed to 16% in July and 7.1% in August, compared with an average growth rate of 26% in the first half.In the first eight months of 1989, imports grew 21%, to $38.32 billion, down slightly from a growth rate of 23% a year earlier
The picture for China's exports is just as bleak, mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze.Exports in the first eight months grew only 9%, to $31.48 billion, compared with a growth rate of 25% a year earlier, according to Chinese customs figures
The threat to China's balance of payments is further aggravated by the plunge in its foreign-exchange reserves, excluding gold holdings.The reserves dropped for the first time in recent years, to $14 billion in June from $19 billion in April
The trend has prompted Beijing to intensify efforts to curb imports.In recent weeks, China's leaders have recentralized trading in wool and scores of chemical products and commodities

Another reason for the intensity of the trade problems is that Beijing has extended the current clampdown on imports beyond the usual target of consumer products to include steel, chemical fertilizers and plastics.These have been among the country's leading imports, particularly last year when there were shortages that led many traders to buy heavily and pay dearly
But the shortages also spawned rampant speculation and spiraling prices.To stem speculation, Beijing imposed ceiling prices that went into effect earlier this year

To judge from novels that mirror the contemporary scene, we're back in the age of anxiety.Where '60s dropouts professed to scorn middle-class life and ambitious yuppies hoped to leave it far behind as they scaled the upper reaches of success, it now seems that so many people feel they're slipping between the cracks, that middle-class life is viewed with nostalgia or outright longing

Nora's decision is between emotional excitement and emotional security, with no firm economic base anywhere.The characters confront a world in which it seems increasingly difficult to find a "middle way" between the extremes of success and failure, wealth and poverty
In making Malcolm and Nora such wonderfully representative specimens of their class and generation, Ms. Zeidner has somewhat neglected the task of making them distinctively individual characters.The humor of the story owes much to the fact that no hearts (even the characters' own) are likely to bleed for the plight of health-food eaters
In any case, the foundering middle classes aren't the only ones in trouble -- or whose troubles provide material for fiction. "Rascal Money" (Contemporary Books, 412 pages, $17.95), a novel by consultant and business analyst Joseph R. Garber, tells the story of an innovative, well-run, widely respected computer manufacturing company called PegaSys as it faces a hostile takeover attempt by AIW, a much smaller corporation that is so incompetently managed as to constitute a standing joke in the business world
And like a spy or mystery story, this novel has strong elements of allegory, as the good and evil forces battle it out.Mr. Garber depicts these moral qualities with the broad brush strokes of a satire that occasionally descends to the realm of cliched caricatures
Mr. Garber depicts these moral qualities with the broad brush strokes of a satire that occasionally descends to the realm of cliched caricatures.Standard-issue portraits of flaky Californians, snobbish homosexuals and Neanderthal union leaders undermine the force of the author's perceptions
Yet the heavy-handedness of the satire also can be effective in a book like this: If the head of AIW were not portrayed as an utterly contemptible, malicious dolt, we would not much care whether his schemes were defeated, and would not be so diverted in the process
High-definition television promises to be the TV of tomorrow, so it is a natural multibillion-dollar market.Although major U.S. manufacturers have all but ceded the main segment of that future business to Japan, not everyone here is ready to give up
A handful of small U.S. companies are struggling to develop the technology to build the screens for the thin, high-quality televisions that are expected to hang on living room walls by the end of the 1990s.With only small help from the government, these start-up concerns are trying to compete with the Goliaths of the Japanese consumer electronics industry, which enjoy considerable backing from the Japanese government
Planar Systems Inc. of Beaverton, Ore., the largest of these firms, with $20 million in annual revenue, has similar plans.It already has had success in electroluminescence, another promising technology adaptable for high-definition television
The new technologies are intended to retire the cathode-ray tube, which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set.Replacing the cathode-ray tube with a large, thin screen is the key to the creation of a high-definition television, or HDTV, which is expected to become a $30 billion business world-wide within a decade

They also want U.S. trade policy to reflect the Pentagon and Commerce department's concern over their future.They all are strongly opposed to a petition from several Japanese TV manufacturers, including Matsushita, Hitachi, and Toshiba, to exempt portable color TVs with liquid-crystal displays from anti-dumping duties that the U.S. imposes on the larger Japanese color TVs
And they want the U.S. to help them sell overseas.Planar President James Hurd says he has to pay tariffs as high as 15% to sell his display panels in Japan and South Korea, while panels from those countries enter the U.S. duty-free
This isn't a technology issue, but an attitude issue.We just haven't learned what it takes to compete

Comair Holdings Inc. said in Cincinnati that it bought Airline Aviation Academy, a pilot training school based at Sanford Regional Airport near Orlando, Fla.Comair said it paid cash but declined to disclose the price
Airline Aviation, which has annual revenue of $5 million to $6 million, has great growth potential because of the large number of U.S. pilots nearing retirement age, Comair said.The unit will be renamed Comair Aviation Academy and will continue to be headed by Scott Williams, a son of its founder, Comair said
the stock is worth somewhere between $135 and $150 a share.That's based on a multiple of anywhere between 8.5 to 10 times UAL earnings
Airline stocks typically sell at a discount of about one-third to the stock market's price-earnings ratio.That's because airline earnings, like those of auto makers, have been subject to the cyclical ups-and-downs of the economy
that the UAL pilots and management can put together a bid "in the $225 area," but that it could take three to four months to close.At that level, and given the uncertainty, he believes UAL stock should trade closer to 
that UAL's board, having accepted a bid of $300 a share, might hold out for a new bid much closer to the original level -- even if it means that the management goes back to running the company for a while and lets things return to normal.By that logic, the closing of a deal could be much further away than three to four months
The pilots have a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their annual compensation by $200 million, and to commit $200 million from their retirement funds.On Friday, they also persuaded the UAL flight attendants to join them
Banks want to see someone putting up real cash at risk, that is, subordinate to the bank debt in any deal.That way someone else has an even stronger motivation to make sure the deal is going to work, because they would be losing their money before the banks lost theirs
One obstacle to the pilots' finding such a huge amount of cash is their insistence on majority ownership.Investors such as Marvin Davis of Los Angeles who have sought airline ownership this year have insisted they, not the pilots, must have control
One way out of that dilemma could be a partial recapitalization in which the pilots would wind up sharing the value of their concessions with public shareholders.The pilots could borrow against the value of their concessions, using the proceeds to buy back stock from the public and give themselves the majority control they have been seeking
But it isn't clear that banks would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to shareholders.The lack of any new cash probably would still leave the banks dissatisfied
The lack of any new cash probably would still leave the banks dissatisfied.In advising the UAL board on the various bids for the airline, starting with one for $240 a share from Mr. Davis, the investment bank of First Boston came up with a wide range of potential values for the company, depending on appraisal methods and assumptions
Using the the NWA takeover as a benchmark, First Boston on Sept. 14 estimated that UAL was worth $250 to $344 a share based on UAL's results for the 12 months ending last June 30, but only $235 to $266 based on a management estimate of results for 1989.First Boston's estimates had been higher before management supplied a 1989 projection
Unfortunately, all those estimates came before airline industry fundamentals deteriorated during the past month.American Airlines parent AMR and USAir Group, both subject to takeover efforts themselves, have each warned of declining results
Some analysts don't expect a quick revival of any takeover by the pilots.The deal has so many moving parts
The deal has so many moving parts.I don't see anybody who's sophisticated getting his name associated with this mess until the moving parts stop moving
In the meantime, the arbs are bleeding.Wall Street traders and analysts estimate that takeover stock traders own UAL stock and options equal to as many as 6.5 million shares, or about 30% of the total outstanding

Convex makes supercomputers that sell for up to $2 million and has an installed base of more than 550 systems and 340 customers world-wide.During the third quarter, it said, it won several significant contracts, including a five-year contract with the National Institutes of Health valued at an estimated $8 million
Earlier this month, Convex made a bid to outflank other supercomputer competitors like Digital Equipment Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. by adopting an open set of standards and introducing new hardware and software to link different systems.The new products allow customers to add Convex machines to established systems made by other manufacturers

Interpublic approached Saatchi in August about buying its Campbell-Mithun-Esty unit, but was turned down by Chairman Maurice Saatchi.More recently, Interpublic inquired about one of Saatchi's smaller communications companies but again was rebuffed
More recently, Interpublic inquired about one of Saatchi's smaller communications companies -- identified as the Rowland public relations firm by several industry executives -- but again was rebuffed, they said.Interpublic's chairman and chief executive officer, Philip Geier Jr., made the pitches in visits to Mr. Saatchi in London, the executives said
that Saatchi has received several inquiries from companies interested in acquiring its Campbell-Mithun and Rowland units.We have no intention of selling either business
The offers come as Saatchi is struggling through the most troubled period in its 19-year history.Takeover speculation has been rife, its consulting business is on the block, and its largest shareholder, Southeastern Asset Management, has said it's been approached by third parties regarding a possible restructuring
Takeover speculation has been rife, its consulting business is on the block, and its largest shareholder, Southeastern Asset Management, has said it's been approached by third parties regarding a possible restructuring.Analysts have continually lowered their earnings estimates for the company, and their outlook, at least for the short term, is bleak
In the midst of the current turmoil, Saatchi is attempting to shore up its ad businesses.It named a new chief executive officer, former IMS International head Robert Louis-Dreyfus
It named a new chief executive officer, former IMS International head Robert Louis-Dreyfus.It rebuffed an offer by Carl Spielvogel, head of Saatchi's Backer Spielvogel Bates unit, to lead a management buy-out of all or part of Saatchi
But Saatchi's troubles have only whipped up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses.While Saatchi's major agency networks -- Backer Spielvogel and Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising -- would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts, its smaller businesses are quite attractive
Campbell-Mithun-Esty, for example, has had big problems at its New York office, but offers strong offices in other areas of the country, including Minneapolis and Chicago.That would would make it appealing to a network such as Interpublic that already has a healthy New York presence
That would would make it appealing to a network such as Interpublic that already has a healthy New York presence. (While there would be some client conflicts, they wouldn't be nearly as onerous as with Saatchi's other agencies
Campbell-Mithun also would be a sizable addition to an agency network: It has billings of about $850 million and blue-chip clients including General Mills, Jeep/Eagle and Dow Brands
Rowland, meanwhile, has expanded aggressively, and now ranks as the fifth-largest U.S. public relations firm, according to O'Dwyer's Directory of Public Relations Firms.It would be attractive to an agency such as Interpublic, one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own

the company may ultimately sell some of the smaller units.he might sell "a marginal agency or office
In addition to Backer Spielvogel Bates, a Saatchi unit that has handled the account since 1970, the other agencies include Lowe Marschalk, a unit of the Lowe Group; Grey Advertising; and WPP Group's Scali, McCabe, Sloves agency.All agencies are New York-based
The memo attempts to remove the tourist board as far as possible from the agency.Among other things, the memo contends that Young & Rubicam gave false assurances that the investigation wouldn't uncover any information that would "embarrass the government of Jamaica or the Jamaica Tourist Board

Both of Dr. Baltimore's public faces have been on view the past few weeks while he was under consideration to succeed Joshua Lederberg as head of the prestigious Rockefeller research institution.It came to light that a substantial number of Rockefeller's faculty were upset over or even opposed to Dr. Baltimore's impending appointment
They were disturbed at what they regarded as Dr. Baltimore's confrontational attitude toward the Dingell committee, which held hearings on a dispute over the lab notebooks of a researcher who had co-authored a scientific paper with Dr. Baltimore.Readers of these columns ("The Science Police," May 15) will recall that Dr. Baltimore was merely the most well-known part of the Dingell committee's larger investigation, which touched MIT, Tufts, Duke, the National Institutes of Health and elsewhere

Scientists need to understand that while they tend to believe their work is primarly about establishing new knowledge or doing good, today it is also about power.In a media-linked world, scientists may earn wide praise and even Nobels for their work, but they also attract the attention of people who wish to gain control over the content, funding and goals of that work

Ducks.If the White House spots one, it intends to fire a veto at it

The effect of Nixon era non-duck ducks was an economy clogged up with regulations and distortions.All this was recognized and documented in the succeeding years by economists

Forecasts for the trade figures range widely, but few economists expect the data to show a very marked improvement from the #2 billion ($3.2 billion) deficit in the current account reported for August.The August deficit and the #2.2 billion gap registered in July are topped only by the #2.3 billion deficit of October 1988
At the same time, he remains fairly pessimistic about the outlook for imports, given continued high consumer and capital goods inflows.He reckons the current account deficit will narrow to only #1.8 billion in September
However, Mr. Dillow said he believes that a reduction in raw material stockbuilding by industry could lead to a sharp drop in imports.Combined with at least some rebound in exports after August's unexpected decline, the deficit could narrow to as little as #1.3 billion
Meanwhile, overall evidence on the economy remains fairly clouded.In his Mansion House speech, Mr. Lawson warned that a further slowdown can be expected as the impact of the last rise in interest rates earlier this month takes effect
In his Mansion House speech, Mr. Lawson warned that a further slowdown can be expected as the impact of the last rise in interest rates earlier this month takes effect.U.K. base rates are at their highest level in eight years

Trucking, shipping and air-freight companies have announced rate increases, scheduled for this fall or early next year, reflecting higher costs and tightened demand for freight transport.they expect freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in the next few years
Major shippers say they expect freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in the next few years.That's a big change from recent years when freight haulage was a bright spot for U.S. productivity, helping to restrain inflation and make U.S. industry more competitive abroad
Shippers surveyed recently by Ohio State University said they expect their freight-transport, storage and distribution costs to rise about 4% this year.Only 10% of the 250 shippers polled expected their freight-transport costs to decrease, compared with 30% who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in past years
Only 10% of the 250 shippers polled expected their freight-transport costs to decrease, compared with 30% who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in past years. "This is the first year since transportation deregulation in 1980 that we have had such a dramatic and broad-based upturn in perceived transportation rates
The deregulation of railroads and trucking companies that began in 1980 enabled shippers to bargain for transportation.Carriers could use their equipment more efficiently
Carriers could use their equipment more efficiently, leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill.Shippers cut about $35 billion from their annual, inter-city truck and rail costs, to about $150 billion, or about 6.4% of gross national product, down from 8% of GNP in 1981

Not everyone believes that the good times are over for shippers. "There's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck," said Gerard McCullough, lecturer in transportation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology

since President Bush disclosed them privately to seven Republican senators at a White House meeting last Monday.Mr. Bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this month's futile effort to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega

However, the disclosure of the guidelines is already being interpreted on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort to pressure Congress.It has reopened the bitter wrangling between the White House and Congress over who is responsible for the failure to oust Mr. Noriega

It's time to stop bickering and work together to develop a clear and appropriate policy to help the country in the future.I've invited the president to send his suggestions to the committee
In fact, yesterday the administration and Congress were still differing on what had been agreed to.One administration official said notification was required even if the U.S. "gets wind" of somebody else's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator's life
that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of U.S. intelligence and military operatives in Panama.it could make U.S. operatives reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble
the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation.Last week, Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster publicly called on Congress to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the U.S. more freedom to act in coups
Nevertheless, the administration's criticisms appeared to have made some headway with Sens.Boren and Cohen after their Oct. 12 meeting with the president.The three men agreed to rewrite the guidelines, without changing the basic assassination ban, to clear up any ambiguities that may have hampered U.S. encouragement of coups against anti-American leaders

It turned out to be lucky for us.If the whole market thinks what you're doing is crazy you don't have much competition
Mr. Andersson is anxious to strengthen Trelleborg's balance sheet.Characteristically, he didn't waste much time getting started
On Tuesday, Trelleborg's directors announced plans to spin off two big divisions -- minerals processing, and building and distribution -- as separately quoted companies on Stockholm's Stock Exchange.At current market prices, the twin public offerings to be completed next year would add an estimated 2.5 billion Swedish kronor ($386 million) to Trelleborg's coffers, analysts say
Trelleborg's internationally traded "Bfree" series stock plunged SKr29 ($4.48) to SKr205 ($31.65) in volatile trading Monday in Stockholm.Tuesday, the shares regained SKr20, closing at SKr225
that taking parts of the company public will help erase the "conglomerate stigma" that has held down Trelleborg's share price.Trelleborg plans to remain the dominant shareholder with stakes of slightly less than 50% of both units
The spinoff should solve a problem for the parent.A family foundation set up by late founder Henry Dunker controls 59% of Trelleborg's voting shares outstanding.But the foundation bylaws require the entire Trelleborg stake to be sold in the open market if control drops below 50%
That possibility had crept closer as repeated new share offerings to finance Trelleborg's rapid growth steadily diluted the foundation's holding.That growth is the result of Mr. Andersson's shopping spree, during which he has bought and sold more than 100 companies during the past five years
Most of the new additions were barely profitable, if not outright loss makers.Applying prowess gained during earlier stints at appliance maker AB Electrolux, Mr. Andersson and a handful of loyal lieutenants aggressively stripped away dead wood -- and got quick results
The treatment turned Trelleborg into one of Scandinavia's biggest and fastest-growing industrial concerns.Between 1985 and 1988, sales multipled more than 10 times and pretax profit surged almost twelvefold
Last month, in his boldest move yet, Mr. Andersson and Trelleborg joined forces with Canada's Noranda Inc. in a joint $2 billion hostile takeover of another big Canadian mining concern, Falconbridge Ltd.that the conquest of Falconbridge could vault Trelleborg from a regional Scandinavian success story to a world-class mining concern
But Trelleborg still must clear some tough hurdles.that the company's mining division "will be busy for a while digesting its recent expansion
Mining is likely to remain Trelleborg's main business.Analysts say its chances of success will likely hinge on how well Trelleborg manages to cooperate with Noranda in the Falconbridge venture
Noranda and Trelleborg each came close to winning Falconbridge alone before the successful joint bid.Some analysts say Noranda would prefer to break up Falconbridge, and that the Swedes -- relatively inexperienced in international mining operations -- could have problems holding their own with a much bigger partner like Noranda operating on its home turf
that Trelleborg and Noranda haven't discussed a Falconbridge break-up.Falconbridge will continue operating in its current form

He surveys the prospective investors gathered in the board room of the Philippine government's Asset Privatization Trust for the sale of a 36% interest in the country's largest paper mill.The agency expects the bids to be equivalent of more than $80 million

In October 1987, President Corazon Aquino vowed that her government would "get out of business" by selling all or part of the state's holdings in the many companies taken over by the government during the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos.Two years later, Mrs. Aquino's promise remains largely unfulfilled
October is a critical month for the privatization program.Manila is offering several major assets for the first time and is trying to conclude sales already arranged
In addition, the government is scheduled to unveil plans for privatizing Philippine Airlines, the national carrier, an effort that lawyer and business columnist Rodolfo Romero calls "the bellwether of privatization." All told, there are assets on the line valued at up to $1.03 billion
The privatization program is designed to rid the government of hundreds of assets and to raise critically needed funds.Much of the money from the sales is earmarked for a multibillion-dollar agrarian-reform program
But efforts have been thwarted by official indifference, bureaucratic resistance, a legal system that operates at a snail's pace, political opposition and government misjudgments.Most recently, a lack of buyers has been added to the list
Rather than gathering momentum, the program is in danger of slowing even more as the government tackles several big assets.The axiom appears to be that the more valuable the asset, the harder the privatization process
that the more valuable the asset, the harder the privatization process. "You just don't see a whole lot happening
To be sure, the program hasn't completely stalled.The Asset Privatization Trust, the agency chiefly responsible for selling government-held properties, has recorded sales of more than $500 million since it began functioning in December 1986

Guillermo Ortiz's Sept. 15 Americas column, "Mexico's Been Bitten by the Privatization Bug," is a refreshingly clear statement of his government's commitment to privatization, and must be welcomed as such by all Americans who wish his country well.The Mexico-United States Institute is glad to see such a high official as Mexico's undersecretary of finance view his country's reforms "in the context of a larger, world-wide process" of profound change toward free-market economics, especially in the statist countries

In East Germany, where humor has long been the only way to express political criticism, they're not laughing about their new leader Egon Krenz.Mr. Krenz is such a contradictory figure that nobody has even come up with any good jokes about him
You have to have clear feelings about someone before you can make jokes.With Krenz, we just don't know what to expect
With Krenz, we just don't know what to expect." Mr. Krenz doesn't seem to be the knee-jerk hardliner many initially thought he was when the 52-year-old Politburo member was selected last week to succeed Erich Honecker
According to East Germany's ADN news agency, Mr. Krenz spoke to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged East Germany could learn from Moscow's glasnost policies.Already last week, Mr. Krenz started overhauling East Germany's heavily censored and notoriously boring news media
Already last week, Mr. Krenz started overhauling East Germany's heavily censored and notoriously boring news media.On Thursday, a day after he took office, East German television broke into regular programming to launch a talk show in which viewers call in questions for a panel of officials to answer
It was quite a shock.For the first time in my life, I wasn't sure whether I was listening to our news or West German television
And that's a problem.Mr. Krenz is not only closely identified with his mentor, Mr. Honecker, but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising China for sending tanks against student demonstrators
Mr. Krenz is not only closely identified with his mentor, Mr. Honecker, but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising China for sending tanks against student demonstrators. "I hope he grows with the job," says Rainer Eppelmann, a Protestant pastor in East Berlin
I hope he grows with the job.The most important thing is that he have a chance
there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades.Unlike Mr. Honecker Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions
He was later shown on television, fielding questions.At one point, he asked a worker whether he thought East Germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies
At one point, he asked a worker whether he thought East Germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies.The worker's tart reply: "It's more than just travel
It's more than just travel.People have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society
People have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society." The exchange was all the more remarkable in that authorities released television footage to Western news agencies
This same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting U.S. congressmen this spring.Rather than trying to "lecture us," says one congressional aide who attended the two-hour meeting, Mr. Krenz "wanted to listen
Rather than trying to "lecture us Mr. Krenz "wanted to listen.he was particularly impressed by Mr. Krenz's ready admission that East Germany needed to change
But there's another side to Mr. Krenz.Born in a Baltic town in an area which is now part of Poland, he has dedicated his life to the party apparatus
Born in a Baltic town in an area which is now part of Poland, he has dedicated his life to the party apparatus.He moved quickly through the ranks with the help of his patron, Mr. Honecker, and emerged as the heir apparent
he's a true reformer.Even if he is he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within the Communist Party's ruling Politburo
Against this background, the new East German leader must move quickly to shore up his government's standing.The sudden growth of the opposition movement, together with the steady outflow of citizens escaping through Poland and Hungary, has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis since an anti-Soviet workers' uprising in 1953
But if he's sharp and quick, he has a chance.that Mr. Krenz has several things going for him

But the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fusing of hydrogen atoms.New experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions
The meeting offered stark evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research.Of the 1,300 chemists registered for the society's weeklong meeting, fewer than 200 sat through the day and a half of cold fusion presentations at week's end
Of the 1,300 chemists registered for the society's weeklong meeting, fewer than 200 sat through the day and a half of cold fusion presentations at week's end.This was in contrast with the society's meeting last May, at the height of the controversy, when more than 1,500 scientists, along with scores of reporters and TV crews, crowded into a Los Angeles hotel ballroom for a tumultuous special night session on the subject
But some members of an ad hoc expert committee set up by the Department of Energy to evaluate the cold fusion research were in the audience.The committee is to recommend at the end of the month whether DOE should support cold fusion research
Most of the two dozen scientists taking the podium reported results with new, more sophisticated variations of the seemingly simple electrolysis-of-water experiments described last March by Messrs.Fleischmann and Pons.The experiments involve encircling a thin rod of palladium metal with a wire of platinum and plunging the two electrodes into "heavy" water in which the hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known as deuterium
The experiments involve encircling a thin rod of palladium metal with a wire of platinum and plunging the two electrodes into "heavy" water in which the hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known as deuterium.When an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum electrodes, the heavy water did begin to break up, or dissociate
When an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum electrodes, the heavy water did begin to break up, or dissociate.Ordinarily the electrolysis, or breakup, of the water would consume almost all of the electrical energy
their experiments also produced large amounts of heat.The heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in
The heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in.Because they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation, they asserted that the "excess" heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms inside the palladium rod
As of last weekend, a dozen labs also have reported measuring "excess" heat from similar electrolytic experiments, although amounts of such heat vary widely.One of the seven reports presented here of excess heat production was given by Richard A. Oriani, professor of chemical engineering at the University of Minnesota
But he then borrowed a palladium rod from chemists at Texas A&M who said they were getting excess heat. "The results were fascinating," he said
The results were fascinating," he said.On the fourth "run" with the borrowed rod, the experiment began producing excess heat

The experiment was stopped briefly to change an instrument.When it was restarted, heat output "really took off
his experiment was "very erratic." It would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times, it would begin producing excess heat for as long as 10 or 11 hours before quieting down
It would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times, it would begin producing excess heat for as long as 10 or 11 hours before quieting down.The excess heat was 15% to 20% more than the energy involved in the electrolysis of water
the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments' quiescent times, as some scientists have suggested. "There is a reality to the excess energy
they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time.The bursts often occur after they "perturbed" the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied, or switching the current off and on
The bursts often occur after they "perturbed" the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied, or switching the current off and on.that some "anomalous" chemical reactions might be producing the heat

Typically, the input energy ranges from a third of a watt to one watt and the excess energy is measured in tenths of a watt.One exception is a continuing experiment at Stanford University where as much as 10 watts of energy are being put into the electrolytic cells
One exception is a continuing experiment at Stanford University where as much as 10 watts of energy are being put into the electrolytic cells.A cell filled with heavy water is producing 1.0 to 1.5 watts more heat than an identical electrolytic cell filled with ordinary water next to it
Mr. Bockris previously reported getting bursts of excess heat and of detecting increasing amounts of tritium forming in the heavy water.he's gotten evidence that there is a "weak correlation" between the time the heat bursts occur and the production of tritium
he's gotten evidence that there is a "weak correlation" between the time the heat bursts occur and the production of tritium.There isn't any way to continuously measure the amount of tritium in the heavy water
Increasingly careful attempts to measure neutrons, which would be strong evidence of fusion reactions, continue to be negative.Messrs.Fleischmann and Pons initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable
Fleischmann and Pons initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable.Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., reported they went so far as to take a "cold fusion" experiment and three neutron detectors into a tunnel under 300 feet of granite to shield the detectors from cosmic rays
Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., reported they went so far as to take a "cold fusion" experiment and three neutron detectors into a tunnel under 300 feet of granite to shield the detectors from cosmic rays.A number of times they detected neutrons in one, sometimes two, of the three detectors, but only once during 411 hours of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in all three detectors -- and they think that was a spurious event
researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment last April but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it.In subsequent experiments, one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time
In subsequent experiments, one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time.They concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment

Hunt's attempt to squeeze the silver market 10 years ago is still indirectly to blame for today's market depression.While some 100 million ounces of silver once held by Mr. Hunt and Middle Eastern associates aren't hanging over the market anymore, the price surge of 1979-80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use
Meanwhile, the photographic industry continues to look for substitutes.Japanese and U.S. photographic firms are beginning to produce electronic cameras and X-rays that don't require silver

Most analysts had expected the government to report a 4% decline.Feedlots fatten young cattle for slaughter, so a decline signals a tightening supply of beef
The government reported that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter dropped 5% compared with the year-earlier quarter.Many industry analysts had been projecting a 3% decline in placements for the quarter
The number of cattle moving onto feedlots in the recent quarter was also lower because fattening cattle is less profitable.A shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for feedlot operators to buy
Friday's 44-cent-a-barrel price drop to $19.98 in the expiring November contract for West Texas Intermediate crude may well set the tone for trading this week in petroleum futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Most traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical factors associated with the contract's going off the board

As hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another, franchisers are struggling desperately for market share, slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions.The fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many, threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees
The chains "used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow, but in the last year or so, discounting has become a 12-month thing.Though Charisma's sales are up slightly this year, Mr. Harty says profits will be flat or lower
But early this year, PepsiCo Inc. 's Taco Bell unit and Wendy's International Inc. slashed prices and stepped up promotions.That brought a chain reaction in the industry

The prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees.that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties, or portion of sales, that they must pay franchisers
But once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program, the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end.courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing
In any case, many franchisees, in order to stay on good terms with franchisers, routinely go along with promotions.If you resisted on prices, maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise

Reggie Jackson, the retired baseball star, has found another use for them.Mr. Jackson is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for as much as $500 each
Dealers say the budding trade in Mr. Jackson's canceled checks is unusual. "I don't know of any living ballplayer that's ever done it
An initial batch of Mr. Jackson's checks was on sale at a baseball-card show held in San Francisco over Labor Day weekend.Mr. Jackson showed up at the affair to sign autographs for a fee as well
But these players were dead. "Maybe three years ago, there were a lot of {Ty} Cobbs in the hobby, and awhile back there were Babe Ruth checks
However, the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way. "Maybe I'm a little stuffy, but I wouldn't sell them," sniffs Bob Machon, owner of Papa's Sports Cards in Menlo Park, Calif
Maybe I'm a little stuffy, but I wouldn't sell them.Who knows how much they'll be worth 100 years from now
they're worth all that much now.the checks are worth $15 apiece
Why Mr. Jackson has made some of his checks available for sale isn't clear.He probably hasn't done it for the cash
I would say he's definitely not in need of money.He has good investments
Or at least he should. "I assume those accounts are closed," says Mr. Smalling, referring to the accounts of the canceled checks

The move by the nation's largest steelmaker follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies.Bethlehem Steel Corp., LTV Corp. and Armco Inc. all have plans to build additional lines for such coated corrosion-resistant steel
The surge in production raises questions about capacity outpacing demand.They note that most of the new plants will come on line in 1992, when the current import trade restraint program ends, which could result in more imports
There's too much capacity.there's anyone not building one
that transplanted Japanese car makers are boosting the levels of U.S.-made steel in their autos.That trend could increase demand for hot-dipped galvanized sheet
Indeed, USX said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach 12 million tons annually by 1992, compared with 10.2 million tons shipped in 1988.For the first eight months of 1989, analysts say shipments of hot-dipped galvanized steel increased about 8% from a year earlier, while overall steel shipments were up only 2.4%
Steelmakers have also been adding capacity of so-called electrogalvanized steel, which is another way to make coated corrosion-resistant steel.One of the advantages of the hot-dipped process is that it allows the steel to be covered with a thicker coat of zinc more quickly
ONCE YOU MAKE UP your mind about an investment, the rest is easy, right?You just call your broker and say "buy" or "sell
Dream on.There are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many ways to get burned if you don't know what you're doing
So here's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges.Two things to keep in mind
Two things to keep in mind: Not all exchanges accept every type of order
Market Order: This is probably the most widely used order -- and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers, since it imposes no price restrictions.With a market order, an investor tells a broker to buy or sell "at the market
With a market order, an investor tells a broker to buy or sell "at the market." It's like saying, "get me in now" or "get me out now
For example, if wheat is being offered at $4.065 and bid at $4.060, a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price.that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers
Limit orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment.Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it
Investors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it.Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock, but not for less than $55
Suppose an investor wants to sell a stock, but not for less than $55.A limit order to sell could be entered at that price
A limit order to sell could be entered at that price.One risk
Stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level.Once the price reaches that level, a stop order turns into a market order, and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get
Once the price reaches that level, a stop order turns into a market order, and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get.Stop orders are sometimes called "stop-loss" orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses
While stop orders sound similar to limit orders, there is a difference: Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above.In contrast, sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below
The crash in October 1987 and last Friday's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and won't do.An investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at $90 under a stock that was trading at $100 a share on the Friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at $75 when the stock opened at that price on Monday
Stop-limit orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order.Unlike stop orders -- which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit -- stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price
Unlike stop orders stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price.If it can't be made at that price, it doesn't get filled
However, unlike a buy-stop order, a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price, while a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it.As soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price
The fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades.It instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better
But if the investment can't be bought or sold immediately, the order is automatically canceled.Gregory Bessemer, who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed U.S. Trading Championship, says he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options
he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options. "I like to use them to feel out the market
I like to use them to feel out the market.If they don't fill it immediately, then I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price
This is another timing order.It is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment, if they think they can get a better price by waiting
It is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment, if they think they can get a better price by waiting.Not-held orders, which are also known as "disregard the tape" orders, are always done at the customer's risk
This is really two orders in one, generally for the same security or commodity, instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order.In a fast-moving market, it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security
This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time. "On the close" can be added to many types of orders
For example, "market-on-close orders" must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange. "Stop-close-only orders" are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading
Stop-close-only orders" are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading. "Day orders" expire at the end of the day on which they are entered, "good-till-canceled orders" have no expiration date
Day orders" expire at the end of the day on which they are entered, "good-till-canceled orders" have no expiration date.Most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise
On Oct. 19, 1987, some investors learned the consequences of entering "good-til-canceled limit orders" and then forgetting about them.They found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel
They found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel.It is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed
It is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed.Investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are, usually, stuck with the consequences
Beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund.For any given move in the overall market, it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall
Beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret.The beta of the broad market, typically defined as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, is always 1.0
Cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas.Go with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market
Remember, though, that beta also has important limitations. "Beta is only part of the risk in a stock
Beta is only part of the risk in a stock.There is risk that is not associated with market moves, and the beta doesn't tell you the magnitude of that
In particular, beta doesn't measure the company- and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock.That "business" risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks
Our fear was people would look just at the beta {of a gold fund} and say here is an investment with very low risk.In reality it's very volatile, but the movements are not because of market movements
First, a pop quiz.When you think of the words "risk" and "investment," what's the specific peril that comes to mind
Pencils down.If you're like most people, you said it's a holding that goes completely sour -- maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding
This is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like babies every night, lulled by visions of your money sitting risk-free in six-month CDs.Risk wears many disguises, and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other, less obvious kinds
Stocks are much riskier than Treasury bills, for example, because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider.That is usually measured by the standard deviation, or divergence, of annual results from the average return over time
They estimate the return a person's current portfolio is likely to generate over time, along with a standard deviation that suggests how much the return will vary year by year.They try to figure out the long-term results the person needs to meet major goals
Note that the younger couple's portfolio has a higher expected annual return, 10.1% vs. 8.8%.That largely reflects the heavy stockholdings
Then take the expected return and subtract one standard deviation.In two of three years, the actual result should fall within that range if all the assumptions were accurate
Then add and subtract two standard deviations to get a wider range.There's a 95% probability any year's result will fall in the range
When it comes to investing, trying to weigh risk and reward can seem like throwing darts blindfolded: Investors don't know the actual returns that securities will deliver, or the ups and downs that will occur along the way
A letter from Senator John Kerry chides us today for implying that he had "flip-flopped" on Manuel Noriega.He correctly says he has been down on Noriega for some time, hence his criticism of administration mishandling of the attempted coup
Our October 12 editorial should have been more precise.It meant to convey our hope that the Senator and other members of the congressional left are broadening their dislike of Noriega to include other notorious Central American drug runners

THROUGHOUT THE 1980s, investors have been looking for creative alternatives to traditional modes of financial planning.Capital has been democratized, and people want in
Now a startling new approach is available to building your financial portfolio without undue risk, without extensive planning and without hurting your life style one bit! This is particularly good news for those who hate risk, who are incapable of doing extensive amounts of planning and who refuse to see their life styles hurt in any way

My revolutionary system is also useful for those who have tried customary forms of growing their currency cushion.Like all Americans seeking chronic prosperity, I do find it necessary to plunge certain funds into conservative monetary tools, if only to assuage my father-in-law, who believes in such things
So throughout the decade I have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and CDs, and tinkered with stocks, bonds and mutual funds, as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real-estate market.Return on this fine portfolio has been modest when it has not been negative
Figure 1 demonstrates the performance of those businesses I've invested in during this prosperous decade.Oil-related properties suffered a huge decline until I divested myself of all such stocks in 1985, at which point the industry, while not lighting up any Christmas trees, began a slow recovery
Likewise, mutual funds remained relatively flat until I made what was, for me, a serious investment.By 1987, these properties were in a tailspin, causing my broker at Pru-Bache to remark that she'd "never seen anything like it
By 1987, these properties were in a tailspin, causing my broker at Pru-Bache to remark that she'd "never seen anything like it." Concerned for her state of mind, I dropped them -- and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health
Concerned for her state of mind, I dropped them -- and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health.Perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan New York real-estate market, which was booming until I entered it in late 1988, at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years
We've all got money to spend, some of it clearly disposable since we keep disposing of it.Bank it
but here in Figure 2 is where I've chosen to build for the future: personal space; automotive pursuits; children's toys; gardening equipment, bulbs and shrubs; and finally, entertainment, perhaps the best investment of all.All have paid off for me in double-digit annual growth and continue to provide significant potential
Continued investment in my 1984 subcompact has been part of my strategy (Figure 5), with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60% of the car's original value.According to my calculations, these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than $22,000 on the open market
I have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers.My initial stake in this blooming enterprise has grown tenfold, according to my conservative calculations
With this personal strategy firmly in place, I look forward to years of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage.My kids' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending, although I'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it
But with every step I take, I'm building wealth.You can, too, if you, like me, refuse to bite the bullet
So go out there and eat that debt.You're right there in the mainstream of American business, building value on the back of insupportable expenditures

He tried management consulting, traded in turquoise for a while, and even managed professional wrestlers.Now he has settled into a career that fits the bill -- financial planning
But in this case the needle has a very sharp point.Though it's probably safe to assume that the majority of financial planners are honest and even reasonably competent, the fact remains that, as one wag puts it, "anybody who can fog a mirror" can call himself a financial planner
but in effect they operate in the dark.There is no effective regulation of planners, no accepted standard for admission into their ranks no way to assess their performance, no way even to know how many of them there are
There is no effective regulation of planners, no accepted standard for admission into their ranks no way to assess their performance, no way even to know how many of them there are.All anyone need do is hang up a shingle and start planning
So it should come as no shock that the profession, if that's what it is, has attracted a lot of people whose principal talents seem to be frittering away or flat-out stealing their clients' money.Alarmed, state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways to certify and regulate planners

An admittedly limited survey by NASAA found that between 1986 and 1988 "fraud and abuse" by financial planners cost 22,000 investors $400 million.The rogues' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons, a compulsive gambler or two, various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy, and one man who scammed his wife's grandmother
The rogues' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons, a compulsive gambler or two, various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy, and one man who scammed his wife's grandmother.What's more, the losses they and the others caused "are just what we are stumbling over
So do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners.Nobody can estimate the toll, but John Gargan, a Tampa, Fla., planner and head of one trade group, the International Association of Registered Financial Planners, thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is "humongous," far greater than that from crookery
the danger to investors from incompetence is "humongous," far greater than that from crookery.His group, like others, wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners
the best planner might be no planner at all.For most investors "the benefits just aren't worth the risks
but as a consumer advocate she feels impelled to take it.She says her group used to give tips on selecting planners -- check educational and experience credentials, consult regulators and Better Business Bureaus -- but found that even some people who took these steps "were still getting ripped off
The bad news, however, hasn't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning.The Tax Reform Act of 1986, which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by planners, and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand, and many planners had to make an unplanned exit from the business
and the pool of capital they influence is enormous.A survey of 54,000 of them conducted by the IAFP in April showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of $154 billion of their clients' money in the previous 12 months
The sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult, if not impossible, to regulate.Even the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as "investment advisers have been enough to swamp the agency's capacity
Even the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as "investment advisers have been enough to swamp the agency's capacity.The SEC has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers -- about the same as in 1980 -- even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15,000 over the past decade

So the SEC has proposed to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry-funded, self-regulatory organization patterned on the National Association of Securities Dealers.Such an organization could, among other things, set minimum standards for competence, ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules
The proposal has set off a lively debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with.Mr. Schwartz, the puckish planner from Englewood, Colo., says that allowing the business to police itself would be "like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank
Mr. Schwartz, the puckish planner from Englewood, Colo., says that allowing the business to police itself would be "like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank." Mr. Gargan, the Tampa planner who heads one trade group, favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the SEC to hire more staff
Mr.Gargan's views are not greeted with wild enthusiasm over at the IAFP, the major industry organization.When the IAFP recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners, Mr. Gargan's group was excluded
When the IAFP recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners, Mr. Gargan's group was excluded.That may be because Mr. Gargan, smarting at what he considered slurs on his membership standards made by the rival group, enrolled his dog, Beauregard, as a member of the IAFP
The states have their own ideas about regulation and certification.NASAA, the organization of state securities regulators, is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted in eight states
NASAA, the organization of state securities regulators, is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted in eight states.It requires financial planners to register with states, pass competency tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest

In 1986 the New York attorney general's office got an order from a state court in Albany shutting down First Meridian Corp., an Albany financial-planning firm that had invested $55 million on behalf of nearly 1,000 investors.In its notice of action, the attorney general said the company had promised to put clients into "balanced" investment portfolios; instead, the attorney general alleged, the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high-risk investments in paintings, coins and Florida condos

Investors were further assured that only those with a minimun net worth would be accepted.In practice if an investor had access to cash "the chances of being turned down by First Meridian were about as probable as being rejected by the Book-of-the-Month Club
And First Meridian's president, Roger V. Sala, portrayed himself as a "financial expert" when his qualifications largely consisted of a high-school diploma, work as a real-estate and insurance salesman, and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth.First Meridian and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing, according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general

Civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common.Two such actions could be particularly embarrassing to the industry
Two such actions could be particularly embarrassing to the industry: both name J. Chandler Peterson, an Atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the IAFP, as defendant
Mr. Peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of 1988 or the money returned.Mr. Peterson took the plaintiffs' and other investors' money to a meeting of the bank's directors
Wearing a business suit and western-style hat and boots, he opened up his briefcase and dumped $1 million in cash on a table in front of the directors.he wanted to show the color of his money
and the sale never came off.According to the suit, Mr. Peterson has yet to return the plaintiffs' investment

They want it back.Mr. Peterson declines to comment on specific allegations in the two suits
he is considering a defamation suit against the plaintiffs.The suit is almost in the nature of a vendetta by a handful of disgruntled people
Rearding the suit over the bank bid, Mr. Peterson says it is filled with "inflammatory language and half truths." He declines to go into specifics
the suits against him are less a measure of his work than they are a "sign of the times" in which people generally are more prone to sue.anybody in the industry who hasn't experienced litigation
he doesn't consider himself a financial planner anymore.He now calls himself an "investment banker
In many scams or alleged scams involving planners, it's plain that only a modicum of common sense on the part of the investors would have kept them out of harm's way.Using it, wouldn't a proessional hesitate to pay tens of thousands of dollars just for a chance to invest witha planner

In fact, sophisticated big-bucks boiler-room scams are known generically among law-enforcement types as "Newport Beach" operations.That contrasts with the penny-ante sales of things such as pen-and-pencil sets and office supplies that are known as "Hollywood" scams
Newport Beach telemarketers concentrate on precious metals and oil-leasing deals that typically cost thousands of dollars a shot.The investors range from elderly widows to affluent professionals
In one ingenious recent example of a Newport Beach boiler room, prospective investors in Capital Trust Inc. were allegedly told that their investment in precious metals was insured against losses "caused by employees due to dishonesty, destruction or disappearance," according to an indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles last month.Thus falsely reassured, investors sent $11.4 million to the Newport Beach company, most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses

The latest wave of marketing is instructive.Several outfits are advertising "college planner" tables and charts that tell you how much you need to put aside regularly
Several outfits -- including the Financial Programs, Franklin, and T. Rowe Price mutual-fund groups and the Edward D. Jones brokerage house -- are advertising "college planner" tables and charts that tell you how much you need to put aside regularly.The calculations generally rely on an after-tax rate of return of 8% annually -- a rate historically obtainable by the individual in only one place, the stock market

Plugging a cheaper college into the formulas still doesn't generate an installment most people can live with.Using a recent average private-school cost of about $12,500 a year, T. Rowe Price's planner prescribes $450 monthly if the plan begins when the child is six
Using a recent average private-school cost of about $12,500 a year, T. Rowe Price's planner prescribes $450 monthly if the plan begins when the child is six.Since the formula assumes an 8% before-tax return in a mutual fund, there would also be $16,500 in taxes to pay over the 12 years

In their anxiety, however, parents and other student benefactors are flocking to new schemes.They have laid out about $1 billion for so-called baccalaureate zero-coupon municipal bonds
And they have bought about $500 million in prepaid-tuition plans, offered in Michigan, Florida and Wyoming.The prepaid plans take payment today -- usually at current tuitions or at a slight discount -- for a promise that tuition will be covered tomorrow
The baccalaureate bonds seem to be tailor-made for college savers.Like other zeros, they pay all their interest at maturity, meaning that buyers can time things so that their bonds pay off just when Junior graduates from high school
Their compounding effect is also alluring.In June, Virginia sold bonds for $268.98 that will pay $1,000 in 2009
But Richard Anderson, head of the Forum for College Financing Alternatives, at Columbia University, a research group partly financed by the federal government, says zeros are particularly ill-suited.Their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up
Their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up.That won't matter if they are held to maturity, but if, for any reason, the parents need to sell them before then, there could be a severe loss of principal

Once such abuses become so pervasive, the IRS builds another factor into its secret computer formula for selecting returns for audit and doesn't need special projects for them.San Franciscans have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula, not because IRS agents envy their life styles

The independent-contractor project, which began in 1988, involves about 350 IRS agents.In the fiscal nine months ended June 30 they examined about 13,000 employers, assessed more than $67 million in delinquent employment taxes, and reclassified about 56,000 workers as employees instead of self-employed contractors

Over the past decade or two the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products, variations on products, and variations on the variations.Besides term life and whole life (the old standbys), we now have universal life, universal variable life, flexible adjustable universal life, policies with persistency bonuses, policies festooned with exotic riders, living benefit policies, and on and on
Besides term life and whole life (the old standbys), we now have universal life, universal variable life, flexible adjustable universal life, policies with persistency bonuses, policies festooned with exotic riders, living benefit policies, and on and on.What to do
First, generalize.Shorn of all their riders, special provisions, and other bells and whistles, insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories: so-called pure insurance, which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death, and permanent insurance, which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive
If all you want is death-benefit coverage, pure insurance -- a term policy -- gives you maximum bang for your buck, within limits.It's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age
But "term" means just that; the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires
It may also stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal; if you flunk you may not be able to buy it
if you flunk you may not be able to buy it.Even if you're healthy and can renew, your premium will go up sharply because you're that much older
There are all sorts of variations on term insurance: policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt, term riders tacked on to permanent insurance, and many others.One variation that appealed to me at first was the "Money Smart Term Life" policy offered by Amex Life Insurance Co., the American Express unit, to the parent company's credit-card holders
Amex said it would charge me $576 a year for $100,000 of coverage -- and would pay me back all the premiums I put in if I canceled the policy after 10 years.Sounds great -- or does it
Second, the $5,760 I'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by 10 years of inflation; Amex, not I, would get the benefit of the investment income on my money
Third and most important, Amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount; I'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile
I'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile.That would be all right with Amex, which could then lock in its investment profit, but it doesn't add up to a "smart money" move for me
Which goes to show that the First Law applies in insurance as in anything else: There is no free lunch, there is only marketing
If I die early, I win -- a hollow victory, since I can't enjoy it -- and if I live long, the insurer wins.Always
This is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance, the kind that amasses cash value.The word "death" cannot be escaped entirely by the industry, but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms, preferring to talk about "savings" and "investment" instead
but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms, preferring to talk about "savings" and "investment" instead.The implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some kind of CD or mutual-fund account with an added feature
That is gilding the lily.The fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle, insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into
The fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle, insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into.That's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package
That's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package.Again, no free lunch
And in most cases, a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is, in effect, paying the salesman's commission as well; investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years, largely because of this
The simplest, most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy.You pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage, the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing, and your cash value and dividends grow over the years
One newer wrinkle has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons; the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy "loans," and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment
I'm not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately, so I look into the broad category called universal life.it is far more flexible than straight whole life
Hugely popular, it is far more flexible than straight whole life.I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment
I can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment; I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year
In looking at these and other policies, I learn to ask pointed questions about some of the assumptions built into "policy illustrations" -- the rows of numbers that show me the buildup of my cash values over the years.They commonly give two scenarios: One is based on interest rates that the company guarantees (usually 4% to 4.5%) and the other on the rate it is currently getting on investment, often 8.5% or more
Also, some policy illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year.These are not certain, either
Companies "aren't comfortable playing these games, but they realize they're under pressure to make their policies look good," says Timothy Pfiefer, an actuarial consultant at Tillinghast, a unit of Towers Perrin Co., the big New York consulting firm.Another factor to consider: Some of the companies currently earning very high yields are doing so through substantial investment in junk bonds, and you know how nervous the market has been about those lately
At a back-yard barbecue, for example, a friend boasts that she'll only have to pay premiums on her John Hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be "guaranteed." I call her agent, David Dominici
Yes, he says, premiums on such variable-rate coverage can be structured to "vanish" after a certain period -- but usually only if interest rates stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection.If interest rates plunge, the insurer may be knocking on my door, asking for steeper premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection
If interest rates plunge, the insurer may be knocking on my door, asking for steeper premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection.I don't like the sound of that
So-called living-benefits provisions also merit a close inspection.these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I'm still alive
these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I'm still alive.Some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays
Some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays; others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as cancer, heart attarcks, renal failure and kidney transplants
I'm more favorably impressed by "no-load life," even though it turns out to be low-load life.Insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise don't use commissioned salesmen
Insureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise don't use commissioned salesmen; there is still a load -- annual administrative fees and initial "setup" charges -- but I figure that the lack of commission and of "surrender fees" for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot
I compared one universal policy for $130,000 face amount from such an insurer, American Life Insurance Corp. of Lincoln, Neb., with a similar offering from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., which operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen.After one year I could walk away from the Ameritas policy with $792, but Id get only $14 from the Equitable

When his Seventh Avenue fur business here was flying high 20 years ago, Jack Purnick had 25 workers and a large factory.Now his half-dozen employees work in an eighth-floor shop that he says is smaller than his old storage room
he is losing money now.He blames imports
But just down Seventh Avenue, where about 75% of U.S. fur garments are made, Larry Rosen has acquired two retail outlets, broadened his fur-making line and expanded into leather.He credits imports
The difference lies in how the two entrepreneurial furriers reacted to the foreign competition and transformation of their industry over the past 10 years.One stuck to old-line business traditions, while the other embraced the change
The small, good fur salon is not what it used to be.We make the finest product in the world, and the Americans are being kicked around

Import competition for U.S. furs has risen sharply since furriers started aggressively marketing "working-girl mink" and similar lower-priced imported furs in recent years.Merchants discovered a consumer largely ignored by higher-priced furriers
Merchants discovered a consumer largely ignored by higher-priced furriers: the younger woman -- even in her late 20s -- who never thought she could buy a mink.The new market helped boost U.S. fur sales to about $1.8 billion a year now, triple the level in the late 1970s

But low-priced and middle-priced furriers like Mr. Purnick say imports have cut their sales.A woman who once would have saved for two or three seasons to buy a U.S.-made mink can now get an imported mink right away for less than $2,000
Yet Mr. Rosen has turned the import phenomenon to his advantage.Early in the decade he saw that fur workers in many foreign countries were willing to work longer hours at lower wages than their American counterparts and were more open to innovation

By combining his strengths in innovation and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad, he says he has been able to produce high-quality goods at low cost.To maintain control over production and avoid overdependence on foreign sources, he says he still makes most of his furs in the U.S

The animal-rights movement hasn't helped sales.Warm winters over the past two years have trimmed demand, too
And those who didn't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages. "The intensive labor needed to manufacture furs {in the U.S.} is not as available as it was
But even those who have found a way to cope with the imports and the slump, fear that furs are losing part of their allure. "People are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of the fur business," says Stephen Sanders, divisional merchandise manager for Marshall Field's department store in Chicago

But wait a second.Westridge Capital is an index fund -- the type of stolid long-term investor whose goal is to be nothing more than average
Westridge Capital's frenetic trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously sleepy world of indexing.Indexing for the most part has involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to mirror a stock market barometer, such as Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, and match its performance
Institutional investors have poured $210 billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns.These big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few "active" stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the S&P 500 or other bellwethers, much less beat it
And the fees investors pay for indexing run a few pennies for each $100 of assets.That's because computers do most of the work, and low trading activity keeps a lid on commission costs
But today, indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one.Because index-fund managers are no longer satisfied with merely being average, they have developed "enhanced" indexing strategies that are intended to outperform the market as much as three percentage points
Indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade, but the index money has been just sort of sitting there.Now the interest is in what else can I do with that money
Now the interest is in what else can I do with that money." Among the souped-up indexing strategies: Indexed portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks, or just a few dozen, rather than being restricted to the S&P 500 companies
Indexed portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks, or just a few dozen, rather than being restricted to the S&P 500 companies.They can ignore the S&P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks, such as smaller companies, those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry, state or country
that indexing's rapid growth is slowing, particularly for those "plain vanilla" funds that mirror the S&P 500. "There isn't a boatload {of big investors} out there still waiting to get into indexing
There isn't a boatload {of big investors} out there still waiting to get into indexing," says P. James Kartalia, vice president of ANB Investment Management Co., Chicago, which offers both indexing and active management services. (After tripling in size in the past five years, index funds now hold about 20% of the stock owned by pension funds
A further problem is razor-thin profits.Plain-vanilla funds have become so commonplace that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing, and in some cases are just that

Strategies vary for Westridge Capital, which has $300 million under management.The firm sometimes buys S&P 500 futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks, and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock-index futures to take advantages of any momentary price discrepencies
And in some months, he buys stock-index futures and not stocks at all. "By their nature, our trades are very short-term and are going to create high turnover
By their nature, our trades are very short-term and are going to create high turnover.The more turnover, the better for our clients

Prudential currently is seeking approval to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the S&P 500 index plus 5/100 of a percentage point.An added feature is that the slighty improved return would be guaranteed by Prudential
There are many other strategies to bolster the returns of index funds.They include: LIMITED RISK FUNDS
LIMITED RISK FUNDS: These guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains

The 473 funds tracked by the Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade group, rose to $356.1 billion, a record.The $6.07 billion increase was the strongest weekly inflow since January 1988
The increase was spread fairly evenly among all three types of funds.Individual investors, represented in the general-purpose and broker-dealer fund categories, pulled money from the stock market after its big drop last Friday and put the money into funds, said Jacob Dreyer, vice president and chief economist of the Institute
Yields on money funds dropped in the week ended Tuesday, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass., newsletter.The average seven-day compounded yield fell to 8.55% from 8.60% the week earlier
The 142 institutional-type money funds rose $2.23 billion to $85.49 billion.The 235 general-purpose funds increased $2.53 billion to $116.56 billion
The predicament was similar to the Hong Kong 1982-83 property-price collapse, which exposed the involvement of Bank Bumiputra's former subsidiary in the colony in the largest banking scandal in Malaysia's history.The subsidiary, Bumiputra Malaysia Finance Ltd., was left with M$2.26 billion in bad loans made to Hong Kong property speculators
Both episodes wiped out Bank Bumiputra's shareholders' funds.Each time, the bank's 90% shareholder -- Petroliam Nasional Bhd., or Petronas, the national oil company -- has been called upon to rescue the institution
Each time, the bank's 90% shareholder -- Petroliam Nasional Bhd., or Petronas, the national oil company -- has been called upon to rescue the institution.In five years, Petronas has spent about M$3.5 billion to prop up the troubled bank
the capital restructuring plan has been approved by Malaysia's Capital Issues Committee and central bank.Malaysia's High Court is expected to approve the plan
and the bank will be on track to report a pretax profit of between M$160 million and M$170 million for the fiscal year ending March 31.For the previous financial year, the bank would have reported a pretax profit of M$168 million if it hadn't made provisions for the nonperforming loans
But public documents indicate 10% or more of the bank's provisions were made for foregone interest on a M$200 million loan to Malaysia's dominant political party, the United Malays National Organization, to build its convention and headquarters complex in Kuala Lumpur.The loan to UMNO was made in September 1983
As well as the M$1.23 billion in provisions announced on Oct. 6, the restructuring package covers an additional M$450 million in provisions made in earlier years but never reflected in a reduction of the bank's paid-up capital.At the end of the exercise, the cash injection from Petronas will increase the bank's paid-up capital to M$1.15 billion after virtually being wiped out by the new provisions

the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for Mr. Courter.Unless he closes the gap, Republicans risk losing not only the governorship but also the assembly next month
Unless he closes the gap, Republicans risk losing not only the governorship but also the assembly next month.Going into the 1990s, the GOP is paying a price for the same conservative social agenda that it used to torment Democrats in the past
This change comes less from a shift in public opinion than in the boundaries of the debate.New Jersey's own highest court remains a liberal bulwark against major restrictions on abortion, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Webster vs.Missouri, has engaged voters across the nation who had been insulated from the issue
Before July, pro-choice voters could safely make political decisions without focusing narrowly on abortion.Now, the threat of further restrictions adds a new dimension, bringing an upsurge in political activity by abortion-rights forces
Now, the threat of further restrictions adds a new dimension, bringing an upsurge in political activity by abortion-rights forces.A recent pro-choice rally in Trenton drew thousands, and in a major reversal, Congress is defying a presidential veto and demanding that Medicaid abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest

Abortion alone can't explain this shift, but New Jersey is a model of how so personal an issue can become a baseline of sorts in judging a candidate.By a 2-to-1 ratio, voters appear more at ease with Mr. Florio's stance on abortion, and polls indicate his lead widens when the candidates are specifically linked to the issue
The times are my times," says Mr. Florio.The Camden County congressman still carries himself with a trademark "I'm-coming-down-your-throat" intensity, but at a pause in Newark's Columbus Day parade recently, he was dancing with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city's old Italian-American ward
The Camden County congressman still carries himself with a trademark "I'm-coming-down-your-throat" intensity, but at a pause in Newark's Columbus Day parade recently, he was dancing with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city's old Italian-American ward.After losing by fewer than 1,800 votes in the 1981 governor's race, he has prepared himself methodically for this moment, including deciding in recent years he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for Medicaid abortions
Mr. Courter, by comparison, seems a shadow of the confident hawk who defended Oliver North before national cameras at Iran-Contra hearings two years ago.Looking back, he says he erred by stating his "personal" opposition to abortion instead of assuring voters that he wouldn't impose his views on "policy" as governor
Looking back, he says he erred by stating his "personal" opposition to abortion instead of assuring voters that he wouldn't impose his views on "policy" as governor.It is a distinction that satisfies neither side in the debate

Even abortion opponents, however angry with Mr. Florio, can't hide their frustration with the Republican's ambivalence. "He doesn't want to lead the people," says Richard Traynor, president of New Jersey Right to Life
Moreover, by stepping outside the state's pro-choice tradition, Mr. Courter aggravates fears that he is too conservative as well on more pressing concerns such as auto insurance rates and the environment.He hurt himself further this summer by bringing homosexual issues into the debate
Elected to Congress in 1978, the 48-year-old Mr. Courter is part of a generation of young conservatives who were once very much in the lead of the rightward shift under Mr. Reagan.Like many of his colleagues, he didn't serve in Vietnam in the 1960s yet embraced a hawkish defense and foreign policy
but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate, pro-choice Gov. Kean.While the Warren County congressman pursued an anti-government, anti-tax agenda in Washington, Gov. Kean was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of New Jersey's budget in his eight years in office
but this history makes it harder for the conservative to run against government.Mr. Courter's free-market plan to bring down auto insurance rates met criticism from Gov. Kean's own insurance commissioner
Fluent in Spanish from his days in the Peace Corps, Mr. Courter actively courts minority voters but seems oddly over his head.He is warm and polished before a Puerto Rican Congress in Asbury Park.Yet minutes after promising to appoint Hispanics to high posts in state government, he is unable to say whether he has ever employed any in his congressional office

But many economists were not nearly as jubilant.The climb in wholesale energy prices is certain to push up retail energy prices in the next few months
I think inflation is going to pick up through the fall.It has been in what I would describe as a lull for the past several months
But retail energy prices declined 0.9% in September.Though analysts say competition will probably hold down increases in retail energy prices, many expect some of the wholesale rise to be passed along to the consumer before the end of the year
Still, some analysts insisted that the worst of the inflation is behind. "It increasingly appears that 1987-88 was a temporary inflation blip and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem," argued Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York
In both 1987 and 1988, consumer prices rose 4.4%.A run-up in world oil prices last winter sent consumer prices soaring at a 6.7% annual rate in the first five months of this year, but the subsequent decline in energy prices has pulled the annual rate back down to 4.4%
Mr. Yardeni predicted that world business competition will continue to restrain prices. "The bottom line is, it seems to me that the economic environment has become very, very competitve for a lot of businesses
The bottom line is, it seems to me that the economic environment has become very, very competitve for a lot of businesses.Back in 1987-88, business was operating at fairly tight capacity, so businesses felt they could raise prices
Back in 1987-88, business was operating at fairly tight capacity, so businesses felt they could raise prices." Now a slowdown in economic activity has slackened demand
The mild inflation figures renewed investors' hopes that the Federal Reserve will ease its interest-rate stance.The steep climb in producer prices reported last Friday fostered pessimism about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market's 6.9% plunge that day
In the past several days, however, the U.S.'s central bank has allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly to try to stabilize the markets.Fed policy makers have been wary of relaxing credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy
Excluding the volatile categories of energy and food consumer prices still rose only 0.2% in September.Transportation costs actually fell 0.5%, and housing costs gained only 0.1%

A few years ago, parents usually had to hire a sitter or take turns skiing while one spouse stayed with the children. "Most parents who had to go through that never came back
To make skiing more convenient for time-strapped visitors, several resorts are buying or starting their own travel agencies.In one phone call, ski buffs can make hotel and restaurant reservations, buy lift tickets, rent ski equipment and sign up for lessons
because skiing is still expensive: a lift ticket can cost up to $35 a day and equipment prices are rising
And most vacationers still prefer a warm climate for their winter excursions.that only 34% believe their clients will pick a trip this winter based on the availability of winter sports, as opposed to 69% who think that warm-weather sports will be the deciding factor
Even if they could bring in that many new skiers, I don't know if {the industry} could handle that kind of an increase.Most people will come on the weekend, the slopes will be overcrowded and then these {new skiers} won't come back

Another 20% of the borrowed funds would come from the sale to investors of junk bonds, which offer less security and typically carry higher yields than bank loans.Mr. Checchi's purchase of NWA, Mr. Batchelder notes, "was probably the most aggressive to date," with bank debt at 85% of the purchase price

Beyond the current weakness in the junk bond market, banks have another advantage over investment banks in financing contested takeovers.that "a political and emotional bias" has developed against junk bonds
One hostile bidder who deliberately avoided using junk bonds was Paramount Communications Inc. in its initial offer to acquire Time Inc. for $10.7 billion, or $175 a share.that decision was based on the financial, not political, drawbacks of junk bonds

The nation's fourth-largest steelmaker earned $18.3 million, or 43 cents a share, compared with $61 million, or $1.70 a share, a year earlier, when the industry was enjoying peak demand and strong pricing.Sales fell to $981.2 million from $1.02 billion

higher prices for galvanized and cold-rolled products offset lower prices for bar, hot-rolled and structural steel.Structural steel, which primarily serves the construction market, was especially hurt by a 15% price drop
its integrated steel sector was also hurt by higher raw material, repair and maintenance, and labor costs.The increased labor costs became effective Aug. 1 under terms of the four-year labor agreement with the United Steelworkers union
The "seismic" activity of a financial market bears a resemblance to the seismic activity of the earth.When things are quiet (low volatility), the structures on which markets stand can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately
And liquidity is what markets need to damp quakes and aftershocks.In today's markets, specialists (on the New York Stock Exchange) and "upstairs" market makers (in the over-the-counter market) are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the price-determination process
In today's markets, specialists (on the New York Stock Exchange) and "upstairs" market makers (in the over-the-counter market) are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the price-determination process.When they halt trading, all market liquidity is gone
Last Friday the 13th (as well as two years ago this week) the markets became unlinked.When that happened, "seismic" tremors of fear coursed through the market and increased the market's volatility

Lack of important, needed information can cause fear.Fear is the father of panic
Fear is the father of panic.Panic frequently results in irrational behavior
When market tremors start, it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve (buy and sell orders at various prices) be made available to all, not just to market makers.Because of a lack of information and access, many investors are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed
Because of a lack of information and access, many investors -- including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed, because of their ignorance of important market information.To add aftershock-damping power to America's markets, a modern, electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena (and the information that would automatically accompany such access) by investors -- particularly institutional investors
Contrary to some opinions, the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole.What market makers provide is immediacy, a very valuable service
What market makers provide is immediacy, a very valuable service.Liquidity is not a service
Liquidity is not a service.It is a market attribute
As a result the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction: The unwanted position is still an unwanted position
The unwanted position is still an unwanted position; only the identity of the seller has changed
In an open electronic system, any investor wishing to pay for real-time access to the trading arena through a registered broker-dealer would be able to see the entire supply-demand curve (buy and sell orders at each price) entered by dealers and investors alike, and to enter and execute orders.Current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants -- not just those of intermediaries who become extremely risk-averse during times of crisis
The recession, that is.The economy's stutter steps leave investors wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up
The economy's stutter steps leave investors wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up.So often are government statistics revised that they seem to resemble a spinning weather vane
For the past seven years, investors have had the wind at their backs, in the form of a generally growing economy.Some may have forgotten what it's like to invest during a recession
Some may have forgotten what it's like to invest during a recession.Different tactics are called for, as losing money becomes easier and making money becomes tougher
In a nutshell, pros advise investors who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big companies in "defensive" industries.A heavy dose of cash is prescribed, along with a heavier-than-usual allotment to bonds -- preferably government bonds
because recessions often take investors by surprise. "They always seem to come a bit later than you expect
They always seem to come a bit later than you expect.When they do hit, they hit fast
Interest rates almost always decline during recession." As surely as a seesaw tilts, falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds
As surely as a seesaw tilts, falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds.They are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do
But short-term bonds can't rise too much.Long-term bonds swing more widely in price
But not just any bonds will do.Corporate bonds "are usually not a good bet in a recession
Corporate bonds "are usually not a good bet in a recession.As times get tougher, investors fret about whether companies will have enough money to pay their debts
As times get tougher, investors fret about whether companies will have enough money to pay their debts.This hurts the price of corporate bonds
That means that a corporation, after a specified amount of time has passed, can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value (plus, in some cases, a sweetener).When interest rates have dropped, it makes sense for corporations to do just that
When interest rates have dropped, it makes sense for corporations to do just that; they then save on interest costs
If corporate bonds are bad in recessions, junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all.It's an "absolute necessity" to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing
It's an "absolute necessity" to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing.Such bonds are very sensitive to the downside
Municipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession, but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal government.During an economic slump, local tax revenues often go down, raising the risks associated with at least some municipals
But a few experts don't think bonds would help investors even if a recession is in the offing.One of these is Jeffrey L. Beach, director of research for Underwood Neuhaus & Co., a brokerage house in Houston, who thinks that "we're either in a recession or about to go into one
who thinks that "we're either in a recession or about to go into one." What's more, he thinks this could be a nastier recession than usual

and also shunning bonds.Because he sees a "5% to 6% base rate of inflation in the economy," he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon
Greg Confair, president of Sigma Financial Inc. in Allentown, Pa., also recommends that investors go heavily for cash.He isn't sure a recession is coming
This late in an expansion," the economy tends to veer off either into damaging inflation or into a recession.The Federal Reserve Board's plan for a "soft landing requires the Fed to navigate "an ever-narrowing corridor

It has to be engineered over and over again, month after month.that the task facing Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is so difficult that it resembles "juggling a double-bladed ax and a buzz saw
And, in a sense, that's the kind of task individuals face in deciding what to do about stocks.It comes down to a question of whether to try to "time" the market
For people who can ride out market waves through good times and bad, stocks have been rewarding long-term investments.that buy-and-hold investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of 9% to 10%
Most studies show that buy-and-hold investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of 9% to 10%, including both dividends and price appreciation.That's well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid
investors shouldn't even worry too much about timing. "Trying to time the economy is a mistake
Trying to time the economy is a mistake," says David Katz, chief investment officer of Value Matrix Management Inc. in New York.that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years
that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years.Investors who listened, and lightened up on stocks, "have just hurt themselves
that people who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right about 70% of the time to beat a buy-and-hold strategy.Frequent trading runs up high commission costs
Still, few investors are able to sit tight when they are convinced a recession is coming.After all, in all five recessions since 1960, stocks declined
After all, in all five recessions since 1960, stocks declined.According to Ned Davis, president of Ned Davis Research Inc. in Nokomis, Fla., the average drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was about 21%, and the decrease began an average of six months before a recession officially started
By the time a recession is "official much of the damage to stocks has already been done.About six months before a recession ends, stocks typically begin to rise again
But whatever their advice about timing, none of these experts recommend jettisoning stocks entirely during a recession.For the portion of an investor's portfolio that stays in stocks, professionals have a number of suggestions

Low P-E" stocks vastly outperform others "during a recession or bear market." In good times they lag a bit
Prof.Arbel urges investors to discard stocks in small companies.Small-company shares typically fall more than big-company stocks in a recession
For example, Mr. Arbel says, stocks of small companies are selling for about 19 times cash flow. (Cash flow, basically earnings plus depreciation, is one common gauge of a company's financial health
For example stocks of small companies are selling for about 19 times cash flow. (Cash flow, basically earnings plus depreciation, is one common gauge of a company's financial health.) That ratio is dangerously close to the ratio of 19.7 that prevailed before the 1987 stock-market crash
Another major trick in making a portfolio recession-resistant is choosing stocks in "defensive" industries.Food, tobacco, drugs and utilities are the classic examples
Food, tobacco, drugs and utilities are the classic examples.Recession or not, people still eat, smoke, and take medicine when they're sick
George Putnam III, editor of Turnaround Letter in Boston, offers one final tip for recession-wary investors. "Keep some money available for opportunities," he says
Keep some money available for opportunities.If the recession does hit, there will be some great investment opportunities just when things seem the blackest
Some industry groups consistently weather the storm better than others.The following shows the number of times these industries outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index during the first six months of the past seven recessions
The issue by Chicago & North Western is one of the so-called good junk-bond offerings on the new-issue calendar.Some analysts said the restructuring of the railroad concern's issue shows how tough it is for underwriters to sell even the junk bonds of a company considered to be a relatively good credit risk
Since last week's junk-bond market debacle, many new issues of high-yield, high-risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back, delayed or dropped.On Wednesday, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had to slash the size of Continental Airlines' junk-bond offering to $71 million from $150 million

The equity arrangement apparently would allow bondholders to buy a total of 10% of the stock of CNW Corp., Chicago & North Western's parent company.Donaldson Lufkin declined to comment on the restructuring
According to some analysts familiar with the negotiations, the 10% of equity would come directly from Donaldson Lufkin and a fund affiliated with the investment bank Blackstone Group, which would reduce their CNW equity holdings by 5% each.That would leave the Blackstone fund with a 60% stake and Donaldson Lufkin with 15%

Collectively, the statements raised questions about whether a new bid for UAL will ever get off the ground.The transaction has had a series of setbacks since the financing problems became known last Friday, with no signs or statements from the buy-out group to indicate that any progress has taken place
However, in response to the British Air decision, United's pilot union vowed to continue efforts to revive the buy-out.advisers to UAL management and the union will begin meeting in New York today and will work through the weekend to devise a new proposal to present to UAL's board "at the earliest time possible
advisers to UAL management and the union will begin meeting in New York today and will work through the weekend to devise a new proposal to present to UAL's board "at the earliest time possible." Pilot union advisers appeared confident that a new bid could go forward even without British Air's participation
UAL declined to comment on British Air's statement.UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, who is leading the management end of the buy-out, hasn't provided investors with any assurances about the prospect of a new deal
In another setback yesterday, United's machinist union asked the Treasury Department to investigate whether certain aspects of the original buy-out proposal violated tax laws.In an effort to derail the buy-out, the union has already called for investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Transportation Department and Labor Department
But there was one bright spot yesterday.The United flight-attendants union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in exchange for an ownership stake
The United flight-attendants union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in exchange for an ownership stake.The pilot union, the only one to support the buy-out thus far, said the flight attendants' decision "enforces our belief that an all-employee owned airline is practical and achievable
We're in no way committed to a deal going through at all.We're not rushing into anything
We're not rushing into anything.We don't want to be party to a second rejection
Indeed, British Air seemed to be distancing itself from the troubled transaction early in an effort to avoid any further embarrassment.The original transaction fell through on the same day British Air shareholders approved the plan at a special meeting after the British succeeded in arranging the financing for its equity contribution
The carrier also seemed eager to place blame on its American counterparts. "The {buy-out} consortium ceased to exist because our American partners were not capable of organizing the financing," a British Air spokesman said
British Airways may have begun to have second thoughts about the transaction after the Transportation Department forced Northwest's Airlines' new owners to restructure the equity contribution of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in that carrier.it planned to curtail foreign ownership stakes in U.S. carriers
Even before British Air's announcement, pilot union leaders had been meeting in Chicago yesterday to consider their options.The leaders expressed support for trying to revive the bid following a briefing Wednesday by the union's advisers, Lazard Freres & Co. and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind Wharton & Garrison
UAL's advisers have indicated previously that it may take a while to come forward with a revised plan since they want to have firm bank commitments before launching a new bid.They have maintained that banks remain interested in financing the transaction

A core group of six or so Democratic senators has been working behind the scenes to develop a proposal to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets.The plan was complete except for finishing touches, and there was talk that it would be unveiled as early as yesterday
But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine), a vigorous opponent of the capital-gains tax cut, called the group to meet with him Wednesday night and again yesterday.Sen. Mitchell urged them to desist

The Packwood plan, as expected, would allow individuals to exclude from income 5% of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year.The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held, until it reached a maximum of 35% after seven years.The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1
For corporations, the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33% from the current top rate of 34%.That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29% for corporate assets held for 15 years
The Packwood plan also would include a proposal, designed by Sen. William Roth (R., Del.), that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts.The Roth plan would create a new, non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement, but also for the purchase of a first home, education expenses and medical expenses

The author of the futuristic novel "1984" invented a language called Newspeak that made it impossible to fully develop a heretical thought -- that is, anything negative about the policies and practices of the state.Wall Street hasn't gotten that far yet, but it has made a promising start
Its language -- call it Streetspeak -- is increasingly mellifluous, reassuring, and designed to make financial products and maneuvers appear better, safer or cheaper than they really are.When something undeniably nasty happens, a few euphemisms are deployed to simply make it disappear, much as a fresh grave may be covered by a blanket of flowers

Recruited from New York University's MBA program, he rose within two years to head of production, overseeing such films as "The Way We Were," "Taxi Driver," "Tommy" and "Shampoo." In 1976, he teamed up with record producer Neil Bogart in Casablanca Records and Filmworks -- later called Polygram Pictures -- where they produced such hits as as "The Deep," and "Midnight Express

But it paled by comparison to what Sony was to offer last month: the chance, at last, to run a major studio, about $50 million in deferred compensation, up to 10% of Columbia's future cash flow, 8% of the future appreciation of Columbia's market value, and annual salaries of $2.7 million for each.The producers' 28% share of publicly held Guber Peters would net them an additional $50 million

The two sides now are accusing each other of lying.Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters claim they have an oral agreement with Warner executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise
But in affidavits filed yesterday in the Los Angeles court, Mr. Ross, Warner Bros.Chairman Robert Daly and President Semel deny that such an oral agreement was ever made.Warner, in its court filings, calls it "a piece of fiction created for this litigation
and the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner wasn't as strong as it is now.Warner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights, and it was "in Warner's interest to accommodate MGM/UA, Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives
that it is in its own interests to let Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters go off to Columbia.At the very least an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of flesh from Sony
During settlement talks, for example, Warner demanded such things as cable TV rights to Columbia movies and Columbia's interest in the studio it jointly owns with Warner, according to executives involved in the talks.In any settlement, Warner is almost certain to demand rights to most of the 50 or so projects Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters have locked up for the next few years, notably sequels to "Batman

First, there's the name: "asset-backed securities." Better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing
And there's more.The assets backing the securities come from some of the country's biggest -- and most secure -- institutions
The assets backing the securities come from some of the country's biggest -- and most secure -- institutions.Most earn high ratings from credit agencies
The assets backing the securities come from some of the country's biggest -- and most secure -- institutions.Most earn high ratings from credit agencies.Their yields are higher than those of U.S. Treasury issues
Well, think twice.The concept may be simple: Take a bunch of loans, tie them up in one neat package, and sell pieces of the package to investors.But the simplicity may be misleading
the slightly higher returns aren't enough to compensate for the extra risk.They warn that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them -- and those are hard to evaluate
A lot of this stuff really is in untested waters.We don't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn
Such concerns, however, haven't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of Wall Street's hottest new products.Since the spring of 1985, financial alchemists have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities
They have sold issues backed by car loans, boat loans and recreational-vehicle loans.They have offered bundles of homeequity loans, as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time-shares
They have offered bundles of homeequity loans, as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time-shares.Last year, there was an issue of "death-backed bonds
Last year, there was an issue of "death-backed bonds" -- securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders.Some predict there will be "Third World bonds," backed by loans to Brazil, Argentina and other debt-ridden nations
This is the heyday of debt.Before the sun sets on the '80s, it seems nothing will be left unhocked
The result is a $45 billion market, according to Securities Data Co.That includes more than $9.5 billion issued through August of this year, up sharply from $6.5 billion in the comparable 1988 period -- and more than in all of 1987
and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market.The entry fee is affordable
The entry fee is affordable: Issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of $1,000
The trust then issues securities that are underwritten by Wall Street brokerage firms and offered to investors.Issues typically come with "credit enhancements," such as a bank letter of credit, and thus have received high credit ratings
the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers, while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions.Asset-backed securities "are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds
Consider a $500 million offering of 9% securities issued last spring and backed by Citibank credit-card receivables.The triple-A-rated issue offered a yield of only about 0.5 percentage point above four-year Treasury issues
The triple-A-rated issue offered a yield of only about 0.5 percentage point above four-year Treasury issues.On a $10,000 investment, that's a difference of only $50 a year
Moreover, the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable.That's why some investment managers, such as Alex Powers, a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank's private banking division, don't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax states
But Mr. Powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts, such as retirement plans.that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over Treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts
Another concern is liquidity.The secondary, or resale, market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues
The secondary, or resale, market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues.That could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature
That could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature.That's particularly true for certain of the securities, such as those backed by time-share loans
That's particularly true for certain of the securities, such as those backed by time-share loans. "You could see massive gyrations here because it's such a thinly traded market
In addition, an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds, or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange, can simply check newspaper listings.There aren't any such listings for asset-backed securities
Investors, for instance, may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities.It isn't
That means investors have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities, as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit ratings the issue has received.That also isn't easy
Take the "credit enhancements," which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond-insurance company.The letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities
But skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper.When you buy an asset-backed issue, you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties
When you buy an asset-backed issue, you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties.If a bank's credit rating was lowered because of, say, its loans to Third World nations, that could also affect the ratings, liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports
some money managers still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets.At a time when Americans are leveraged to their eyeballs, asset-backed investors may be taking a heady gamble that consumers will be able to repay loans in hard times
At the very least, a recession would prompt investors to buy the highest-quality bonds they can find -- that is, Treasurys.That could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset-backed securities, as well as make it tougher to unload the latter
But it could be much worse.Some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues
Some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues.For one thing, credit-card loans are unsecured
Nope, we still say to stick with Treasurys.Ratings are subject to change
Judging by a poll of Wall Street Journal readers conducted this summer by Erdos & Morgan Inc., serious investors have taken that advice to heart.Nearly 1,000 investors responded to the Journal's poll, providing an in-depth look at their portfolios
Those portfolios are remarkably diversified.By spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives, the respondents have protected themselves against squalls in any one area, be it stocks, bonds or real estate
The poll, conducted Aug. 7-28, also provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics.It found them in a cautious, but not downbeat, mood
Of 1,500 people sent a questionnaire, 951 replied.The response rate, more than 63%, allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence
The results can't be extrapolated to all investors, though.Journal readers are relatively affluent, with a median household income of between $75,000 and $99,000
Journal readers are relatively affluent, with a median household income of between $75,000 and $99,000.Nearly half of the respondents (47%) said their investment portfolio was worth $250,000 or more, and 17% said it was worth $1 million or more
For example, 12% of this year's respondents said they expect a recession within 12 months.Last year, only 8% were expecting a recession
An additional 56% of this year's respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next 12 months.Only 42% of last year's respondents anticipated slowing growth
Apparently, the respondents don't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much.A slim majority (51%) think stock prices will be higher in August 1990 than they were in August 1989
Their verdict on real estate is almost the same.Some 50% expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next 12 months
By contrast, only 32% expect an increase in the price of gold.Since gold tends to soar when inflation is high, that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control
many respondents were taking a better-safe-than sorry investment stance.Nearly a third said they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession
Nearly a third said they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession.For the most part, the changes were "slight
A buy-and-hold approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents.Most own two to 10 stocks, and buy or sell no more than three times a year
Most own two to 10 stocks, and buy or sell no more than three times a year.Some 71% had bought some stock in the past year
Some 71% had bought some stock in the past year; only 57% had sold any

About 33% considered another crash "likely," while about 63% said one is "unlikely." Those percentages hardly changed from the previous year's poll
And the respondents' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual.About 60% of them said they would "ordinarily" have at least 25% of their money in stocks.But as of August, only 50% actually had stock-market investments of that size

Row 21 of Section 9 of the Upper Reserved at Candlestick Park is a lofty perch, only a few steps from the very top of the stands.From my orange seat, I looked over the first-base line and the new-mown ball field in the warm sun of the last few minutes before what was to have been the third game of the World Series
It was five in the afternoon, but that was Pacific time.Back in New York the work day was already over, so I didn't have to feel guilty

Long lines of people waited to buy special souvenir World Series postcards with official postmarks.Thousands of us had paid $5 for the official souvenir book with its historical essays on Series trivia, its historical photographs of great moments in Series past, and its instructions, in English and Spanish, for filling in the scorecard
Players ran out on the field way below, and the stands began to reverberate.It must be a local custom stamping feet to welcome the team
And no one was shouting.No one around me was saying anything
Because we all were busy riding a wave.Sixty thousand surfers atop a concrete wall, waiting for the wipeout
Then I remembered the quake of '71, which I experienced in Santa Barbara in a second-story motel room.When the swaying of the building woke me up, I reasoned that a) I was in Southern California; b) the bed was moving; c) it must be a Magic Fingers bed that had short-circuited

But the lot might split into crevasses, so I had better stand on my car, which probably was wider than the average crevasse.Fortunately, the quake was over before I managed to run out and stand naked on the hood

In fact, the entire population of the Bay Area had ended up with this dual role of actor and audience.The reporters were victims and some of the victims turned into unofficial reporters

Mr. Cela himself was one of the lucky ones, his fortunes steadily increasing over the decades he spent putting out some 70 travelogues, novels, short story collections and poetry.These days, he is as known for his flamboyant tastes and the youthful muse who shares his life as he is for his books
These days, he is as known for his flamboyant tastes and the youthful muse who shares his life as he is for his books.The man who wore out his shoes wandering around Guadalajara in 1958, describing in his travel book "Viaje a la Alcarria" how he scrounged for food and stayed in squalid inns, now tours Spain in a Rolls-Royce
Of his 10 novels, "The Hive" (1951), full of sharp vignettes of Madrid life and centered on a cafe run by Dona Rosa, a foul-mouthed, broad-based woman with blackened little teeth encrusted in filth, used to be available in English, translated by J.M. Cohen and published by Ecco Press, which now no doubt regrets relinquishing its copyright.Here is an excerpt
The lonely woman walks on in the direction of the Plaza de Alonso Martinez.Two men have a conversation behind one of the windows of the cafe on the corner of the boulevard
Two men have a conversation behind one of the windows of the cafe on the corner of the boulevard.Both are young, one twenty odd, the other thirty odd
Both are young, one twenty odd, the other thirty odd.The older one looks like a member of the jury for a literary award, the younger one looks like a novelist
The older one looks like a member of the jury for a literary award, the younger one looks like a novelist.It is evident that their conversation runs more or less on the following lines: "I've submitted the manuscript of my novel under the title `Teresa de Cepeda, ' and in it I've treated a few neglected aspects of that eternal problem which
Oh, yes.Will you pour me a drop of water, if you don't mind
With pleasure.I've revised it several times and I think I may say with pride that there is not a single discordant word in the whole text
I think so.I don't know the quality of the works my colleagues have sent in, but in any case I feel confident that good sense and honest judgment
I don't doubt it for a moment.It does not matter if one is defeated, provided the work that gets the award has unmistakable qualities
It does not matter if one is defeated, provided the work that gets the award has unmistakable qualities.What's so discouraging is
The company earned $66 million, or $1.19 a share, on revenue of $2.1 billion in the year-ago fourth quarter.For fiscal 1988, Ashland had net of $224 million, or $4.01 a share, on revenue of $7.8 billion
For fiscal 1988, Ashland had net of $224 million, or $4.01 a share, on revenue of $7.8 billion.Both revenue figures exclude excise taxes
The charges consist of: a $25 million after-tax charge to cover cost overruns in Ashland's Riley Consolidated subsidiary; a previously announced $38 million after-tax charge resulting from a $325 million settlement with National Iranian Oil Co. and a $15 million after-tax charge from the previously announced sale of its Ashland Technology Corp. subsidiary.Ashland expects that sale to be complete next year
The charge for the Riley subsidiary is for expected costs to correct problems with certain bed boilers built for utilities.The charge will be added to $20 million in reserves established a year ago to cover the cost overruns
The Panamanian affair is only the tip of a more alarming iceberg.It originates in a Bush administration decision not to antagonize the U.S. Congress and avoid, at all costs, being accused of meddling in the region
and avoid, at all costs, being accused of meddling in the region.The result has been a dangerous vacuum of U.S. leadership
The result has been a dangerous vacuum of U.S. leadership, which leaves Central America open to Soviet adventurism. "The {influence of the} U.S. is not being felt in Central America; Washington's decisions do not respond to a policy, and are divorced from reality
The {influence of the} U.S. is not being felt in Central America; Washington's decisions do not respond to a policy
The disarray of the Bush administration's Latin diplomacy was evident in the failure of the Organization of American States to condemn categorically Gen. Noriega.Faced with this embarrassment, U.S. diplomats expressed confidence that the influential Rio Group of South American nations, which gathered last week in Peru, would take a stronger posture toward the Panamanian dictator
But other than a few slaps on the wrist, Gen. Noriega went unpunished by that body, too; he was not even singled out in the closing statement
Now Mr. Bush will come to Costa Rica and encounter Nicaraguan strongman Daniel Ortega, eager for photo opportunities with the U.S. president.The host, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, did not invite Chile, Cuba, Panama or Haiti to the summit, which was to be restricted to democracies
However, Mr. Ortega was included.Formally upgrading the Sandinistas to a democratic status was an initiative harshly criticized in the Costa Rican press
Formally upgrading the Sandinistas to a democratic status was an initiative harshly criticized in the Costa Rican press.Even Carlos Manuel Castillo made public his opposition to the presence of Nicaragua "in a democratic festivity
Nevertheless, the Bush administration agreed to the dubious arrangement in July.According to officials in Washington, the State Department hoped that by pleasing President Arias, it would gain his support to postpone any decision on the Contras until after Mr. Ortega's promises of democratic elections were tested next February
Prior to this episode, Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.), sensing an open field, undertook a personal diplomatic mission through Central America to promote an early disbanding of the rebels.Visiting Nicaragua, he praised the Sandinistas for their electoral system and chided the Bush administration for not rewarding the Sandinistas
Visiting Nicaragua, he praised the Sandinistas for their electoral system and chided the Bush administration for not rewarding the Sandinistas.In Honduras he promised to help unblock some $70 million in assistance withheld due to the failure of local agencies to comply with conditions agreed upon with Washington
Aid was also the gist of the talks Sen. Dodd had with Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani; Mr. Cristiani's government is very much at the mercy of U.S. largess and is forced to listen very carefully to Sen. Dodd's likes and dislikes
It was therefore not surprising that close allies of the U.S., virtually neglected by the Bush administration, ordered the Nicaraguan insurgents dismantled by December, long before the elections.Fittingly, the Tela Accords were nicknamed by Hondurans "the Dodd plan
The individual foreign policy carried out by U.S. legislators adds to a confusing U.S. performance that has emboldened Soviet initiatives in Central America.On Oct. 3, following conversations with Secretary of State James Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived in Managua to acclaim "Nicaragua's great peace efforts
On Oct. 3, following conversations with Secretary of State James Baker, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze arrived in Managua to acclaim "Nicaragua's great peace efforts." There, Mr. Shevardnadze felt legitimized to unveil his own peace plan: The U.S.S.R. would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to Nicaragua after the February election if the U.S. did likewise with its allies in Central America
There, Mr. Shevardnadze felt legitimized to unveil his own peace plan: The U.S.S.R. would prolong a suspension of arms shipments to Nicaragua after the February election if the U.S. did likewise with its allies in Central America
He also called on Nicaragua's neighbors to accept a "military equilibrium" guaranteed by both superpowers.The Pentagon claims that in spite of Moscow's words, East bloc weapons continue to flow into Nicaragua through Cuba at near-record levels
Since Mr. Shevardnadze's proposals followed discussions with Mr. Baker, speculations arose that the Bush administration was seeking an accommodation with the Soviets in Central America.This scheme would fit the Arias Plan, which declared a false symmetry between Soviet military aid to the Sandinista dictatorship and that provided by Washington to freely elected governments
The sad condition of U.S. policy in Central America is best depicted by the recent end to U.S. sponsorship of Radio Costa Rica.In 1984, the Costa Rican government requested help to establish a radio station in the northern part of the country, flooded by airwaves of Sandinista propaganda
In 1984, the Costa Rican government requested help to establish a radio station in the northern part of the country, flooded by airwaves of Sandinista propaganda.Recovering radiophonic sovereignty was the purpose of Radio Costa Rica, funded by the U.S. and affiliated with the Voice of America (VOA
A few months ago, the Bush administration decided to stop this cooperation, leaving Radio Costa Rica operating on a shoestring.According to news reports, the abrupt termination was due to fears that VOA transmissions could interfere with the peace process
In the meantime, Russia gave Nicaragua another powerful radio transmitter, which has been installed in the city of Esteli.It is capable of reaching the entire Caribbean area and deep into North America
It is capable of reaching the entire Caribbean area and deep into North America.Perhaps its loud signal may generate some awareness of the Soviet condominium being created in the isthmus thanks to U.S. default
The Soviet entrenchment in Nicaragua is alarming for Costa Rica, a peaceful democracy without an army.Questioned in Washington about what would happen if his much-heralded peace plan would fail, President Arias voiced expectations of direct U.S. action
President Arias voiced expectations of direct U.S. action.that 64% of Costa Ricans believe that if their country is militarily attacked by either Nicaragua or Panama, the U.S. will come to its defense
Holiday said third-quarter earnings rose to $39.8 million, or $1.53 a share, from $21 million, or 84 cents a share, a year earlier.Results for the quarter included $19.2 million in pretax gains from property transactions, including the sale of one Embassy Suites hotel, and $3.5 million of nonrecurring costs associated with the acquisition of the Holiday Inn business by Bass
Holiday said operating income related to gaming increased 4.5% to a record $61.4 million from $58.8 million a year earlier.The jump reflected record results in Las Vegas, Nev., and Atlantic City, N.J., as well as a full quarter's results from Harrah's Del Rio in Laughlin, Nev
For the nine months, earnings fell 2.9% to $99.1 million, or $3.86 a share, from $102.1 million, or $4.10 a share, a year earlier.Revenue dropped 1.6% to $1.21 billion from $1.23 billion
The tender offer and consent solicitation will be made to debtholders in December.In effect, Holiday is asking holders for permission for Bass to buy their debt
Holiday said Salomon Brothers Inc. has been retained to act as the dealer-manager and financial adviser in connection with the offer and solicitation.The debt issues involved and the proposed consent fees and cash tender offer prices (expressed per $1,000 of principal amount) are as follows: 10 1/2% senior notes due 1994 at 101%; 11% subordinated debt due 1999 at 102%; 9 3/8% notes due 1993 at 100%; and 8 3/8% notes due 1996 at 95.25%
Although such a venture wouldn't match the "fourth network" created by News Corp. 's Fox Broadcasting Co., MCA and Paramount may have similar ambitions.Fox, which also owns six TV stations, provides programs three nights a week to those and other affiliates
A spokeswoman for Paramount said the company doesn't comment on speculation.Calls to Shelly Schwab, president of MCA TV, weren't returned
The two companies, like Fox, already have their own TV stations.MCA owns WWOR in New York and Paramount last month agreed to purchase a 79% stake in the TVX Broadcast Group from Salomon Inc. in a deal valued at $140 million
MCA owns WWOR in New York and Paramount last month agreed to purchase a 79% stake in the TVX Broadcast Group from Salomon Inc. in a deal valued at $140 million.TVX owns five stations, including WTXF, a Fox affiliate, in Philadelphia
One broadcasting executive familiar with the project said the co-venture would target stations affiliated with Fox because Fox has the desirable independent stations in most of the key cities.Currently, Fox supplies programs on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays, although the company plans to expand to other weeknights
Fox wasn't pleased by the possible Paramount-MCA venture into prime-time programming. "To make the venture work, they would need Fox affiliates
To make the venture work, they would need Fox affiliates.We spent a lot of time and money in building our group of stations
The executive said Paramount and MCA have also held discussions with Chris-Craft Industries' broadcasting unit.A Chris-Craft station manager said there have been no formal talks
I think it's to Fox's advantage to be associated with the Paramount-MCA venture.the Fox shows appearing on nights when Paramount-MCA shows wouldn't be offered could be promoted on the programs produced by Paramount-MCA
The real question is whether the Paramount-MCA offering is practical.It isn't. . . . Why would I consider giving up Fox, a proven commodity," for an unknown venture
Under the agreement, BanPonce stockholders will be able to exchange each of their shares for either shares in the new entity or cash.In each case, the exchange is valued at $56.25 a share

Banco Popular originally proposed the merger in July.BanPonce reacted cooly at first
Banco Popular just kept waiting.They got a transaction that's good for both companies
The two banks appear to be a good fit.BanPonce caters to a more affluent customer, while Banco Popular has always had a large presence among middle-income and lower-income markets

the retrofitting was part of a planned, three-stage reinforcement of the Cypress structure begun by the California transportation department several years ago.The Cypress reinforcement project itself was part of an annual effort to shore up structures believed vulnerable to earthquakes
The Cypress reinforcement project itself was part of an annual effort to shore up structures believed vulnerable to earthquakes.The state began such work after a 1971 tremblor in Southern California, when numerous bridges collapsed
We had just finished phase two" of the Cypress project that involved installing a series of retaining cables designed to prevent sections of the roadway from separating as a result of seismic shock.After completing installation of the jackets on "one frame" of the freeway last year, the state DOT had sent the project over to its Sacramento engineers to draw up a final design
the project had been stymied somewhat by "the difficulty of designing" the jackets.The procedure involves encasing the concrete columns with steel, then connecting them more securely to the double-decker roadbed
the project may have been snagged by budgetary concerns.One preliminary estimate put the retrofitting cost at as much as $50 million
The collapse of the span has provoked surprise and anger among state officials.Gov. George Deukmejian called for an immediate investigation
I want to know who made the decision that it was safe for 186,000 people to use every day.he would convene hearings within two weeks
The Cypress structure opened in June 1957, and as such, like many buildings in the San Francisco Bay area, does not meet current building codes requiring considerably more steel support.The northern piers of the span lie in estuarian deposits that were of a type to have liquefied easily during the 1906 quake
they were as surprised as anyone by the Cypress destruction.They said previous earthquakes suggested that multiple-column viaducts would stand up well

Bonn and Washington have taken a leading role in aid for the reformist countries, pledging billions of dollars in fresh credit and forgiving old debt while urging other industrial nations to follow suit.Both hope to encourage pressure for change in East bloc countries still ruled by Stalinist holdouts by arranging liberal financial aid and trade benefits for Poland, Hungary and, to a lesser extent, the Soviet Union
History will judge us by whether we have taken the opportunities that emerge from these reforms." The ultimate aim of Western support for East bloc reforms is to create "an equitable and stable peaceful order in Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals
Mr. Genscher and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Robert A. Mosbacher, in separate speeches at the conference, appealed for more Western contributions to economic reforms and business development in Hungary and Poland.Bonn and Washington are leading supporters of Poland's request for a $1 billion stand-by credit from the International Monetary Fund
We want the bold programs of market development and political freedom in Hungary and in Poland to succeed.We are prepared to support those changes," said Mr. Mosbacher
Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives yesterday approved an $837.5 million aid package for Poland and Hungary that more than doubles the amount President Bush had requested.The package was brought to the House just 15 days after it was introduced, indicating Congress's eagerness to reward Poland and Hungary for their moves toward democracy and freemarket economic reforms

When Chancellor Helmut Kohl travels to Poland Nov. 9, he is expected to take with him a promise of three billion West German marks ($1.6 billion) in new credit guarantees for industrial projects.Last week, Bonn agreed to reschedule 2.5 billion marks in Polish debt that came due last year
In addition, a one billion mark credit dating from 1974 is to be written off.Poland's plan to switch to a free-market economy by 1991 is hampered by a foreign debt load of $39.2 billion
West Germany also has increased its credit guarantees to Hungary by 500 million marks to 1.5 billion marks.An additional 500 million marks in credit-backing was promised by the West German state governments of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg

The FTC ordered the companies not to use rating bureaus in those six states.The commission order named the following companies: Ticor Title Insurance Co. of California, a unit of Los Angeles-based Ticor; Chicago Title Insurance Co. and Safeco Title Insurance Co., units of Chicago Title & Trust Co.; Lawyers Title Insurance Corp., a unit of Richmond, Va.-based Universal Corp.; and Stewart Title Guaranty Co., a unit of Houston-based Stewart Information Services Corp.

ARCO maintains an office in Dallas that would take over if payroll operations in Pasadena were disrupted.Two months ago the company set up a toll-free number, based outside California, to handle queries from employees about when they should report back to work after an earthquake or other disaster
The ARCO plan takes into account such details as which aspects of business are busier at certain times of the year.This way, depending on when a quake might strike, priorities can be assigned to departments that should be brought back on line first
At Hewlett-Packard Co., the earthquake came just as the company was reviewing its own emergency procedures. "We were talking about scheduling a practice drill for November
to tell manufacturing and support staff to stay home Wednesday.Sales and service employees were asked to report to work to help Bay area clients who called with computer problems
Hewlett-Packard also called in its systems experts to restore its own computer operations. "That means we can accept orders" and begin getting back to normal
Some companies are confident that they're prepared.Occidental Petroleum Corp. holds regular evacuation drills and stocks food, oxygen and non-prescription drugs at checkpoints in its 16-story headquarters

However, operating profit fell 35% to $16.4 million.The decline reflected the expense of buying three magazines, lower earnings from the forest-products group, and what is proving to be a nagging major problem, continued declines in advertising linage at the New York Times, the company's flagship daily newspaper
Analysts said the company's troubles mirror those of the industry.Retail advertising largely isn't rebounding in the second half from extended doldrums as expected
At the same time, newspapers are bedeviled by lagging national advertising, especially in its financial component.Dow Jones & Co. recently reported net fell 9.9%, a reflection, in part, of continued softness in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and Barron's magazine

That news, plus recent signs of economic sluggishness, greatly increases pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease credit further.I see a lot of evidence indicating a slower economy, and that means my interest-rate outlook has a downward tilt," said Garnett L.

that, at least at the federal level, political "ticket splitting" has been on the rise over the past half century.In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20% of the nation's congressional districts choose a different party's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives.Now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been above 40%
In only one presidential election year prior to 1948 did more than 20% of the nation's congressional districts choose a different party's candidate for the White House than for the House of Representatives.Now that percentage routinely equals a third and twice has been above 40%
As we know, voters tend to favor Republicans more in races for president than in those for Congress.In every presidential election over the past half century, except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy, the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress
In every presidential election over the past half century, except for the Goldwater presidential candidacy, the GOP has captured a greater percentage of the major-party popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for Congress.Prior to 1932, the pattern was nearly the opposite
A simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split personality displayed by Americans in the voting booth.The theory relies on three assumptions
If these assumptions hold, voters in races for Congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner's dilemma and have an incentive, at the margin, to lean Democratic.If they put a Republican into office, not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from "bringing home the bacon" to their respective constituencies
but their selected legislator will be relatively powerless to prevent other legislators from "bringing home the bacon" to their respective constituencies.Each legislator, after all, is only one out of 535 when it comes to national policy making
In races for the White House, a voter's incentive, at the margin, is to lean Republican.Although a GOP president may limit local benefits to the voter's particular district/state, such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits
such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other districts/states and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits.The individual voter's standing consequently will be enhanced through lower taxes
Second, it explains why voters hold Congress in disdain but generally love their own congressional representatives: Any individual legislator's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency
For example, first-term members of the House, once the most vulnerable of incumbents, have become virtually immune to defeat.The one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982
The one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of 13 of the 52 freshman Republicans brought into office in 1980 by the Reagan revolution and running for re-election in 1982.Because these freshmen placed far more emphasis on their partisan role -- spreading the Reagan revolution -- in national policy making, they were more vulnerable to defeat
Fourth, the theory indicates why the Republican Party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office.Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent
Potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a Democratic opponent.To the extent that potential Republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner's dilemma game works to their disadvantage, the Republican Party will be hindered in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates
Fifth, the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly pronounced in the South.To the extent that Democratic legislators from the South have held a disproportionate share of power in Congress since 1932 and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective constituencies, voters in the South have had an especially strong incentive to keep such Democrats in office
Finally, the theory suggests why Republicans generally have fared better in Senate races than in campaigns for the House.Since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of Congress, this is precisely the pattern one would expect if Republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their Democratic counterparts
that GOP senators turn back roughly 10% more of their allocated personal staff budgets than Democrats do.To the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking, this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional Republicans to pay less attention to narrow constituent concerns
This is indeed what the data indicate, particularly in the case of the House.The Democratic House attendance rate has not exceeded the Republican House attendance rate since 1959
An additional piece of evidence from the Senate: Holding other factors constant, such as incumbency advantages and regional factors, the difference between popular votes for Republican presidential and senatorial candidates in states conducting a Senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government's tax burden is per state.Put more simply, GOP candidates for president are looked on more kindly by voters than Republican candidates for the Senate when the prisoner's dilemma is more severe
Moreover, ticket splitting appears to take the same peculiar pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level.State government is more typically split along Republican-governor/Democratic-legislature lines than the reverse
The measure provides no money for the promised payments until then, but beginning in fiscal 1991, the government would be committed to meeting annual payments of as much as $500 million until the total liability of approximately $1.25 billion is paid.The action abandons earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts to fund the payments, but is widely seen as a more realistic means of expediting reparations first authorized in 1988
The action came as Congress sent to President Bush a fiscal 1990 bill providing an estimated $156.7 billion for the Departments of Labor, Education, Health and Human Services.Final approval was on a 67-31 roll call in the Senate, which sets the stage for a veto confrontation with Mr. Bush over the issue of publicly financed abortions for poor women
Reversing an eight-year federal policy, the measure supports Medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest, but Mr. Bush has so far refused to support any specific exemption beyond instances in which the mother's life is in danger.Mr. Bush's veto power puts him a commanding position in the narrowly divided House, but a vote to override his position could well pick up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed in the underlying bill
The measure before the conference yesterday funds the Departments of State, Justice and Commerce through fiscal 1990.An estimated $1.32 billion is provided for next year's census, and negotiators stripped a Senate-passed rider seeking to block the counting of illegal aliens
Fiscal pressures also forced the adoption of new fees charged by federal agencies, and an 18% increase in the Securities and Exchange Commission's budget would be financed entirely by an added $26 million in filing fees.In an unprecedented step, the measure anticipates another $30 million in receipts by having the Federal Bureau of Investigation charge for fingerprint services in civil cases
and the assorted provisions attached by lawmakers run from $1.5 million for a fish farm in Arkansas to a music festival in Moscow under the United States Information Agency.Lawmakers scrapped all of a $7.4 million State Department request for the 1992 Expo in Seville, Spain, but agreed elsewhere to $15,000 for an oil portrait of former Chief Justice Warren Burger
Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings attached $10 million for an advanced technology initiative.His Republican counterpart, Sen. Warren Rudman (R., N.H.), has used his position to wage a legislative war with the conservative board of the Legal Services Corp
but Mr. Rudman also succeeded in attaching language seeking to curb the authority of the current board until new members are confirmed.The effective date of any new regulations by the current board would be delayed until Oct. 1 next year
The bill also provides $620.5 million to meet U.S. contributions to international organizations and $80 million for peace-keeping activities.Both accounts reflect significant increases from fiscal 1989
Watching Congress sweat and grimace through its annual budget labors, fighting the urge to spend more, we're reminded of those late-night movies in which the anguished serial killer turns himself in to police and says, "Stop me before I kill again." The Members know they're doing wrong, but they need help to restrain their darker compulsions

A good place to start the rehabilitation is a "legislative line-item veto" bill now being offered by Indiana Senator Dan Coats.The Coats bill, which already has 32 Senate co-sponsors, isn't a pure line-item veto because it would apply only to spending bills
Under the proposal, a President would have a chance twice each year to return a package of "rescissions" to the Hill -- once when he proposes his budget and again after Congress disposes.Congress would have 20 days to reject the package with a 50% majority
The proposal would restore some discipline erased from the budget process by the 1974 Budget "Reform" Act.Before 1974, a President could "impound," or refuse to spend, funds appropriated by Congress
Before 1974, a President could "impound," or refuse to spend, funds appropriated by Congress.Presidents Kennedy and Johnson were both big users of the impoundment power, but Congress saw its chance against a weakened President Nixon and stripped it away
Today a President can still send up spending rescissions, but they're meaningless unless Congress has a guilty conscience and changes its mind.This is like asking foxes to feel remorse about chickens
and naturally rescissions are almost never approved.In 1987, President Reagan sent 73 rescissions back to the Hill, but only 3% of the spending total was approved by Congress
In 1987, President Reagan sent 73 rescissions back to the Hill, but only 3% of the spending total was approved by Congress.Senator Coats's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless Congress acts
Senator Coats's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless Congress acts.The Members could still try to serve their constituents with special-interest goodies, but the police (in the form of a President) would be there with a straitjacket if they really get crazy, as they do now
Mr. Coats plans to offer his proposal as an amendment to a bill to raise the federal debt limit before the end of the month.President Bush has endorsed the idea, and at least 50 sitting Senators have voted to support enhanced rescission authority in the past
President Bush has endorsed the idea, and at least 50 sitting Senators have voted to support enhanced rescission authority in the past.but if he and his colleagues are serious about kicking their compulsions, they'll sign up
That is a minimum figure, and I underscore minimum.It's impossible to put an exact figure on it at this time

FEMA is already strapped by the costs of cleaning up after Hurricane Hugo.It is likely to get as much as $800 million initially in additional funds

In Laos, when the Western powers bowed to pressure for such a coalition it turned out they were opening the door to communist domination.Even Mao Tse-tung's China began in 1949 with a partnership between the communists and a number of smaller, non-communist parties
that the current regime is already communist, as are its Vietnamese overseers back in Hanoi, as are the Khmer Rouge -- who are the strongest of the three guerrilla groups.It's not clear which crew of communists might prevail in a coalition government, but the one good bet is that the non-communists would disappear

These utopians caused the deaths of well over one million Cambodians.The Cambodian horror was so bad that the Vietnamese occupation in 1978 was a perverse form of relief
But there is no solid evidence that the Khmer Rouge have changed.Some of our sources in Thailand say the notorious old Khmer Rouge leader, Pol Pot, has been holed up this summer in Khmer Rouge camps near the Thai-Cambodian border
So it's difficult to swallow the notion that Mr. Baker is willing to accept conditions that would help the Khmer Rouge set up shop again in Phnom Penh.True, Prince Sihanouk backs the idea of such a coalition, at least for this week
Nor should the U.S. worry much about offending China.It's time the State Department recognized that China does not play by gentlemen's rules

H&R Block is one of the great success stories of U.S. business.Oddly enough, this presents a problem for the stock
because they suspect the company's glory days are past, or at least passing.Block's tax-preparation business is mature and some of its diversifications are facing tough competition
It's no secret that Block dominates the mass-market tax-preparation business.The Street knows all about the predictability of its earnings, which are headed for a ninth consecutive yearly increase
The Street knows all about the predictability of its earnings, which are headed for a ninth consecutive yearly increase.The company has consistently earned more than a 20% annual return on its net worth while many companies would be happy with 15%
But the tax-preparation business simply has no more room to grow.You go to any medium-sized town in the U.S. and you're going to see H&R Block tax services

But some money managers are doing just that.Eugene Sit, president of Sit Investment Associates in Minneapolis, says, "When we bought it, we thought the growth rate was going to accelerate" because of computerized tax filing and instant refunds (the customer gets a refund immediately but pays extra to the tax preparer, which waits for Uncle Sam's check
But neither of those developments did much to juice up growth, Mr. Sit says.He figures Block earnings are now growing at about a 10% annual rate (down from about 14% the past five years) and will grow at an 8%-10% rate in the future
That's "not bad," Mr. Sit says, but it sure doesn't justify Block shares being priced at 15 to 16 times estimated earnings for fiscal 1990.He wants stocks whose price/earnings ratio is less than their growth rate; as he figures it, H&R Block doesn't even come close

Options lost some of their mystery in 1973 when the Chicago Board of Trade set up a special exchange to deal in them.Until then, options had been traded only in the over-the-counter market
So the men who ran the grain pits listened when Joseph Sullivan, a 35-year-old former Wall Street Journal newsman, offered them the idea of all-options trading.After four year of tinkering and $2.4 million in seed money, the board set up the new marketplace, titled it the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and named Sullivan its first president

In their quest to perfect apartheid, the Orange Workers have discovered a truth that most of privileged white South Africa tries mightily to deny: The master can't become dependent on the slave and expect to remain master forever

preliminary reports indicate the company wasn't materially affected by the Tuesday earthquake.All but eight of the 850 branches, which had some structural damage, reopened yesterday for business
For the first time in nearly two years, BankAmerica results failed to improve in consecutive quarters.Third-quarter profit was 16% below the $304 million, or $1.50 a share, earned in the 1989 second quarter
The company cited higher tax credits in the second quarter, totaling $63 million, compared with $28 million in the third quarter.Excluding tax credits, profit was 6% below the second quarter
Moreover, BankAmerica continued to build its reserve against troubled foreign loans by boosting its loan-loss provision to $170 million.The provision rate was far above BankAmerica's actual net credit losses of $24 million in the third quarter
As a result, BankAmerica said its reserve against troubled foreign-country loans, once below 25%, now amounts to 45% of the $6.4 billion of non-trade debt it calculates it is owed by those nations.That level is about the same as some other big banks, but far below the 85% and 100% reserves of Bankers Trust New York Corp. and J.P. Morgan & Co., respectively
By any measure, third-quarter earnings were still robust, equivalent to a 0.92% return on assets even excluding tax credits.By that key measure of operating efficiency, BankAmerica turned in a better performance than its well-regarded Los Angeles-based competitor, Security Pacific Corp., which posted a 0.89% return in the third quarter
But it continued to badly trail its San Francisco neighbor, Wells Fargo & Co., which reported an extraordinary 1.25% return on assets.Both returns don't include any tax credits
They {BankAmerica} continue to show good performance.In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, BankAmerica common stock edged up 12.5 cents to close at $32 a share
Shareholder equity improved to 4.68% from 4.23% in the previous quarter.The 4.52% net interest margin was still markedly higher than the 3.91% ratio a year earlier, and is among the best in the industry
The high margin partly stems from continued strong growth in high-yielding consumer loans, which jumped 31% to $17.47 billion from a year earlier, and residential mortgages, which rose 25% to $12 billion.BankAmerica's total loans rose 8% to $71.36 billion
So IBM will be announcing more than 50 products that will be aimed at letting even the dumbest machine tool talk to the smartest mainframe, or anything in between.In an unusual display of openness, IBM also will be helping customers tie together operations that include lots of equipment made by IBM's competitors
that "a lot of this is intentions. . . . We'll have to wait and see" how the plan develops
The announcements also should help IBM go on the offensive against Digital Equipment Corp. on the plant floor.While IBM has traditionally dominated the market for computers on the business side of manufacturing operations and has done well in the market for design tools, Digital has dominated computerized manufacturing
While IBM has traditionally dominated the market for computers on the business side of manufacturing operations and has done well in the market for design tools, Digital has dominated computerized manufacturing.Hewlett-Packard Co. also has begun to gain share in the whole computer-integrated-manufacturing arena
In addition, Hewlett-Packard, while a much smaller player, has made a big commitment to the sorts of industry standards that facilitate those hookups and could give IBM some problems.Both can be expected to go after the market aggressively: Gartner Group Inc., a research firm, estimated the Digital gets 30% of its revenue from the manufacturing market, and Hewlett-Packard gets 50%

In making polyethylene sheets out of plastic chips, for instance, a chip sometimes doesn't melt, gets caught in the machinery and creates a run in the sheets.That can be expensive, because the problem may not be noticed for a while, and the sheets are typically thrown away

Ford said yesterday it will halt imports of the Merkur Scorpio, a $28,000 luxury sedan built by Ford of Europe in West Germany.The cars are sold under a separate franchise with its own sign in front of Lincoln-Mercury dealers -- as opposed to new models such as Taurus or Escort, which are sold under existing Ford divisions
The move to halt imports kills the four-year-old Merkur brand in the U.S. market.It will continue to be sold in the European market
and Ford's trucks are losing ground to their GM rivals.This fall, Ford introduced only one new product: A restyled version of its hulking Lincoln Town Car luxury model
The demise of Merkur (pronounced mare-COOR) comes after a September in which 670 Merkur dealers managed to sell only 93 Scorpios.Total Merkur sales for the first nine months dropped 46% from a year ago to just 6,320 cars
Merkur isn't the only European luxury brand having problems in the U.S.The Japanese assault on the luxury market is rapidly overshadowing such European makes as Audi and Saab, which at least have clear brand images
which at least have clear brand images.Merkur, as an import on domestic car lots, suffered from the same sort of image confusion that is hobbling sales of imports at General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp
But the brand had trouble from the start.The first Merkur, the XR4Ti, went on sale in early 1985
The first Merkur, the XR4Ti, went on sale in early 1985.The sporty coupe foundered
In May 1987, Ford began importing the Scorpio sedan from West Germany to sell next to a redesigned XR4Ti in showrooms.Ford officials said they expected the two Merkurs would sell about 15,000 cars a year, and in 1988 they reached that goal, as sales hit 15,261 cars
It was downhill from there, however.One major factor was the decline of the dollar against the mark
One major factor was the decline of the dollar against the mark, which began less than a year after Merkur's 1985 launch.As the West German currency rose, so did Merkur prices
The Merkur cars also suffered from spotty quality, some dealers say. "It was like a comedy of errors," says Martin J. "Hoot" McInerney
Apparently, however, the improvement came too late.Last fall, Ford announced it would discontinue the XR4Ti in the U.S. at the end of the 1989 model year
Ford said then it would keep the Scorpio.This year, Scorpio sales plummeted

Separately, for the first nine months, Soo Line reported a loss of $398,000, or four cents a share, compared with net income of $12.5 million, or $1.32 a share, a year earlier.Revenue fell 5.8% to $407.9 million from $433.2 million

Golden Nugget Inc. reported a third-quarter net loss of $13.1 million, or 76 cents a share, based on 17.2 million common shares and dilutive equivalents outstanding.The results compare with a year-earlier net loss of $1.5 million, or seven cents a share, based on 20.3 million common and dilutive equivalents outstanding
Results for the latest quarter include nonoperating items of $23.9 million, versus $8.4 million a year earlier.Most of the expenses stem from the company's huge Mirage resort-casino scheduled to open next month along the Strip, and an April 1989 financing by units operating the downtown Golden Nugget property
For the nine months, Golden Nugget reported a net loss of $11.4 million, or 69 cents a share, based on 16.6 million common and dilutive equivalents outstanding.The year earlier, the company had a net loss of $4.3 million, or 20 cents a share, based on 21 million common shares and dilutive equivalents outstanding
The year earlier, the company had a net loss of $4.3 million, or 20 cents a share, based on 21 million common shares and dilutive equivalents outstanding.The 1988 results include a $10.7 million charge stemming from a litigation judgment
Separately, the casino operator said its board approved a plan to buy-back as many as three million common shares from time to time, either in the open market or through private transactions.An additional 299,000 shares are authorized for repurchase under an earlier stock buy-back program
John Uphoff, an analyst with Raymond James & Associates, said the results weren't surprising, and attributed the buy-back to management's confidence in the Mirage's ability to generate strong cash flow in 1990.Yesterday, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Golden Nugget common closed at $28.25, up $2
The company said Mr. Franco developed a plan to establish a business that might be competitive with Capital Holding Corp.

that he has been considering and discussing a number of possible business ventures, but that "nothing is at a mature stage." He said he "didn't argue with" the company's decision to seek his resignation because contemplating outside business ventures can distract an executive from performing his best "at the job he is paid to do

For the nine months, Los Angeles-based H. F. Ahmanson had profit of $128.1 million, or $1.29 a share, a 4.6% decline from earnings of $134.2 million in the year-ago nine months.the decline was attributable to a 79% reduction in net gains on loan sales this year
Great Western Financial said third-quarter profit rose slightly to $68.4 million, or 52 cents a share, from $67.9 million, or 53 cents a share, from a year ago.Great Western, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., is a financial services firm and parent to Great Western Bank, an S&L
Great Western said it had a sharp increase in margins in the recent third quarter.Margins are the difference between the yield on the company's earning assets and its own cost of funds
But a reduction in one-time gains on the sale of various assets and an increase in the company's provision for loan losses held down the earnings gain.Great Western's provision for loan losses was increased to $27.9 million for the recent quarter compared with $21.8 million a year ago
Net income rose to a record $155.3 million, or 83 cents a share, from $134.8 million, or 72 cents a share.Revenue fell to $1.04 billion from $1.07 billion
Analysts said the results were as expected, but several added that the earnings masked underlying weaknesses in several businesses. "The quality of earnings wasn't as high as I expected," said Eric Philo, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs & Co

The 23-5 vote clears the way for consideration on the House floor next week or the week after.Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, in a letter to the committee, warned that he would urge President Bush to veto the legislation if it passed Congress
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, in a letter to the committee, warned that he would urge President Bush to veto the legislation if it passed Congress.The Senate Commerce Committee already has approved similar legislation
On Monday, a letter from Mr. Skinner's deputy, Elaine Chao, said the administration opposed the legislation "in its present form." Some of the bill's supporters had taken heart from the fact that the letter wasn't signed by Mr. Skinner and that it didn't contain a veto threat
The stepped-up administration warnings annoyed some lawmakers, especially senior Republicans who supported the bill because they thought the Transportation Department favored it. "We backed this bill because we thought it would help Skinner," one Republican said, "and now we're out there dangling in the wind
Under the committee bill, the Transportation secretary would have 30 days, and an additional 20 days if needed, to review any proposed purchase of 15% or more of a major U.S. airline's voting stock.The secretary would be required to block an acquisition if he concluded that it would so weaken an airline financially that it would hurt safety or reduce the carrier's ability to compete, or if it gave control to a foreign interest
Although the legislation would apply to any acquisition of a major airline, it is aimed at transactions financed by large amounts of debt.an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures in order to repay debt
It became apparent in hearings that there ought to be regulation of leveraged buy-outs of some sort.in the airline business you can be totally laissez-faire because of the high degree of public interest" at stake
However, if the secretary concludes that a transaction has made a carrier unfit to operate, the department may revoke its certificate, grounding the airline.Such authority is more than adequate, say opponents of the legislation

The industry had shown signs of recovery this summer, after the central bank began to relax its clamp on credit, allowing interest rates to drop a bit after pushing them up for a year.Sales of new homes rose and inventories of houses, which had been climbing, dropped
Another reason for the weakness, he said, may be that mortgage rates have hit a plateau since they began edging down after a peak in March.In August, rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages started creeping up a bit, but they inched down again through September
Rates haven't really peeled off that much.We've kind of settled now into an interest-rate environment that's fairly high
Work was begun on single family homes -- the core of the housing market -- at an annual rate of 971,000 in September, a drop of 2.1% from the previous month.That followed a 3.3% decline in August

Some projections show Mexico importing crude by the end of the century, barring an overhaul of operations. "Whatever you tried to change, whether it was cutting costs or attracting new partners, the big obstacle was the old union leadership," says oil consultant George Baker

union perks had simply gotten out of hand.They are "at the base of all of the problems of corruption
The union also ceded the 2% commission it had received on all Pemex maintenance contracts. (The union will keep a 2% commission on construction projects
The new contract also eliminates the $15 monthly coupon.About 9,800 technical workers, notably chemists and lawyers, were switched to non-union status
Also, because of its reduced capital budget, Pemex has phased out about 50,000 transitory construction workers, reducing the work force to about 140,000.the union's sacrifices will be offset by a wage and benefit package that amounts to a 22% increase in compensation
But Pemex managers are the ones most thrilled by the contract. "We are retaking the instruments of administration
We are retaking the instruments of administration," says Raul Robles, a Pemex subdirector.Pemex officials wouldn't say how much money the new contract would save the company, but one previous government estimate pegged savings at around $500 million a year
Pemex's customers also are pleased with the company's new spirit.Grupo Desc, a big conglomerate, has long depended on Pemex petrochemicals to produce plastic packing material
it would never give notice to its customers. "The capriciousness would completely disrupt our operations
The capriciousness would completely disrupt our operations.This year, for the first time, Desc and other customers were consulted well in advance of the Pemex plant's shutdown to ensure minimal inconvenience
Taming the union complements previous moves by the government to attract private investment in petrochemicals.In May, the government unveiled new foreign investment regulations that create special trusts allowing foreigners, long limited to a 40% stake in secondary petrochemical companies, to own up to 100%
But Pemex's courtship with private companies, and especially foreign ones, is controversial in a country where oil has been a symbol of national sovereignty since foreign oil holdings were nationalized in 1938. "They are preparing the workers for what's coming: foreign control," wrote Heberto Castillo, a leftist leader
But the new union leader makes no apologies for Pemex's more outward-looking attitude. "If we do not integrate into this new world of interdependence, sooner or later we're going to become victims of our own isolation

Under the original buy-out approved by the UAL board Sept. 14, UAL's pilots planned to put up $200 million in cash and make $200 million in annual cost concessions for a 75% stake.UAL management was to pay $15 million for 10%, and British Air was to receive a 15% stake
The buy-out fell through when Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. unexpectedly failed to obtain bank financing.Since then, UAL stock has fallen 33% in what may rank as the largest collapse of a takeover stock ever
that British Air will take a more active, high-profile role in pursuing any new bid.He said he believes UAL management was badly advised on the funding of its original transaction
British Air hasn't received any new buy-out proposals from the labor-management group, led by UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf, and hasn't received any indication of when one might be forthcoming. "As far as we're concerned, we're waiting for the dust to settle
a revised transaction with less debt leverage is likely to be more attractive to banks.He said the original proposal is dead, and all aspects of a revised version are up for change, in light of the changes in UAL's market price, the amount of debt banks are willing to fund, and the price British Air would be willing to pay
but declined to specify a figure.Asked whether a $230-a-share figure circulating in the market yesterday is too low, he said, "It's certainly not too low
the original offer was "a pretty full price.with paying $750 million
If the {new} deal had us putting up less money but still having 15%, that would be a point in our favor," he said.In any new proposal, British Air would expect a greater rate of return than the 20%-plus in the original proposal
In the event that the buy-out group stalls in reviving its bid, the UAL board could remain under some pressure to seek another transaction, even without any legal obligation to do so.Roughly one-third of its stock is believed held by takeover stock traders, who could vote to oust the board if they become impatient
A pilot representing a group of 220 pilots hired during United's 1985 strike filed suit Friday in Chicago federal court to block the takeover.The dissident pilots oppose the plan because it would cause them to lose their seniority

In the last decade, many corporations have embraced the "utilization management" cost containment strategy as a way to control health-care costs for employees.These programs vary widely, but often require second opinions on proposed surgery, preadmission reviews of elective hospitalizations and reviews of treatment during illnesses or recovery periods
These programs vary widely, but often require second opinions on proposed surgery, preadmission reviews of elective hospitalizations and reviews of treatment during illnesses or recovery periods.Between 50% and 75% of today's workers are covered by such plans, up from 5% five years ago

Philippe Gras, a Renault managing director, said the new line will cover trucks of between 2.5 tons and 4.2 tons and will be built at Renault's Bapilly plant in France and at DAF's British plant.The French state-controlled auto group and the Dutch truck maker plan to incorporate the new trucks into their product lines when they begin production toward the middle of the 1990s
Mr. Gras said he expects a definitive agreement between the two companies to be completed in the next few months.The venture is the latest example of the trend toward cooperative projects in Europe ahead of the 1992 deadline for eliminating trade barriers within the European Community
the joint venture represents considerable savings for both Renault and DAF, since both companies would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles.By pooling their resources, the two groups have effectively halved the design and development costs that would otherwise have been entailed
Both Renault and DAF will have world-wide marketing rights for the new range of vans and light trucks.Under a separate arrangement, British Aerospace PLC's Rover Group PLC subsidiary will also be able to offer the vehicles through its dealers in the U.K., and Renault's truck-building subsidiary Renault Vehicles Industriels will have similar rights in France
DAF is 16%-owned by British Aerospace, with a further 6.5% held by the Dutch state-owned chemical group NV DSM.The van Doorne family of the Netherlands holds an additional 11% of DAF's capital
First, its position in the government is anomalous.It has an unusual kind of independence from elected officials and still has authority over one of the most powerful of government's instruments -- the control of the money supply
Thus we have a condition that is easily described as undemocratic.Second, the responsibilities of the Federal Reserve as guardian of the currency, which means as guardian of the stability of the price level, sometimes lead it to take measures that are unpopular
Second, the responsibilities of the Federal Reserve as guardian of the currency sometimes lead it to take measures that are unpopular.As former Fed Chairman William McChesney Martin used to say, they would have to take the punch bowl away just as the party is getting interesting
So the Federal Reserve is an attractive target for complaint by politicians.The Fed is easily assigned the blame for unpleasantness, like high interest rates or slow economic growth, while the politicians can escape responsibility by pointing to the Fed's independence
This leads to proposals for "reform" of the Fed.These proposals include changing the term of the chairman, shortening the terms of the members, eliminating the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks from the decision-making process, putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Federal Reserve Board, having the Fed audited by an arm of Congress (the General Accounting Office), putting the Fed's expenditures in the budget, and requiring prompt publication of the Fed's minutes
These proposals include changing the term of the chairman, shortening the terms of the members, eliminating the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks from the decision-making process, putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Federal Reserve Board, having the Fed audited by an arm of Congress (the General Accounting Office), putting the Fed's expenditures in the budget, and requiring prompt publication of the Fed's minutes.Some of these ideas are again under consideration in Congress
they rest on an incorrect view.They would not solve the problem
They would not solve the problem; they would make it worse
they would make it worse.The problem is not that the Fed is too unresponsive to the public interest
The price level in the U.S. is now about 4 1/4 times as high as it was 30 years ago.On average, something that cost $100 30 years ago now costs $425
Or, a wage that was $100 30 years ago would buy only $23.53 worth of stuff today.On two occasions the inflation rate rose to more than 10% a year
On two occasions the inflation rate rose to more than 10% a year.In each case the ending of this unsustainable inflation caused a severe recession -- the two worst of the postwar period
The enormous inflation over the past 30 years was largely due to monetary policy.At least, it would not have happened without the support of monetary policy that provided for a 10-fold increase in the money supply during the same period
Even where the Fed did not share this view it felt the need to accommodate to it.Despite all the formal provisions for its independence, the Fed seems constantly to feel that if it uses its independence too freely it will lose it
The common proposals for reforming the Fed would only make the situation worse, if they had any effect at all.Putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Board of Governors, one of the leading proposals today, is an example
Putting the Secretary of the Treasury on the Board of Governors, one of the leading proposals today, is an example.The secretary is the world's biggest borrower of money
The secretary is the world's biggest borrower of money.He has a built-in, constant longing for lower interest rates
Moreover, he is a political agent of a political president, who naturally gives extraordinary weight to the way the economy will perform before the next election, and less to its longer-run health.These days, the secretary suffers the further disqualification that he is a member of a club of seven finance ministers who meet occasionally to decide what exchange rates should be, which is a diversion from the real business of the Federal Reserve to stabilize the price level
True, a succession of Fed chairmen has given color to the notion that the Secretary of the Treasury belongs on the Fed.By their constant readiness to advise all and sundry about federal budgetary matters the chairmen have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are ingredients of a common stew, in which case it is natural that the Fed and the Treasury, and probably also the Congress, should be jointly engaged in stirring the pot
By their constant readiness to advise all and sundry about federal budgetary matters the chairmen have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are ingredients of a common stew.The Fed's case for its own independence would be a little stronger if it were more solicitous of the independence of the rest of the government
The Fed's problem is not that it is too independent, or too unpolitical.The Fed is responsive to, and cannot help being responsive to, the more overtly political part of the government
The Fed is responsive to, and cannot help being responsive to, the more overtly political part of the government.The Fed exercises a power given to it by Congress and the president
Critics of the present arrangement are correct to say that it is undemocratic.What is undemocratic is the unwillingness of the more political parts of the government to take the responsibility for deciding the basic question of monetary policy
What is undemocratic is the unwillingness of the more political parts of the government to take the responsibility for deciding the basic question of monetary policy, which is what priority should be given to stabilizing the price level.To leave this decision to an "independent" agency is not only undemocratic
The greatest contribution Congress could make at this time would be to declare that stabilizing the price level is the primary responsibility of the Federal Reserve System.Legislation to this effect has been introduced in Congress in this session by Rep. Stephen Neal (D., N.C.)
It is not the kind of thing that is likely to be enacted, however.Congress would be required to make a hard decision, and Congress would much prefer to leave the hard decision to the Fed and retain its rights of complaint after the fact
But that is not the same as saying that the Federal Reserve has other objectives.The government has other agencies and instruments for pursuing these other objectives

Strict new regulations seem certain to pass the state House in Pennsylvania next week.Legislation to require the consent of parents before their daughters under the age of 18 can have abortions will probably pass both houses of the Michigan legislature
Indeed, abortion-rights activists still face their greatest tests. "The pro-choice movement has shown -- finally -- that it can mobilize But it still hasn't shown that it can win in a state like Pennsylvania or Missouri, where abortion has been clearly an electoral issue and where it's been an emotional issue for a long time
The Freind legislation -- the state's House Judiciary Committee approved it in Harrisburg this week and the full Pennsylvania House is expected to take up the bill next Tuesday -- includes a provision to ban abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy, except to avert the death of the mother.Mr. Freind calculates that the provision, which attacks the trimester standards that Roe established, will "make it necessary" for the Supreme Court to review Roe and, perhaps, to overturn it
But the Pennsylvania measure also includes an "informed consent" provision.Under this legislation, a woman must be informed 24 hours before the operation of the details of the procedure and its risks
In Michigan, where the state Senate is expected to approve parental-consent legislation by the end of next week, Gov. Blanchard is the principal obstacle for anti-abortionists.Susan Rogin, a consultant to abortion-rights activists in the state, takes comfort from the fact that the state's House abortion opponents "haven't been able to muster the votes to overturn a veto on abortion in 16 years
In Illinois, lawmakers will vote before next spring on legislation requiring physicians to perform tests on fetuses at 20 weeks to determine their gestational age, weight and lung maturity along with a provision requiring that, if fetuses survive an abortion, a second doctor must be on hand to help it survive.The legislation failed by one vote to clear the House Rules Committee Tuesday, but anti-abortionists still may succeed in bringing the measure to the floor this fall

Abortion foes in Wisconsin, meanwhile, expect a parental-consent bill to be sent to the state assembly floor by early November and are hopeful of prevailing in both houses by next March.In Texas, abortion opponents want to pass parental-consent legislation along with a statewide ban on the use of public funds, personnel and facilities for abortion, and viability tests for fetuses 19 weeks and older
In Texas, abortion opponents want to pass parental-consent legislation along with a statewide ban on the use of public funds, personnel and facilities for abortion, and viability tests for fetuses 19 weeks and older.The anti-abortionists are urging GOP Gov. Bill Clements to press the issues in a special session scheduled to run Nov. 14 to Dec. 13
The prognosis is only fair.Next year is an election year and the legislators just don't want to do anything about this now

In a separate development, a private meeting is scheduled this morning between House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jamie Whitten (D., Miss.) and Sen. Dale Bumpers (D., Ark.) in an effort to end a dispute which for two weeks has delayed action on an estimated $44 billion agriculture bill.A House-Senate conference reached agreement Oct. 5 on virtually all major provisions of the bill, but final settlement has been stalled because of differences between the two men over the fate of a modest Arkansas-based program to provide technical information to farmers seeking to reduce their dependence on chemical fertilizers and pesticides
but Mr. Whitten has been adamant in insisting that the program be cut in 1990.The 79-year-old Mississippian takes a more orthodox, entrenched view of agriculture policy than those in the movement to reduce chemical use, but as a master of pork-barrel politics, he is believed to be annoyed as well that the project moved to Arkansas from a Tennessee center near Memphis and the northern Mississippi border
The British conglomerate, planning its own defensive restructuring to fight off a #13.35 billion ($21.03 billion) takeover bid by Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith, intends to press ahead with an extraordinary shareholder vote today to clear the way for its value-boosting measures.If anything, the gyrations in world stock markets since last Friday's sharp Wall Street sell-off have increased the likelihood of shareholder approval for the restructuring

Investors in B.A.T have been on a roller coaster.B.A.T has been London's best-performing blue chip over the past six months, up 40% against a 4% rise in the Financial Times 100-Share Index.But this week, B.A.T has been hit harder than other big U.K. stocks
But this week, B.A.T has been hit harder than other big U.K. stocks.B.A.T rose five pence (eight cents) to 756 pence ($11.91) in London yesterday as a late market rally erased a 28-pence fall earlier in the day
To fight off predators, B.A.T plans to spin off about $6 billion in assets, largely by selling such U.S. retailing units as Marshall Field and Saks and by floating its big paper and U.K. retailing business via share issues to existing holders.Proceeds will help pay for a planned buy-back of 10% of its shares and a 50% dividend increase

Among possible delays, the sales of Saks and Marshall Field -- which were expected to be on the block soon after the crucial Christmas season -- may slide into the second quarter or second half.Analysts estimate that sales of the two businesses could raise roughly $2 billion
possible acquirers for the units include managers from both retailing chains, and General Cinema Corp.Other potential bidders for parts of B.A.T's U.S. retail unit include Dillard Department Stores Inc., May Department Stores Co. and Limited Inc

Whitbread already has been approached by "about half a dozen" companies interested in buying all or part of the spirits business.the spirits operations and some California vineyards that also are being sold to fetch about #500 million ($788.8 million
Beefeater alone is worth as much as #300 million.Whitbread bought the Beefeater distillery two years ago for #174.5 million
But Whitbread has been squeezed by giant rivals amid widespread consolidation in the industry.Now, it wants to concentrate on beer and its newer hotel and restaurant operations
For rival liquor companies, the Whitbread auction is a rare opportunity to acquire valuable brands. "It's not very often something like this comes up

As you mentioned, subsidies for development on a number of barrier islands were curtailed in 1982 by the Coastal Barrier Resource System.The National Taxpayers Union would like Congress to add 800,000 acres to the 453,000 of shoreline in the system by enacting "The Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1989
This bill simply says that if you want to develop property on a barrier island you have to do so without taxpayer support.Private-property rights would be upheld because the legislation would not ban coastal development
A Taxpayers Union study concluded the bill would save taxpayers up to $9.3 billion in barrier-island subsidies over 20 years.Already, the 1982 legislation has saved an estimated $800 million

Some 17.2% of all money income received by families in 1988 went to the wealthiest 5% of all families, up from 16.9% in 1987.That is the greatest share reported for any year since 1950, although changing definitions over the years distort the comparison
The top fifth of all families got 44% of the income, up from 41.5% a decade earlier.The bottom fifth of all families got 4.6% of the income, down from 5.2% a decade earlier

its figures would look far rosier if it recalculated the poverty threshold using an improved consumer-price measure adopted in 1983.some 3.5 million fewer people would have fallen below the poverty line in 1988 -- and the poverty rate would have been 10.5% instead of 13.1% -- under the alternative calculation
Critics on the left and right have been calling for all sorts of revisions to the measure for years.A report by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress released yesterday concluded, "It is misleading to make this change without adjusting for other changes

In February 1987, Bally thwarted a possible hostile takeover bid from Mr. Trump by agreeing to buy 2.6 million of Mr. Trump's 3.1 million Bally shares for $83.7 million -- more than $18 million above market price.The term greenmail refers to a situation where a company pays a premium over market value to repurchase a stake held by a potential acquirer
The amount Bally and Mr. Trump will pay to settle the class-action suit pales in comparison to the $45 million Walt Disney Co. and Saul Steinberg's Reliance Group Holdings Inc. agreed to pay to settle a similar suit in July.That settlement represented the first time shareholders were granted a major payment in a greenmail case

When Disney offered to pay Mr. Steinberg a premium for his shares, the New York investor didn't demand the company also pay a premium to other shareholders.When Mr. Trump sued Bally, he sued only on behalf of himself
Mr. Trump and Bally also appeared to have some leverage in the case because in the state of Delaware, where Bally is incorporated, courts have held that greenmail is often protected by the business-judgment rule.That rule gives boards of directors wide latitude in deciding how to deal with dissident shareholders
Seventeen articles of impeachment against the Florida judge, one of the few blacks on the U.S. bench, were approved by the House in August 1988.The central charge against Judge Hastings is that he conspired with a Washington lawyer to obtain a $150,000 bribe from defendants in a criminal case before the judge, in return for leniency
The Senate's public gallery was packed with Judge Hastings' supporters, who erupted into applause after he finished his argument.Judge Hastings, who was acquitted of similar charges by a federal jury in 1983, claims he is being victimized and that the impeachment proceedings against him constitute double jeopardy
and is scheduled to vote on the impeachment tomorrow.If the judge is impeached, as is thought likely, he will be removed from office immediately

Under the proposed agreement involving the world's tallest building, Chicago-based Sears would receive about half the money through conventional mortgage financing and the other half as a convertible mortgage.At the end of the term of the convertible loan, Sears could still own half the building, and AEW could own the other half
At the end of the term of the convertible loan, Sears could still own half the building, and AEW could own the other half.Neither side would comment
The parties are currently negotiating over who would manage the building, which will be emptied of 6,000 employees from Sears' merchandise group, which is moving elsewhere.The new manager will face the daunting task of leasing 1.8 million square feet in a relatively soft Chicago real estate market
Convertible mortgages have become an increasingly popular way to finance prestigious buildings of late.In a convertible mortgage, the investor lends the building owner a certain amount in return for the option to convert its interest into equity, usually less than 50%, at the end of the loan term
In a convertible mortgage, the investor lends the building owner a certain amount in return for the option to convert its interest into equity, usually less than 50%, at the end of the loan term.During the term, the lender can either receive a percentage of cash flow, a percentage of the building's appreciation or a fixed return
During the term, the lender can either receive a percentage of cash flow, a percentage of the building's appreciation or a fixed return.The main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does not trigger costly transfer taxes and reappraisal
Sears then went back to AEW, the Boston pension adviser that had proposed a convertible debt deal during the first round of bids last spring.AEW has $3.5 billion of real estate investments nationwide, according to a spokesman
Tandy Corp. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire two units of Datatronic AB of Stockholm for cash.The amount wasn't disclosed
Wall Street is seething over the rules.The provisions could further cool the takeover boom that has been the driving force behind the bull market in stocks for much of the 1980s
At issue is the deductibility of certain junk bonds that are used in most LBOs.Such high-yield debt is similar to a zero-coupon bond in that it is sold at a discount to face value, with interest accruing instead of being paid to the holder
Such high-yield debt is similar to a zero-coupon bond in that it is sold at a discount to face value, with interest accruing instead of being paid to the holder.Under current rules, that accrued interest is deductible by the company issuing the debt
The House version of the legislation would kill that deduction, and label any such debt as equity, which isn't deductible.The less-rigorous Senate version would defer the deductibility for roughly five years
You see these in just about every LBO.It becomes a source of cash" for the company making the LBO because it gets a deduction and doesn't have to repay the debt for several years
Typically, Mr. Willens estimates, this type of debt makes up 15% to 20% of the financing for LBOs.These types of bonds have been used in buy-outs of companies such as RJR Nabisco Inc., Storer Communications Inc. and Kroger Co
But that rule is being virtually overlooked by Wall Street, which is concentrating on coping with the deduction issue. "Prices for LBOs have to come down if you don't have that feature

his firm didn't raise the ante for a target company earlier this month after a stronger bid emerged from a public company that wasn't concerned about the financing provision. "We would have paid more if we thought that law wasn't going to pass
One possible solution for Wall Street is to increase the equity part of the transaction -- that is, give lenders a bigger stake in the surviving company rather than just interest payments.That would force the buy-out firm and the target company's management to reduce their level of ownership
That would force the buy-out firm and the target company's management to reduce their level of ownership. "The pigs in the trough may have to give a little bit of the slop back and then the deal can go through
Another solution is for firms to use convertible bonds that sell at a discount.they wouldn't fall under the junk-bond category that would lose its deductibility
that would lose its deductibility.The House version of the bill would make debt non-deductible if it pays five percentage points above Treasury notes, has at least a five-year maturity and doesn't pay interest for at least one year out of the first five
The House version of the bill would make debt non-deductible if it pays five percentage points above Treasury notes, has at least a five-year maturity and doesn't pay interest for at least one year out of the first five.The bill would then declare that the debt is equity and therefore isn't deductible.The Senate bill would only deny the deduction until interest is actually paid
that its version of the provision would yield $17 million the first year and a total of $409 million over five years.The House version would raise slightly more
a Senate aide contends LBOs will become somewhat more difficult. "There's no question it will make LBOs more expensive," he said

President Bush signed a disaster declaration covering seven Northern California counties.The declaration immediately made the counties eligible for temporary housing, grants and low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses
In addition, an unusually wide array of federal agencies moved to provide specialized assistance.The Department of Housing and Urban Development prepared to make as many as 100 vacant houses available for those left homeless, the Agriculture Department was set to divert food from the school-lunch program to earthquake victims, and the Pentagon was providing everything from radio communications to blood transfusions to military police for directing traffic
But the pool of federal emergency-relief funds already is running low because of the heavy costs of cleaning up Hurricane Hugo, and Congress will be under pressure to allocate more money quickly.In Hugo's wake, Congress allocated $1.1 billion in relief funds
Now, though, enormous costs for earthquake relief will pile on top of outstanding costs for hurricane relief. "That obviously means that we won't have enough for all of the emergencies that are now facing us
That obviously means that we won't have enough for all of the emergencies that are now facing us, and we will have to consider appropriate requests for follow-on funding.The federal government isn't even attempting yet to estimate how much the earthquake will cost it
In Congress, lawmakers already are looking for ways to add relief funds.Money could be added to a pending spending bill covering the Federal Emergency Management Agency
Money could be added to a pending spending bill covering the Federal Emergency Management Agency.More likely, relief funds could be added to an omnibus spending bill that Congress is to begin considering next week

HUD officials said they will make available as many as 100 Bay area houses that are under HUD loans but now are vacant after the houses have been inspected to ensure they are sound.Additional housing vouchers and certificates will be made available, officials said, and some housing and community-development funds may be shifted from other programs or made available for emergency use
Another federal agency not normally associated with disaster relief moved quickly as well.it will waive certain tax penalties for earthquake victims unable to meet return deadlines or make payments because of the quake's devastation
The IRS said it will waive certain tax penalties for earthquake victims unable to meet return deadlines or make payments because of the quake's devastation.The agency plans to announce specific relief procedures in the coming days
One advantage that federal officials have in handling earthquake relief is the large number of military facilities in the San Francisco Bay area.Even before the full extent of the devastation was known, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered the military services to set up an emergency command center in the Pentagon and prepare to respond to various FEMA requests for assistance
By yesterday afternoon, Air Force transport planes began moving additional rescue and medical supplies, physicians, communications equipment and FEMA personnel to California.A military jet flew a congressional delegation and senior Bush administration officials to survey the damage
To help residents in Northern California rebuild, FEMA intends to set up 17 disaster assistance offices in the earthquake area in the next several days and to staff them with 400 to 500 workers from various agencies, said Robert Volland, chief of the agency's individual assistance division.At these offices, earthquake victims will be helped in filling out a one-page form that they will need to qualify for such federal assistance as home-improvement loans and to repair houses
And federal officials are promising to move rapidly with federal highway aid to rebuild the area's severely damaged road system.The Federal Highway Administration has an emergency relief program to help states and local governments repair federally funded highways and bridges seriously damaged by natural disasters

His company, Misa Manufacturing Inc., was forced to seek protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law in 1987 and has since been liquidated.Monthly sales of his Egg King machine have sunk to about half a dozen from a peak of 75
Now one might ask why people who sell eggs would fight someone who is trying to make it easier to crack them.Part of the answer lies in the nature of the industry
Part of the answer lies in the nature of the industry.Many larger egg producers are also egg processors, who crack, inspect, and sanitize billions of eggs, turning them into powdered, liquified or frozen egg products
One Egg King -- which at just under four feet tall and two feet wide has been likened to the robot R2-D2 -- can crack about 20,000 eggs an hour.Because fresh eggs are less expensive than processed ones, a big egg user can recover the Egg King's $3,390 cost in a few months, says Mr. Maynard
nobody else was offering them in the U.S.The main reason: salmonella
Chickens carry this bacteria.Hens sometimes pass salmonella to the eggs, and it can also be found on unclean shells
Mr. Maynard claims this is a manageable problem.The Egg King carries written instructions to break only high-grade eggs that have been properly sanitized and, as an added precaution, to use the eggs only in products that will be cooked enough to kill bacteria
The Egg King carries written instructions to break only high-grade eggs that have been properly sanitized and, as an added precaution, to use the eggs only in products that will be cooked enough to kill bacteria.With nearly 4,000 machines in use, there have been no salmonella problems as long as instructions were followed
Opponents don't buy such arguments. "Human nature being what it is, people don't always follow instructions

An early battleground was the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Mr. Maynard initially won approval for his machine to be used at egg-processing facilities regulated by the USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service
Mr. Maynard initially won approval for his machine to be used at egg-processing facilities regulated by the USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service.Unfortunately for Mr. Maynard, another branch of the USDA, the Agricultural Marketing Service, was in charge of eggs
Unfortunately for Mr. Maynard, another branch of the USDA, the Agricultural Marketing Service, was in charge of eggs.After receiving complaints from egg producers, this branch got the other branch to rescind its approval, thus limiting the machine's potential market to bakeries and restaurants and other establishments that aren't regulated by the USDA
So the producers went to Capitol Hill, where a congressman from Georgia introduced a measure to ban centrifugal egg-breaking machines.Mr. Maynard enlisted his local congressman
Mr. Maynard's forces finally defeated the measure, though it took a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives to do it.Even then, opponents managed to get a congressional hearing to examine what one congressman called an "unscrupulous" method for breaking eggs
Foiled in their effort to get a national ban, the egg producers turned their attention to the states.So far, New York, New Jersey, Nebraska, Georgia, Michigan and Minnesota have outlawed Mr. Maynard's device, citing health concerns
An antitrust suit that Mr. Maynard's company filed in Los Angeles federal court against the United Egg Producers and others only added to the entrepreneur's woes.The judge dismissed the suit and ordered Mr. Maynard's company to pay over $100,000 in legal fees to the defendants' lawyers

As the tough, slinky lounge chanteuse in "The Fabulous Baker Boys," Ms. Pfeiffer sings for herself, and more than passably well.Her Susie Diamond handles a song the way the greats do, like she's hearing the way it should sound inside her head and she's concentrating on matching that internal tone
Yet her intensity stops and starts with the music.When she isn't performing for an audience, she prepares for a song by removing the wad of gum from her mouth, and indicates that she's finished by sticking the gum back in
Steve Kloves, the young writer and director (he isn't yet 30), has only one produced picture to his credit; he wrote the screenplay for "Racing With the Moon," a lovely coming-of-age picture set in the '40s

However, Mr. Kloves directs his own material without sentimentality and at its own eccentric pace; "Baker Boys" is both bluesy and funny
Much of the picture's sensuality emerges from cinematographer Michael Ballhaus's slyly seductive lens work.After working for years with Werner Rainer Fassbinder, the late German director, and more recently with Martin Scorsese ("After Hours," "The Color of Money," "The Last Temptation of Christ"), Mr. Ballhaus has developed a distinctively fluid style

Money-fund assets have been rising at an average rate of $1.6 billion a week in recent months.In the latest week, funds open to institutions alone grew by $1.8 billion
Some fund managers say inflows could increase in coming days as a result of stock selling in the wake of Friday's 190.58point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. "If you're selling equities, you don't start getting proceeds for five to seven days," said Frank Rachwalski, who manages the Kemper Money Market Fund
inflows Friday into Fidelity's Spartan and Cash Reserves money-market funds were about twice normal levels.Monday and Tuesday "were lackluster in comparison
People aren't necessarily running scared.They're maintaining their attitude toward investing, which has leaned toward the conservative recently
Money-fund yields tend to lag interestrate trends as portfolio managers adjust the maturities of their investments -- short-term Treasury securities, commercial paper and the like -- to capture the highest yields.Maturities usually are shorter when rates are rising and longer when they are falling
The average maturity of the funds tracked by IBC/Donoghue's remained at 38 days for the third consecutive week.It was as short as 29 days at the start of this year, when rates were marching steadily upward, and hit 42 days in August
The average seven-day simple yield of the funds fell to 8.21% this week from 8.26%.The average 30-day simple yield was 8.26%, compared with 8.27% the week before, and the 30-day compound yield slid to 8.60% from 8.61%

It also creates a newly merged world-wide ad agency controlled by Eurocom and headed jointly by New York ad man Jerry Della Femina and two top WCRS executives.The merged agency's admittedly ambitious goal: to become one of the world's 10 largest agencies, while attracting more multinational clients than the agencies were able to attract alone
The transaction places the three executives squarely at the helm of a major agency with the rather unwieldy name of Eurocom WCRS Della Femina Ball Ltd., or EWDB.The merged agency will include Della Femina McNamee based in New York, Eurocom's various agencies in France, the Belier Group in Europe and WCRS's other advertising and direct marketing operations
Mr. Della Femina will be joint chairman with former WCRS executive Robin Wight.Both will report to Tim Breene, a former WCRS executive who will be chief executive officer at the new agency
In an interview in New York, Mr. Breene outlined big plans for the new agency. "Our goal is to develop quite rapidly to a top-10 position . . . by the end of three years from now

The merged company that it now becomes part of will have billings of just more than $2.6 billion -- most of that in Europe -- bringing it to about 14th world-wide.To make it to top-10 status, it would have to leapfrog over such formidable forces as Grey Advertising, D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles and Omnicom's DDB Needham
The merged agency's game plan to attract multinational packaged-goods advertisers may prove equally difficult.When WCRS created Della Femina McNamee out of the merger of three smaller agency units in 1988, it said it did so in order to attract larger clients, especially packaged-goods companies

's Saran Wrap
But major packaged-goods players of the world -- such as Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive and Unilever -- have steadfastly eluded the agency. "Three of our favorite names
Still, the restructuring could create one of the most powerful alliances between advertising and media-buying firms that Europe has seen.As part of the restructuring, WCRS and Eurocom said they will look for ways to combine their media buying across Europe
What's more, both Eurocom and brothers Francis and Gilbert Gross, who founded Carat, will acquire 14.99% stakes in WCRS Group.Carat will receive its WCRS stake as part of payment for the 50% Carat stake that WCRS is buying

In addition to Carat, WCRS will hold onto its public relations, TV programming and other businesses.WCRS says its debt will be cut to #24 million from #66 million as a result of the transaction

As if this weren't enough, the Senate Judiciary Committee is getting into the act.On Tuesday it approved Senator Bob Dole's proposed commemorative resolution designating April 24, 1990, as the "National Day of Remembrance of the 75th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide of 1915-1923

The rubble after the Armenian earthquake a year ago disclosed, quite literally, a city whose larger structures had been built with sand.The extent of the disaster stemmed from years of chicanery and bureaucratic indifference

The eerie complacency of the Reagan-Bush era has produced Panglossian paeans about the present perfection of U.S. economic and social arrangements.A licensed government intellectual, Francis Fukuyama, recently announced in The National Interest that history is, so to speak, at an end since the course of human progress has now culminated in the glorious full stop of American civilization
A licensed government intellectual, Francis Fukuyama, recently announced in The National Interest that history is, so to speak, at an end since the course of human progress has now culminated in the glorious full stop of American civilization.His observations were taken seriously
The financial equivalent of the sand used by those Armenian contractors is junk bonds and the leveraged buy-outs associated with them.Builders get away with using sand and financiers junk when society decides it's okay, necessary even, to look the other way
Government statistics in fact show that the profit rate peaked in 1965 at 17.2%.That same calculation saw profit rates fall to 4.6% in the recession year 1982 and the supposed miracle that followed has seen the profit rate rise only to 8.1% in 1986 and 8% in 1987
Corresponding to the fall in profit rates was -- in the early 1980s -- the drop in the number arrived at if you divide the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets, the famous Q ratio associated with Prof.James Tobin.In theory, the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same
This is indeed what the market decided.By 1982 the ratio was 43.5%, meaning that the market was valuing every dollar's worth of the average firm's assets at 43 cents
that if it takes only 43 cents to buy a dollar's worth of a firm's capital stock, an alert entrepreneur won't look the other way.His assumption is that the underlying profitability rate will go up and the capital assets he bought on the cheap will soon be producing profits
But here is where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet, and where society was maybe foolish to look the other way.The profit rate is still low and the Q ratio was only 65% in 1987 and 68.9% in 1988
The profit rate is still low and the Q ratio was only 65% in 1987 and 68.9% in 1988.Result: a landscape littered with lemons, huge debt burdens crushing down upon the arch and spans of corporate America
But there were enough promoters announcing the end of history for society to continue shielding its eyes.Mainstream economists and commentators, craning their necks up at the great pyramids of junk financing, swiveling their heads to watch the avalanche of leveraged buy-outs, claimed the end result would be a leaner, meaner corporate America, with soaring productivity and profits and the weaker gone to the wall
But this is not where the rewards of junk financing were found.The beneficiaries were those financiers whose icon was the topic figure of '80s capitalism
Left-stream economists I associate with were not hypnotized in the manner of their pliant colleagues.All along they have been noting the tremors and pointing out the underlying realities
and pointing out the underlying realities.Profit rates after the great merger wave are no higher, and now we have an extremely high-interest burden relative to cash flow
The consequences of building empires with sand are showing up.In contrast to previous estimates reckoning the default rate on junk bonds at 2% or 3%, a Harvard study published in April of this year found the default rate on these junk bonds is 34%
Corporations need liquidity, in the form of borrowed funds.Without liquidity from the junk-bond market or cash flow from profits, they look to the government
which obediently assists the natural motions of the capitalist economy with charity in the form of cuts in the capital-gains tax rate or bailouts.The consequence can be inflation, brought on as the effect of a desperate bid to avoid the deflationary shock of a sudden crash
Attacks on inflation come with another strategy of capital of a very traditional sort: an assault on wages.Mr. Fukuyama said in his essay that "the class issue has actually been successfully resolved in the West
Mr. Fukuyama might want to consult some American workers on the subject of class and egalitarianism.From its peak in 1972 of $198.41, the average American weekly wage had fallen to $169.28 in 1987 -- both figures being expressed in 1977 dollars

The decision, which affects millions of dollars of trading positions, was made late yesterday because the Pacific exchange's options floor was shut down as a result of Tuesday's earthquake.it was necessary to ensure that options listed on the exchange could be traded today and tomorrow
well over 50 traders from the Pacific exchange were taking flights from San Francisco late yesterday to the American, New York and Philadelphia exchanges and to the CBOE.carpenters quickly erected a new options floor to accomodate 40 traders from the Pacific exchange

Even as the stock market has generally done well this year, IBM's shares have slipped steadily from its 52-week high of $130.875.Yesterday's closing price of $101.75, down 50 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, puts the stock at about 1 1/2 times book value, which is as low as it has sunk over the past decade
The move by IBM wasn't exactly a surprise.The company has spent some $5 billion over the past 3 1/2 years to buy back 42 million common shares, or roughly 7% of those outstanding
In addition, despite IBM's well-publicized recent problems, the computer giant still generates enormous amounts of cash.As of the end of the second quarter, it had $4.47 billion of cash and marketable securities on hand
In the short term, the move is likely to have little effect.At yesterday's closing price, $1 billion would buy back about 10 million shares, or less than 2% of the roughly 580 million outstanding
None of the problems is necessarily fatal, and they aren't all necessarily even related.There are also other factors at work that are outside IBM's control, such as currency exchange rates

Clearly, people like Mrs. Lombardi are giving marketers fits.She represents a new breed of savvy consumer who puts bargain prices, nutritional and environmental concerns, and other priorities ahead of old-fashioned brand loyalty

The Wall Street Journal's "American Way of Buying" survey this year found that most consumers switch brands for many of the products they use.For the survey, Peter D.

When there's a clutter of brands, consumers simplify the complexity by telling themselves, 'All brands are the same so what difference does it make which I buy.Too often, advertising imagery hasn't done a good job of forging a special emotional bond between a brand and the consumer
And perhaps with good reason.Every time 24 hours pass without any advertising reinforcement, brand loyalty will diminish ever so slightly -- even for a powerful brand like Budweiser
Consider, for example, what happened to Maxwell House coffee.The Kraft General Foods brand stopped advertising for about a year in 1987 and gave up several market share points and its leadership position in the coffee business

Getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after Hurricane Hugo ripped through the Caribbean and the Carolinas last month.The earthquake's toll, including possible deep structural damage, goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane
But investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake, coming so soon after the hurricane, will help stem more than two years of intense price-cutting wars among business insurers.Reflecting that logic, insurance-company stocks posted strong gains
Aetna and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects to help them assess structural damage.Most insurers already have mobilized their "catastrophe" teams to begin processing claims from their policyholders in northern California
Since commercial air travel is interrupted, Aetna, based in Hartford, Conn., chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into Sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the Bay area.About 25 adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon, along with laptop computers, cellular phones and blank checks

Officials from the American Insurance Association's property-claim service division, which coordinates the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster, will be flying to San Francisco today.They expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two
Roads and bridges in the Bay area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage.Highways generally don't have insurance coverage
Highways, such as the section of Interstate 880 that collapsed in Oakland, generally don't have insurance coverage.the Bay Bridge has no earthquake coverage, either
However, the bridge, which charges a $1 toll each way, does have "loss of income" insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days.That coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including Fireman's Fund Corp., based in Novato, Calif., and Cigna Corp., based in Philadelphia
For example, insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy.Such increased demand for reinsurance, along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters, are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise

The deal would require approval by a majority of Jaguar shareholders. "We have to make it attractive enough that {holders} would accept it
That may be difficult when you have somebody else breathing down your neck." Ford probably would try to kill the proposal by enlisting support from U.S. takeover-stock speculators and holding out the carrot of a larger bid later, said
until U.K. government restrictions expire.The anti-takeover measure prevents any outside investor from buying more than 15% of Jaguar shares without permission until Dec. 31, 1990
But with its 10.4% stake, Ford can convene a special Jaguar shareholders' meeting and urge them to drop the restrictions prematurely. "It's a very valuable weapon in their armory," which could enable Ford to bid sooner for Jaguar

The Wall Street Journal "American Way of Buying" Survey consists of two separate, door-to-door nationwide polls conducted for the Journal by Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Roper Organization.The two surveys, which asked different questions, were conducted using national random probability samples

They accounted for a hefty 16% of New York Stock Exchange volume Monday, the fourth busiest session ever.On Friday, 13% of volume was in computer-guided program trades
But as the outcry faded by the spring of 1988, they resumed.Some observers thought that after Friday's sharp drop, the firms would rein in their program traders to avoid stoking more controversy
But the statistics released yesterday show the firms did nothing of the sort.One reason was that the official reports on the 1987 crash exonerated program trading as a cause
Stock-index arbitrage is the most controversial form of program trading because it accelerates market moves, if not actually causing them.In it, traders buy or sell stocks and offset those positions in stock-index futures contracts to profit from fleeting price discrepancies
In it, traders buy or sell stocks and offset those positions in stock-index futures contracts to profit from fleeting price discrepancies.Under the exchange's definitions, program trading also describes a number of other strategies that, in the opinion of some traders, don't cause big swings in the market

Though it collects such data daily, its monthly reports on program trading usually come out about three weeks after each month ends.The September figures are due to be released this week
Though brokerage officials defended their use of program trading, one sign of what an issue it remains was that few executives would comment on the record.Besides reciting the pardon for program trading contained in the Brady Commission report, they said stock-index arbitrage was actually needed Monday to restore the markets' equilibrium
On Friday, the stock-index futures market was unhinged from the stock market when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange halted trading in Standard & Poor's 500 futures contract.Futures trading resumed a half-hour later, but the session ended shortly thereafter, leaving the stock market set up for more sell programs, traders said

In July, Moody's downgraded $400 million of the company's debt, saying the bank holding company hadn't taken adequate write-offs against potential losses on real estate loans despite its second-quarter write-down.Richard M. Greenwood, Valley National's executive vice president, said then that the company believed the write-downs were "adequate" and didn't plan to increase its reserves again
Valley National "isn't out of the woods yet." The key will be whether Arizona real estate turns around or at least stabilizes

the reaction from individual investors this week has been almost eerie.Customers and potential customers are suddenly complaining about the stock market in the exact way they did in post-crash 1987
The kinds of questions you had before have resurfaced.I can just tell the questions are right back where they were: `What's going on?,' `Can't anything be done about program trading?,' `Doesn't the exchange understand?,' `Where is the SEC on this

But "these wide swings scare them to death." All of this is bad news for the big brokerage firms such as Shearson and Merrill Lynch & Co. that have big "retail," or individual-investor, businesses.After expanding rapidly during the bull-market years up to the 1987 crash, retail brokerage operations these days are getting barely enough business to pay the overhead
But those dollars have been going into such "safe" products as money market funds.At discount brokerage Charles Schwab & Co., such "cash-equivalent" investments recently accounted for a record $8 billion of the firm's $25 billion of client's assets
A slightly higher percentage of New York Stock Exchange volume has been attributed to retail investors in recent months compared with post-crash 1988, according to Securities Industry Association data.In 1987, an average 19.7% of Big Board volume was retail business, with the monthly level never more than 21.4%

He gave 10-to-1 odds that a capital-gains tax cut of some sort would be approved this year, though it probably won't be included in the pending deficit-reduction bill.He added that he expects to talk to the Democrats who also wanted to cut the gains tax about drafting a joint proposal
For individuals, the Packwood plan would exclude from income 5% of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year.The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of 35%
The exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of 35%.The exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1, 1989
For corporations, the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33% from the current top rate of 34%.That rate would gradually decline to as little as 29% for corporate assets held for 15 years
The Packwood plan would also include a proposal, designed by Sen. William Roth (R., Del.), that would expand and alter the deduction for individual retirement accounts.The Roth plan would create a new, non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement, but also for the purchase of a first home and to pay education and medical expenses

But this quake wasn't the big one, the replay of 1906 that has been feared for so many years.Despite the tragic loss of more than 270 lives, and damage estimated in the billions, most businesses and their plants and offices in the Bay area weren't greatly affected
The economic life of the region is expected to revive in a day or two, although some transportation problems may last weeks or months.A main factor mitigating more widespread damage was the location of the quake's epicenter -- 20 miles from the heart of the Silicon Valley and more than 50 miles from downtown San Francisco and Oakland
Of course, the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned Silicon Valley into the nation's capital of high technology.Like other major American cities, the San Francisco -- Oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of fiber-optic cables linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location astride one of the world's great natural harbors
When the tremors struck, the region's largely unseen high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air.nearly all the network's computer switches, which move thousands of calls a minute from one location to another, changed to battery power when the city lost power

The economic dislocation was as abrupt as the earthquake itself, as virtually all businesses shut down.The $125-billion-a-year Bay area economy represents one-fourth of the economy of the nation's most populous state and accounts for 2% to 3% of the nation's total output of goods and services, according to the Center for Continuing Study of the California Economy in Palo Alto

There will be a big influx of federal dollars and gains in state, federal and local employment," Ms. Mace says.Adds Stacy Kotman, an economist at Georgia State University, "There's nothing positive about an earthquake, but it will probably generate more construction activity."
Wall Street reacted swiftly yesterday to the disaster by bidding up stocks of construction and related companies.Shares of Lone Star Industries Inc., a cement maker, rose sharply in anticipation of stepped-up demand
Shares of Lone Star Industries Inc., a cement maker, rose sharply in anticipation of stepped-up demand.In Greenwich, Conn., Lone Star spokesman Michael London says, "Obviously with an earthquake of this size, there are likely to be construction projects that wouldn't otherwise have been anticipated

Mr. Byrne says Fireman's Fund will probably pay hundreds of millions in primary claims, but, after taxes and use of its reinsurance lines, the company's fourthquarter charge against earnings shouldn't top $50 million.The company was able to assess its damage liability quickly because it has computerized maps of Northern California showing the exact locations of all the property it insures

but its terrible fist struck here on the Nimitz Freeway.Along the way, the quake toppled a mall in Santa Cruz, knocked down buildings in San Francisco's fashionable Marina District and sent a wall of bricks crashing on motorists in the city's Financial District
A four-square-block area of the Marina District lies smoldering under a steady stream of seawater being pumped onto rubble to prevent it from blazing anew.Many of the buildings, mostly condominiums and apartments, were flattened almost instantly

For the Politburo replaced Mr. Honecker with a man cut of the same cloth: Egon Krenz, the most recent internal-security chief and a longtime Honecker protege.East Germany, it is clear, is no Poland, where the Communist Party now shares power with the democratically elected Solidarity union
Still, any change in East Germany has enormous implications, for both East and West.It raises the long-cherished hopes of many Germans for reunification -- a prospect that almost equally alarms political leaders in Moscow, Washington and Western Europe
Mr. Krenz, 52, was named the new party chief just minutes after the Party's 163-member Central Committee convened in East Berlin.Although the East German news agency ADN claimed Mr. Honecker had asked to be relieved of his duties for "health reasons," West German government sources said the 26-man Politburo had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late Tuesday
Although the East German news agency ADN claimed Mr. Honecker had asked to be relieved of his duties for "health reasons," West German government sources said the 26-man Politburo had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late Tuesday. (Mr.Honecker was twice hospitalized this summer for a gall bladder ailment and his physical condition has been the subject of intense speculation in the Western media
ADN said Mr. Honecker, a hard-line Stalinist who in 1961 supervised the construction of the Berlin Wall, also was relieved of his title as head of state and his position as chief of the military.Mr. Krenz is expected to be formally named to all three positions once the nation's parliament convenes later this week
during which Mr. Honecker, now 77 years old, built East Germany into the most economically advanced nation in the Soviet bloc.His grip on power unraveled this summer as thousands of his countrymen, dissatisfied by the harshness of his rule, fled to the West
as thousands of his countrymen, dissatisfied by the harshness of his rule, fled to the West.Thousands more have taken to the streets in the last month in East Germany's largest wave of domestic unrest since a workers' uprising in 1953
In Washington, the Bush administration took a characteristically cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change.The official line was to offer warmer ties to Mr. Krenz, provided he is willing to institute reforms
Because Mr. Krenz has been very much in accord with the policies of Honecker.There is no clear-cut champion of reform, that we know of, in the East German leadership
that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups.He said, while dialogue is important, enough forums already exist "in which different interests" can express themselves
The removal of Mr. Honecker was apparently the result of bitter infighting within the top ranks of the Communist party.According to West German government sources, Mr. Honecker and several senior Politburo members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change.But, with public demonstrations in the country growing in size and intensity, Mr. Honecker and several key allies lost out in this battle
Mr. Honecker and several key allies lost out in this battle.Those allies included Politburo members Guenter Mittag and Joachim Hermann

it's still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government's resistance to fundamental change.Clearly, the central figure in this process is Egon Krenz
Clearly, the central figure in this process is Egon Krenz.Born in 1937 in a Baltic Sea town now part of Poland, he was eight years old when World War II ended
Born in 1937 in a Baltic Sea town now part of Poland, he was eight years old when World War II ended.Like West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, he represents the postwar generation that has grown up during Germany's division
Moreover, both men have hewn to a similar hard-line philosophy.Notably, one of Mr. Krenz's few official visits overseas came a few months ago, when he visited China after the massacre in Beijing

He later defended the Chinese government's response during a separate visit to West Germany.East German Protestantism in particular fears Mr. Krenz, in part because of an incident in January 1988 when he was believed to have ordered the arrest of hundreds of dissidents who had sought refuge in the Church
However, Mr. Krenz also has a reputation for being politically savvy.His shrewd ability to read the shifting popular mood in East Germany is best illustrated by his apparent break with his old mentor, Mr. Honecker
Indeed, according to West German government sources, he was one of the leaders in the power struggle that toppled Mr. Honecker.In recent days, Mr. Krenz has sought to project a kinder image
In recent days, Mr. Krenz has sought to project a kinder image.According to a report widely circulating in East Berlin, it was Mr. Krenz who ordered police to stop using excessive force against demonstrators in Leipzig
He doesn't want to have the image of the gun man.He's not a reformer -- he wants to have the image of a reformer
He's not a reformer -- he wants to have the image of a reformer
As part of his image polishing, Mr. Krenz is expected to take modest steps toward reform to rebuild confidence among the people and reassert the party's authority.Besides sacking other senior Politburo officials who allied themselves with Mr. Honecker, Mr. Krenz could loosen controls on the news media, free up travel restrictions, and establish a dialogue with various dissident groups
West German government officials and Western analysts are doubtful. "He doesn't signify what people want, so the unrest will go on
At the same time, the expectations of the East German people are great and will continue to grow.What's necessary now is the process of democratization
What's necessary now is the process of democratization.Not just that people are being heard but that their interests are being taken seriously
Chancellor Kohl, meanwhile, has invited Mr. Krenz to open discussions with Bonn on a wide range of subjects.Mr. Krenz may serve only as a bridge between Mr. Honecker and a genuine reform leader
Reports in the West German press, citing sources in East Germany, suggest Mr. Krenz may serve only as a bridge between Mr. Honecker and a genuine reform leader.Adding to that speculation is Mr. Krenz's reputation as a heavy drinker, who is said to also suffer from diabetes

Two reform-minded party leaders favored by Moscow as possible successors to Mr. Honecker, Dresden party secretary Hans Modrow and Politburo member Guenter Schabowski, were passed over.If Mr. Krenz sticks to rigid policies the pressure from the Soviet Union could intensify
that appeared to urge the new leadership to heed growing calls for change.According to the Soviet news agency Tass, "Gorbachev expressed the conviction that the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of {East} Germany, being sensitive to the demands of the time, . . . will find solutions to complicated problems the GDR {German Democratic Republic} encountered
A force of younger pro-Gorbachev members in the East German bureaucracy has for some time been pushing for relaxation within their country.The older generation has been torn between a fear of tampering with the status quo and a fear of what might happen if they didn't
From the perspective of East Germany's old guard, reforms that smack of capitalism and Western-style democracy could eliminate their country's reason for being.East Germany is a creature of the Cold War
Unlike the other nations of the bloc, East Germany is a creature of the Cold War.Erasing the differences still dividing Europe, and the vast international reordering that implies, won't endanger the statehood of a Poland or a Hungary.But it could ultimately lead to German reunification and the disappearance of East Germany from the map

Which is what the Old Guard fears. "I'm sure they'll formulate a reform that will be a recipe for the GDR's future as a separately identifiable state
Up to now, that recipe has consisted of a dogged effort by former leader Walter Ulbricht to establish the country's international legitimacy, followed by Mr. Honecker's campaign to build the East bloc's only successful Stalinist economy into a consumer paradise.Neither man achieved perfection
The East German media soon began presenting Mr. Gorbachev's speeches only as sketchy summaries, and giving space to his opponents.By late 1988, they were banning Soviet publications
The country abandoned its former devotion to socialist unity and took to insisting instead that each country in the bloc ought to travel its own road.Mr. Honecker spoke of "generally valid objective laws of socialism" and left no room for debate
With this year's dislocations in China and the Soviet Union, and the drive to democracy in Poland and Hungary, the East German leadership grew still more defensive.Politburo member Joachim Herrman confessed to a "grave concern" over Hungarian democracy

Mr. Steinhardt was engaged in a duel with USAir.He was threatening to take over the carrier, after spending an estimated $167 million to build an 8.4% USAir stake for his investment clients
He was threatening to take over the carrier, after spending an estimated $167 million to build an 8.4% USAir stake for his investment clients.The would-be raider even hired an investment banker to give teeth to his takeover threat
In fighting USAir, Mr. Steinhardt was pitted against another investor, billionnaire Warren Buffett, who bought into USAir to help fend off Mr. Steinhardt.Mr. Buffett's firm, Berkshire Hathaway, holds a much bigger stake in the carrier than Mr. Steinhardt's firm, Steinhardt Partners
Now, in the wake of UAL's troubles in financing its buy-out, the airline raiding game has been grounded.Instead of hoping to sell his USAir stake at analysts' estimated buy-out price of $80 a share, Mr. Steinhardt is stuck with roughly 3.7 million USAir shares that cost him $45, on average, but yesterday closed at 40 1/2, up 1/4, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading
At the current price, the USAir holding represents 9% of all the assets that Mr. Steinhardt manages.A week ago, USAir stock briefly soared above 52 after a report in USA Today that Mr. Steinhardt might launch a hostile bid for the carrier, though takeover speculators say they were skeptical
this all goes to show that even the smartest money manager can get infected with crowd passions.In trying to raid USAir, Mr. Steinhardt abandoned his usual role as a passive investor, and ran into snags
that Mr. Steinhardt, the trader, now is encumbered with a massive, illiquid airline holding.USAir stock might lose four or five points if the Steinhardt stake was dumped all at once
Long-term investing -- that's not Steinhardt's style.He doesn't usually risk that much unless he thinks he has an ace in the hole

Dow Chemical Co. said third-quarter net income slipped 6.8% from a record year-ago quarter.The decline broke a streak of 10 quarters in which Dow posted earnings increases
Dow's third-quarter net fell to $589 million, or $3.29 a share, from $632 million, or $3.36 a share, a year ago.Sales in the latest quarter rose 2% to $4.25 billion from $4.15 billion a year earlier
But that signal on full-year profit casts doubt on whether Dow will improve on its year-ago fourth-quarter net of $3.44 a share, or $635 million.Dow would earn $14.85 a share for the year if it equaled that year-ago fourth-quarter performance

For the first nine months of the year, Dow earned $2.06 billion, or $11.41 a share, up 17% from $1.76 billion, or $9.32 a share, a year ago.Sales for the latest nine months rose 7.7% to $13.34 billion from $12.38 billion in the year-ago period
Ethan Bronner's "Battle for Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America" (Norton, 399 pages, $22.50) is a spirited narrative of the nastiest of these hearings, done with journalistic verve, but with a flawed legal philosophy.While the book amply justifies its subtitle, the title itself is dubious

Mr. Bronner seems to believe that the hearings could have gone either way.I doubt that

Another upshot, however, was the chilling message the Bork hearings sent into the judicial culture from which the Supreme Court draws its talent.The word went forth to every law school that those with federal court ambitions must travel a safe constitutional journey, with no paper trail and no bite to their tongue or pen
Unfortunately, the author simply doesn't supply the philosophical frame to sustain his reportorial talents.He has too readily swallowed the case for the activist law school culture
He has too readily swallowed the case for the activist law school culture.Probing more deeply into the doctrine of "judicial restraint," he would have found a long history going back to the great decisions of Justice Holmes
Still, the long view of Robert Bork as constitutional thinker must be a spotty one.His strength lies in his majoritarian doctrine, which keeps the Court clear of transient group pressures and leaves most decisions in a democracy to elected legislatures and executives.Unfortunately, Mr. Bork failed to distinguish between such pressures and the emergence of great issues critical to a society that must be settled judicially if it is to cohere

The Financial Services division has guaranteed the Dorrance family that it will receive a minimum of $100 million for the collection, regardless of what the bids for the art works total, people close to the transaction say.The collection, which includes two early Picassos, a van Gogh, a Monet, other paintings, furniture and porcelains, went on sale last night in the first of six auctions

He is the jealous friend of Philinte, and the jealous lover of Celimene.The play is filled with intrigue, dishonesty and injustice
Otherwise, the scene remained Celimene's house in 1666.Assuming modern audiences readily understand that Moliere's social indictment covers their world as well as 17th-century Paris, Mr. Wilbur concentrated his formidable artistry on rendering the Alexandrine French verse into sprightly and theatrical English iambic pentameter
Mr. Wilbur concentrated his formidable artistry on rendering the Alexandrine French verse into sprightly and theatrical English iambic pentameter.The Wilbur translation is remarkable -- well worth a read and even better seen in the theater if you ever have the opportunity
But if you happen to be coming to Chicago in the next few weeks, don't fail to have a look at Robert Falls's "The Misanthrope" at the Goodman.If Mr. Wilbur's translation is a finely ground lens through which we see the pettiness and corruption of 17th-century Paris, Mr. Falls's production is a mirror in which we see ourselves
Mr. Falls, the Goodman's artistic director, took a recent adaptation by Neil Bartlett and significantly adapted it.Mr. Bartlett had slimmed Moliere's cast of characters to six and set them in the London media world of Thatcherite Britain.Mr. Falls transfers the setting to Hollywood, and transforms the characters into what passes for aristocracy there -- agents, producers, actors, writers and sycophants

With a splendid cast led by David Darlow as Alceste, Christina Haag as Celimene and, especially, William Brown as a Philinte who plays the Hollywood game but harbors authentic values and feelings, the Goodman production barrels through an all-night Hollywood party with exuberance and wit.If this version, with its references to Steven Spielberg, Spago and "thirtysomething" attracts younger audiences who might stay away from the classical version, then Messrs.Bartlett and Falls are justified in abandoning Mr. Wilbur
A 300-year-old play may be easier to revive than one merely 25.The Steppenwolf Theatre Company, back from a critical and box office success in London with its adaptation of Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath," opened the new season with Harold Pinter's "The Homecoming," first produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1965
Back then, Mr. Pinter was not only the angry young British playwright, but also the first to use silences and sentence fragments and menacing stares, almost to the exclusion of what we previously understood to be theatrical dialogue.When "The Homecoming" was first produced on this side of the Atlantic, actors and directors were reverential

Silences were lengthy -- nobody moved or gestured.Nobody smiled onstage, and nobody in the audience was encouraged to laugh.This kind of theater was new to us
But under Jerry Perry's direction the current Steppenwolf production, scheduled to play through Nov. 19, breaks through the flat and boring ritual that "The Homecoming" had become.Led by a near-perfect performance by Alan Wilder as Max, the father, the play is at once an appalling and hilarious dissection of a family's rage, bitterness, fear and isolation
Led by a near-perfect performance by Alan Wilder as Max, the father, the play is at once an appalling and hilarious dissection of a family's rage, bitterness, fear and isolation.Encouraged by Mr. Wilder's sly grins, embarrassed grimaces and sputtering rages, the audience gets the joke and begins to laugh before the end of the first act
Three of the family members, Max and his two sons, Lenny and Joey, live off the flesh: Max is a retired butcher, Lenny a pimp and Joey an aspiring boxer.Sam, Max's brother, has escaped the flesh by working as a liveried chauffeur and never seeking a wife
Sam, Max's brother, has escaped the flesh by working as a liveried chauffeur and never seeking a wife.Teddy, the eldest of Max's sons, has made the most dramatic escape by becoming a professor of philosophy at an American university
Though it's clearly Max's wife who held sway here until her death, now none of the other male residents of this misbegotten household can challenge Max.The play concerns Teddy's homecoming with his wife of six years, Ruth

For all the attention that Chicago theater has received during the past decade, not one new building has been devoted to it.Mr. Sagan, a former publisher and real estate developer, has put together an $8 million financial package that includes approximately $4 million of tax exempt bonds issued by the State of Illinois (the first time that a state has used its educational facilities authority to support construction of a theater), and approximately $1 million in grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the MacArthur Foundation, and a few other deep pockets

The rest, he is confident, can be raised.His board members alone have pledged $800,000 and he is just beginning to massage local foundations and corporations
But Welles's theater company turned out to have a brief -- one might say a mercurial -- existence.What will Mr. Sagan do with his new theater building if the allure of Hollywood and Broadway proves too much for such Steppenwolf stalwarts as John Malkovich ("Dangerous Liaisons"), Joan Allen ("The Heidi Chronicles"), and Glenne Headly ("Lonesome Dove"), and the company crumbles
That's OK," Mr. Sagan replies. "Let this building be Steppenwolf's legacy to Chicago theater

They had dealt a major setback that afternoon to President Bush's capital-gains tax cut proposal, which had seemed in the bag after it passed the House overwhelmingly earlier in the month.Sen. Bradley has it in his mind that such a tax cut would unravel the tax reform he helped engineer in 1986
As a result, he took the lead in arguing that the cut should be blocked on procedural grounds.He helped persuade 10 of these senators to support him and Majority Leader George Mitchell on these grounds
He helped persuade 10 of these senators to support him and Majority Leader George Mitchell on these grounds.The budget reconciliation had to be dealt with by the Oct. 15 deadline, and these Senate Democrats refused to agree to allow a vote to append capital gains to the budget bill
Denied a vote on substance, the GOP leadership in the Senate on Friday morning was confronted with a hard choice.It could throw in the towel and hope to win on capital gains late this month, or it could follow the White House strategy, to veto reconciliation unless capital gains was appended
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has been in the forefront in supporting the Bush proposal.It endorsed the White House strategy, believing it to be the surest way to victory
It endorsed the White House strategy, believing it to be the surest way to victory.At noon Friday, a senior White House official advised Richard Rahn, the Chamber's chief economist, that the White House would not agree to a budget reconciliation bill unless it had firm assurances that a vote on substance would be permitted in the Senate
Two hours later, the first word emerged on Capitol Hill that the administration had agreed to reconciliation with no such assurances from Senate Democrats.Mr. Rahn was shocked, telephoning the office of Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the administration's chief strategist on this issue
Mr. Rahn was shocked, telephoning the office of Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and the administration's chief strategist on this issue.He left a message accusing Mr. Darman of selling out
The stock market reacted as Mr. Rahn did.The stock market, after all, represents the collective expectations about the value of the future income stream of the nation's capital stock, discounted to present value
The total value of privately held assets is easily more than $15 trillion.The value traded on the exchanges is close to $3 trillion
Indeed, the stock market's steady advance this year tracked with President Bush's success in advancing his capital-gains proposal.A 30% cut in this year's capital gains alone amounts to roughly $50 billion
A 30% cut in this year's capital gains alone amounts to roughly $50 billion.We're talking real money
When Richard Rahn advised the financial press that the market crash was caused by the setback to capital gains, he was generally ignored and mildly ridiculed.Instead, the press corps readily accepted the notion that a snag in the takeover financing of United Airlines instantly knocked 7% off the value of the nation's capital stock and caused convulsions around the world.Mr. Rahn was pointing out an elephant rumbling through Wall Street while conventional wisdom had fastened on the UAL flea
For one thing, quite a number of the leading spokesmen on Wall Street are not portfolio managers.They are economists and financial reporters
Yet they somehow think that Wall Street is indifferent to losing the tax cut that seemed so close Friday morning and is now problematic.The market rebound Monday followed weekend assurances from Mr. Darman that the administration has other plans to win the cut, which is alive and well
Sen. Bradley's argument is that a capital-gains tax cut would be bad for the economy in the longer run.It would inevitably lead to an increase in marginal income-tax rates in 1990 when the White House is forced to ask for higher taxes to meet budget targets
That is, with capital gains cut, the glue of the 1986 accord will be gone, and political realities will push up income-tax rates.The counter-argument is that if he and his fellow Democrats are successful in killing the president's proposal, the revenue gap will open up tremendously in 1990 because of the weakened economy
The counter-argument is that if he and his fellow Democrats are successful in killing the president's proposal, the revenue gap will open up tremendously in 1990 because of the weakened economy.there would be no serious consideration of tax increases
If Sen. Bradley would permit a vote on capital gains, though, it would pass, Christmas retail sales would be strong instead of burdened by a falling stock market, the 1990 economy would be robust, and the revenue gains at every level of government, including New Jersey's, would be surprisingly high.No tax increases would be necessary
The struggle over capital gains is the most important game in town.In Washington and on Wall Street

Proceeds from the bonds, with coupon rates in the 8% range, will be used to replace bonds with an average interest rate of 13.1%.the refinancing should save $75 million a year in interest payments
The Tennessee Valley Authority issued $4 billion in bonds in the federal utility's first public debt offering in 15 years. Proceeds from the bonds, with coupon rates in the 8% range, will be used to replace bonds with an average interest rate of 13.1%.The TVA said the refinancing should save $75 million a year in interest payments. The refinancing is part of the TVA's strategy of dealing with what has been an intractable problem: its staggering $18.5 billion debt, most of which is owed to the Treasury Department's Federal Financing Bank.The TVA currently plans to issue a total of $6.7 billion in bonds to refinance its high-interest debt
The TVA, in fact, decided to proceed with the bond offering following an agreement last week with the Financing Bank.The Treasury contended that TVA couldn't borrow from both it and the public debt market
The $4 billion in bonds break down as follows: $1 billion in five-year bonds with a coupon rate of 8.25% and a yield to maturity of 8.33%; $1 billion in 10-year bonds with a coupon rate of 8.375% and a yield to maturity of 8.42%; $2 billion in 30-year bonds with five-year call protection, a coupon rate of 8.75% and a yield to maturity of 9.06%.Managing the bond issue is a group of investment banks headed by First Boston Corp. and co-managed by Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, Morgan Stanley & Co., and Salomon Brothers Inc

The Beebes alleged that toxic fumes from the carpets made them sick.As a result of their illness they lost $1.8 million in wages and earnings
The case had been closely watched because attorneys anticipate increasing litigation nationally over the so-called sick-building syndrome.Plaintiffs' lawyers say that buildings become "sick" when inadequate fresh air and poor ventilation systems lead pollutants to build up inside
the Beebes' symptoms were not related to the carpeting.He said that ill effects from new carpets manifest themselves immediately but that the Beebes' symptoms appeared months later
the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing such suits.Scientists are only beginning to understand what causes sick-building syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the Beebes filed the case

Early in October, six Arab nations in the Persian Gulf jacked up prices sharply.On Oct. 22, led by Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter, they embargoed oil shipments to the U.S. and to the Netherlands, Israel's staunchest European ally

U.S. oil supplies, however, had peaked in 1970 and 1971 and by 1973 were declining.Imports, then six million barrels a day, came primarily from Venezuela and Canada
But Middle East supplies were growing in importance.By 1973, the U.S. was bringing in two million barrels of Arab oil a day, more than 10% of the 17.3 million barrels consumed daily
Politics and economics conspired.Japan and Europe, far more dependent on Mideast oil than the U.S., wouldn't offend the Arabs or trade off their precious supplies

Just after midnight Monday, federal spending started to drop by $16 billion.What do you say we all close down the poker game, go home and bank the $16 billion

The solution, at least for some investors, may be a hedging technique that's well known to players in the stock-options market.Called a "married put," the technique is carried out by purchasing a stock and simultaneously buying a put option on that stock
It's like "fire insurance.Because a put option gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell a fixed number of shares of the stock at a stated price on or before the option's expiration date, the investor is protected against a sudden drop in the stock's price
But most investment advisers don't recommend using married puts all the time.That's because the cost of buying put options eats into an investor's profit when stock prices rise
This is the type of fire insurance you only buy when the nearby woods are on fire.but you don't always feel the need for your investments to be insured
In addition to hedging new stock purchases, the married-put technique can be used to protect stocks that an investor already owns.In either case, the investor faces three possible outcomes
If the stock goes up in price between now and the put's expiration date, the put will probably expire worthless.The investor will be out the cost of the put and this loss will reduce the stock-market profit
If the stock stays at the same price between now and the put's expiration date, the investor's loss will be limited to the cost of the put, less any amount realized from a closing sale of the put.The worst-case scenario would be if the put expires worthless
If the price of the stock declines, the put will increase in value.Once the stock price is less than the exercise price, or "strike price," of the put, the gain will match the loss on the stock dollar for dollar
Once the stock price is less than the exercise price, or "strike price," of the put, the gain will match the loss on the stock dollar for dollar.The put establishes a minimum selling price for the stock during its life
Or, the investor can exercise the put, by tendering the stock to his or her broker in return for payment from another investor who has sold a put on the same stock.Brokers handle such transactions through the Options Clearing Corp., which guarantees all option trades
The accompanying table shows how this strategy would work for three stocks.Though not reflected in the table, an investor should know that the cost of the option insurance can be partially offset by any dividends that the stock pays
For example, Tenneco Inc. pays a quarterly dividend of 76 cents, which would be received before the February option expires and, thus, reduce the cost of using the technique by that amount.In this case, the investor's risk wouldn't exceed 3.6% of the total investment
In this case, the investor's risk wouldn't exceed 3.6% of the total investment.To simplify the calculations, commissions on the option and underlying stock aren't included in the table
For instance, the most popular index option is the S&P 100 option, commonly called the OEX.It is based on the stocks that make up Standard & Poor's 100-stock index
It is based on the stocks that make up Standard & Poor's 100-stock index.Unlike options on individual issues, index options are settled only in cash, and no stock is ever tendered
On the other hand, only a handful of individual issues were suspended from trading on Friday.Normally, once the underlying investment is suspended from trading, the options on those investments also don't trade
Ultimately, whether the insurance provided by purchasing puts is worthwhile depends on the cost of the options.That cost rises in times of high market volatility
The protection from using married puts is clearly superior to that afforded by another options strategy some investors consider using during troubled times: selling call options on stocks the investor owns.A call option is similar to a put, except that it gives its owner the right to buy shares at a stated price until expiration
Selling a call option gives an investor a small buffer against a stock-market decline.That's because it reduces the cost of the stock by the amount of premium received from the sale of the call
These calculations exclude the effect of commissions paid and dividends received from the stock.All prices are as of Monday's close

The merchandise trade deficit widened in August to $10.77 billion, the Commerce Department reported, a sharp deterioration from July's $8.24 billion and the largest deficit of any month this year.Exports fell for the second month in a row, while imports rose to a record
This is one of the worst trade releases we've had since the dollar troughed out in 1987," said Geoffrey Dennis, chief international economist at James Capel Inc. Like most analysts, Mr. Dennis was hesitant to read too much into one month's numbers
The number had a troubling effect on Wall Street.The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled more than 60 points after the report's release, before recovering to close 18.65 points lower at 2638.73
This bad trade number raises some deeper issues about the market decline.It raises questions about more deep-seated problems, the budget deficit and the trade deficit and the seeming lack of ability to come to grips with them
The trade report drew yet another unsettling parallel to October 1987.On Oct. 14 of that year, the announcement of an unusually large August trade deficit helped trigger a steep market decline
On Oct. 14 of that year, the announcement of an unusually large August trade deficit helped trigger a steep market decline.The slide continued until the record 508-point market drop on Oct. 19
The bleak trade report was played down by the Bush administration.Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher called the worsening trade figures "disappointing after two very good months
The figures today add further evidence to support the view that the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit has essentially stalled out at a level of about a $110 billion annual rate.That's still an improvement over last year, but it leads one to conclude that basically we've gotten all the mileage we can out of past dollar depreciation and past marginal cuts in the federal budget deficit
that deep cuts in the U.S. budget deficit are needed before further trade improvement can occur.That's because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign capital, overwhelming the nation's capacity to export
That's because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign capital, overwhelming the nation's capacity to export. "People are sick and tired of hearing about these deficits, but the imbalances are still there and they are still a problem," said Mr. Robertson
In addition, the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of U.S. products in overseas markets and hurt the country's competitiveness.Since March, exports have been virtually flat
The best result we could get from these numbers would be to see the administration and Congress get serious about putting the U.S. on an internationally competitive economic footing," said Howard Lewis, vice president of international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers. "That must start with cutting the federal budget deficit
August's decline in exports reflected decreases in sales of industrial supplies, capital goods and food abroad and increases in sales of motor vehicles, parts and engines.The jump in imports stemmed from across-the-board increases in purchases of foreign goods

Universities can now buy a Next computer without an optical storage device for $4,995.A computer with the optical device will still cost $6,495, but from now on Next will outfit every computer with a hard drive and supply one at no cost to those who have already bought Next machines
the changes were prompted by requests from customers who are frustrated with the performance of the optical device.Another factor was that customers were asking, "Why don't you give us a cheaper system?
Another factor was that customers were asking, "Why don't you give us a cheaper system?" Mr. Jobs said at a conference on university computing here.Optical-storage devices can handle very large amounts of data and make it far easier to edit film clips or audio recordings with a computer

GTE Corp. and MCI Communications Corp. reported strong earnings gains to record levels for the third quarter.Southwestern Bell Corp. and Cincinnati Bell posted slight declines
GTE said net income rose 18%, aided by higher long-distance calling volumes and an increase in telephone lines in service.Pretax operating profit from telephone operations rose 8.2% but profits from telecommunications products and electrical products were flat

Arbitragers weren't the only big losers in the collapse of UAL Corp. stock.Look at what happened to UAL's chairman, Stephen M. Wolf, and its chief financial officer, John C. Pope
When bank financing for the buy-out collapsed last week, so did UAL's stock.Even if the banks resurrect a financing package at $250 a share, the two executives would still get about $25 million less than they stood to gain in the initial transaction

The 40-year old Mr. Pope hasn't changed jobs enough -- at least the right ones -- to stash away that kind of money.United paid him a $375,000 bonus to lure him away from American Airlines, and he was paid a salary of $342,122 last year with a $280,000 bonus
Mr. Pope owns 10,000 UAL shares and has options to buy another 150,000 at $69 each.That came to a combined $37.7 million under the $300-a-share buy-out, but just $21.3 million at yesterday's close

Deeply ingrained in both the book review "Kissing Nature Good-bye" by Stephen MacDonald (Leisure & Arts, Sept. 27) and the books reviewed is the assumption that global warming is entirely a result of human activity.Is such a view justified

When Maj. Moises Giroldi, the leader of the abortive coup in Panama, was buried, his body bore several gunshot wounds, a cracked skull and broken legs and ribs.They were the signature of his adversary, Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega
The rebel officer's slow and painful death was personally supervised by Gen. Noriega.Leaping into rages, sinking into bouts of drunkenness and mistrust, Mr. Noriega has put to death some 70 of his troops involved in the coup, according to U.S. officials monitoring crematoriums and funeral parlors in Panama City
He is now changing the place he sleeps every night, sometimes more than once a night.His meals are most often prepared by women he trusts -- his full-time mistress, Vicky Amado, and her mother, Norma
And he is collecting the names of those who telephoned the coup-makers to congratulate them during their brief time in control of his headquarters.More enemies to be dealt with
it is merely the latest chapter in a byzantine relationship between Mr. Noriega and Washington that stretches back three decades.America's war on the dictator over the past two years, following his indictment on drug charges in February 1988, is the legacy of that relationship
America's war on the dictator over the past two years is the legacy of that relationship.Before American foreign policy set out to destroy Noriega, it helped create him out of the crucible of Panama's long history of conspirators and pirates
for allegedly raping and savagely beating a prostitute, according to a U.S. Embassy cable from that period.The woman had nearly died
But U.S. intelligence, rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy, merely filed the report away.Mr. Noriega's tips on emerging leftists at his school were deemed more important to U.S. interests
But U.S. intelligence, rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy, merely filed the report away.Mr. Noriega's tips on emerging leftists at his school were deemed more important to U.S. interests.From that point on, the U.S. would make a practice of overlooking the Panamanian's misadventures
The U.S. has befriended and later turned against many dictators, but none quite so resourceful.The 55-year-old Mr. Noriega isn't as smooth as the shah of Iran, as well-born as Nicaragua's Anastasio Somoza, as imperial as Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines or as bloody as Haiti's Baby Doc Duvalier.Yet he has proved more resilient than any of them
The U.S. underestimated Noriega all along.He has mastered the art of survival
In keeping with America's long history of propping up Mr. Noriega, recent U.S. actions have extended rather than shortened his survival.Mr. Noriega might have fallen of his own weight in 1988 because of Panama's dire economic situation but increasing external pressure has only given him additional excuses for repression, and a scapegoat for his own mismanagement
Perhaps most important, Mr. Noriega's allies have intervened to encourage -- in some cases, to demand -- that the dictator maintain his grip of the throne.One Colombian drug boss, upon hearing in 1987 that Gen. Noriega was negotiating with the U.S. to abandon his command for a comfortable exile, sent him a hand-sized mahogany coffin engraved with his name
He is cornered.The Americans have left him without a way out
The Americans have left him without a way out.It is easy to fight when you don't have any other option
His chief advantage in the fight: his intimate knowledge of American ways and weaknesses.Mr. Noriega often tells friends that patience is the best weapon against the gringos, who have a short attention span and little stomach for lasting confrontation
The U.S. discovered the young Tony Noriega in late 1959, when he was in his second year at the Chorrillos Military Academy in Lima, according to former U.S. intelligence officials.The contact occurred through Mr. Noriega's half-brother, a Panamanian diplomat based in Peru named Luis Carlos Noriega Hurtado.Luis Carlos, knowing that helping the Americans could advance the career of any Panamanian officer, relayed Tony's reports on the leftist tendencies he observed among his fellow students and, more important, among his officers and instructors

Luis Carlos relayed Tony's reports on the leftist tendencies he observed among his fellow students and, more important, among his officers and instructors.A spy was born
It was a heady experience for the pockmarked and slightly built Mr. Noriega, who was known to his friends as Cara la Pina -- pineapple face.Born the illegitimate son of his father's maid, he was raised on the mean streets of the central market district of Panama City
Born the illegitimate son of his father's maid, he was raised on the mean streets of the central market district of Panama City.Tony was four years older than most of his fellow cadets, and gained admission to the academy because his brother had falsified his birth certificate
Tony was four years older than most of his fellow cadets, and gained admission to the academy because his brother had falsified his birth certificate.He considered himself intellectually superior to his Peruvian peers, many of whom were wayward sons sent by their well-off families to the highly disciplined, French-modeled academy as a sort of reform school
In his peaked military cap and neatly pressed, French-made uniform, Noriega felt more respected and powerful than ever in his underprivileged life.He had an elegant uniform with gold buttons in a country where there was a cult of militarism, where officers were the elite with special privileges
Mr. Noriega's relationship to American intelligence agencies became contractual in either 1966 or 1967.His commanding officer at the Chiriqui Province garrison, Major Omar Torrijos, gave him an intriguing assignment: Mr. Noriega would organize the province's first intelligence service
His commanding officer at the Chiriqui Province garrison, Major Omar Torrijos, gave him an intriguing assignment: Mr. Noriega would organize the province's first intelligence service
The spy network would serve two clients: the Panamanian government, by monitoring political opponents in the region, and the U.S., by tracking the growing Communist influence in the unions organized at United Fruit Co. 's banana plantations in Bocas del Toros and Puerto Armuelles.United Fruit was one of the two largest contributors to Panama's national income
United Fruit was one of the two largest contributors to Panama's national income.Satisfying its interests was a priority for any Panamanian leader
Mr. Noriega's initial retainer was only $50 to $100 a month, plus occasional gifts of liquor or groceries from the American PX.It was modest pay by American standards, but a healthy boost to his small military salary, which fellow officers remember as having been $300 to $400 monthly
He did it very well.He started building the files that helped him gain power
A National Guard job assumed by Capt. Noriega in 1964 -- as chief of the transit police in David City, capital of the Chiriqui Province -- was tailor-made for an aspiring super-spy.By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses, he gained a ready cache of information
By pressuring taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses, he gained a ready cache of information.He knew which local luminaries had been caught driving drunk, which had been found with their mistresses
This proved particularly valuable to the Panamanian government in 1967, when union leaders were planning a May Day march that the government feared could turn violent.Mr. Noriega had learned that a local union leader was sleeping with the wife of his deputy
So he splashed the information on handbills that he distributed throughout the banana-exporting city of Puerto Armuelles, which was ruled by United Fruit Co.The campaign so divided union leaders that the government found them far easier to control
It was like a play on Broadway," recalls Mr. Martinez. "Noriega managed the whole thing
Noriega managed the whole thing.He was superb
He was superb.Noriega was an expert at bribing and blackmailing people
During his years in Chiriqui, however, Mr. Noriega also revealed himself as an officer as perverse as he was ingenious.Rodrigo Miranda, a local lawyer and human-rights monitor, recalls an intoxicated Noriega visiting prisoners in their cells at the 5th Zone Garrison headquarters in David, where he had his offices.Mr. Noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked, laughing at them and then retreating to his office

Mr. Noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the courtyard naked, laughing at them and then retreating to his office. "People started wondering if something was wrong with him
But through this period, so far as the U.S. military was concerned, Mr. Noriega was a model recruit.He signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under American officers at Fort Gulick in Panama in July 1967, according to a copy of a 1983 resume with details Mr. Noriega has since classified as secret
He signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under American officers at Fort Gulick in Panama in July 1967, according to a copy of a 1983 resume with details Mr. Noriega has since classified as secret.He flew to Fort Bragg, N.C., in September of that year for a course in psychological operations, returning to the School of the Americas in Panama for a two-month course called "military intelligence for officers
Some American officers interpreted his eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty, but they did so falsely.He rose to chief of intelligence in Panama's socalled G-2 in 1970 after providing populist dictator Torrijos the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier
He rose to chief of intelligence in Panama's socalled G-2 in 1970 after providing populist dictator Torrijos the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier.He became Gen. Torrijos's inseparable shadow, and the holder of all Panama's secrets
He became Gen. Torrijos's inseparable shadow, and the holder of all Panama's secrets.Mr. Noriega, by now a lieutenant colonel, expanded his contacts to include the Cubans -- not to mention the Israelis, the Taiwanese and any other intelligence service that came knocking
Mr. Noriega, by now a lieutenant colonel, expanded his contacts to include the Cubans -- not to mention the Israelis, the Taiwanese and any other intelligence service that came knocking.When U.S. diplomats complained to the CIA of Col. Noriega's moonlighting, intelligence experts always insisted that his allegiance was first to the Americans
Early on in the State Department, we took to calling him the rent-a-colonel, in tribute to his ability to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of Cuba and the United States.Some of us wondered how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the Cubans
Even at this early stage, drugs caused additional concerns.During the Nixon administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the G-2's connections to arrested drug traffickers
During the Nixon administration, the Drug Enforcement Administration became dismayed at the extent of the G-2's connections to arrested drug traffickers.One DEA agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with Col. Noriega, one of which was assassination
that Gen. Torrijos seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the U.S. "Everybody was afraid of him
Mr. Noriega became an even greater threat in 1976, when U.S. intelligence services discovered that he had been buying recordings of electronically monitored conversations from three sergeants working for the U.S. Army's 470th Military Intelligence Group.The tapes included wiretaps of Gen. Torrijos's own phone, according to American intelligence officials
For the first time, the U.S. considered cutting Mr. Noriega from its intelligence payroll -- and the deliberations were intense.In the world of intelligence, if you want to get information, you get it from seedy characters
In the world of intelligence, if you want to get information, you get it from seedy characters.The question is how much you get tied in with seedy characters so they can extort you
Intelligence officials to this day worry whether Mr. Noriega sold sensitive information on the recordings to the Cubans or others.Mr. Turner was troubled enough to cancel the U.S. contract with the rent-a-colonel at the beginning of the Carter administration
The U.S. soon found new cause for concern: gun-running.Prosecutors in Southern Florida indicted five Panamanians on charges of illegally running arms to Sandinista rebels trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan government of Mr. Somoza
Prosecutors in Southern Florida indicted five Panamanians on charges of illegally running arms to Sandinista rebels trying to overthrow the Nicaraguan government of Mr. Somoza.They included one of Mr. Noriega's closest friends and business partners, Carlos Wittgreen
At the time, though, in 1979, the U.S. was once again flirting with its longtime Latin American spy.Mr. Noriega made plans to fly to Washington for a meeting with his counterpart at the Pentagon
Mr. Noriega made plans to fly to Washington for a meeting with his counterpart at the Pentagon.Dade County and federal authorities, learning that he intended to fly through Miami, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil
Dade County and federal authorities, learning that he intended to fly through Miami, made plans to arrest him on the gun-running charges as soon as he hit U.S. soil.It was a Friday in June
The Pentagon foiled the plan.According to military officers at the time, word was passed to Mr. Noriega by his American hosts that the police would be waiting
According to military officers at the time, word was passed to Mr. Noriega by his American hosts that the police would be waiting.On Monday, U.S. officials received a routine, unclassified message from the military group commander in Panama
On Monday, U.S. officials received a routine, unclassified message from the military group commander in Panama. "Due to health reasons, Lt. Col. Noriega has elected to postpone his visit to Washington," it read
Prosecutors in Miami received yet another setback.Their original indictment against Mr. Wittgreen, the friend of Mr. Noriega, and the other four was dismissed on a technicality
In January 1980, Jerome Sanford, as assistant U.S. attorney, was summoned to a meeting with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent assigned to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Miami.Panamanian dictator Torrijos, he was told, had granted the shah of Iran asylum in Panama as a favor to Washington
Panamanian dictator Torrijos, he was told, had granted the shah of Iran asylum in Panama as a favor to Washington.Mr. Sanford was told Mr. Noriega's friend, Mr. Wittgreen, would be handling the shah's security
Mr. Noriega's friend, Mr. Wittgreen, would be handling the shah's security.It wouldn't be a good idea to indict him -- much less Mr. Noriega
After prodding from Mr. Sanford, U.S. Attorney Jack Eskenazi pleaded with Justice Department officials in Washington to let the indictment proceed. "Unfortunately," Mr. Eskenazi wrote in a letter, "those of us in law enforcement in Miami find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the United States but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control
Unfortunately," Mr. Eskenazi wrote in a letter, "those of us in law enforcement in Miami find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the United States but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control." The letter, along with a detailed prosecution memo, sat on the desks of Justice officials for months before the case died a quiet death
if we had been allowed to go ahead then we wouldn't have the problems we have now.If he had been found guilty, we could have stopped him
In August 1983, Mr. Noriega took over as General and de-facto dictator of Panama, having maneuvered his way to the top only two years after the mysterious death in a plane crash of his old boss Omar Torrijos.Soon, the military became a veritable mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses
Soon, the military became a veritable mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses.The Reagan administration also put Mr. Noriega's G-2 back on the U.S. payroll
The Reagan administration also put Mr. Noriega's G-2 back on the U.S. payroll.Payments averaged nearly $200,000 a year from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA
Although working for U.S. intelligence, Mr. Noriega was hardly helping the U.S. exclusively.During the Reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the Cubans and the Sandinistas
During the Reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the Cubans and the Sandinistas.He allegedly entered into Panama's first formal business arrangement with Colombian drug bosses, according to Floyd Carlton, a pilot who once worked for Mr. Noriega and who testified before the U.S. grand jury in Miami that would ultimately indict the Panamanian on drug charges
But Mr. Noriega was convinced the Reagan White House wouldn't act against him because he had an insurance policy: his involvement with the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.the general allowed the Contras to set up a secret training center in Panama
Mr. Blandon says the general allowed the Contras to set up a secret training center in Panama.Mr. Noriega also conveyed intelligence from his spy operation inside the Nicaraguan capital of Managua.And on at least one occasion, in the spring of 1985, he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a Sandinista arsenal in Nicaragua.Although, his help for the Contra cause was limited, it was enough to win him important protectors in the Reagan administration
Although, his help for the Contra cause was limited, it was enough to win him important protectors in the Reagan administration.Noriega played U.S. intelligence agencies and the U.S. government like a violin
An incident in 1984 suggested one additional means by which Mr. Noriega might have maintained such influence with Washington -- by compromising U.S. officials.Curtin Windsor, then the ambassador to Costa Rica, recalls being invited to Panama by Mr. Noriega's brother Luis Carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and "quiet, serious conversation" on the Aswara Peninsula

Mr. Windsor notified Everett E. Briggs, the U.S. ambassador to Panama, of the invitation. "Briggs screamed," Mr. Windsor recalls
Briggs screamed.he was being set up for a "honey trap
He says Mr. Briggs told him he was being set up for a "honey trap," in which Mr. Noriega would try to involve him in an orgy and then record the event "with sound and video." Mr. Briggs, on vacation after resigning his position at the National Security Council, couldn't be reached for comment
Yet, his political setbacks mounted.Mr. Noriega was accused of ordering in 1985 the beheading of Hugo Spadafora, his most outspoken political opponent and the first man to publicly finger Mr. Noriega on drug trafficking charges
Mr. Noriega was accused of ordering in 1985 the beheading of Hugo Spadafora, his most outspoken political opponent and the first man to publicly finger Mr. Noriega on drug trafficking charges.He then ousted President Nicholas Ardito Barletta, a former World Bank official with close ties to the U.S., after Mr. Barletta tried to create a commission to investigate the murder.And, all the while, Panama's debt problems continued to grow.Mr. Noriega was growing desperate
In late 1986, he made an offer he thought the U.S. couldn't refuse.Mr. Noriega offered to assassinate the Sandinista leadership in exchange "for a promise to help clean up Noriega's image and a commitment to lift the {U.S.} ban on military sales to the Panamanian Defense Forces
North has told Noriega's representative that U.S. law forbade such actions.The representative responded that Noriega had numerous assets in place in Nicaragua and could accomplish many essential things, just as Noriega had helped {the U.S.} the previous year in blowing up a Sandinista arsenal
Col. North conveyed the request to his superiors and to Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams, who relayed it to Secretary of State George Shultz.Mr. Noriega's proposal was turned down
The end of the marriage was at hand.Within weeks the unfolding Iran-Contra scandal took away Mr. Noriega's insurance policy

Lawyers in Miami -- this time working virtually without impediment -- prepared to have him indicted on drug charges in February 1988.During negotiations with American officials in May 1988 over proposals to drop the U.S. indictments in exchange for his resignation, Mr. Noriega often asked almost plaintively how the Americans, whom he had helped for so many years, could turn against him

The new reports of sluggishness, which were foreshadowed by an earlier Labor Department report that manufacturing payrolls dropped by 105,000 in September, give the Fed another reason to further ease its grip on credit and lower interest rates. "They need to do something about this

Factory output dropped 0.2%, its first decline since February, after having been unchanged in October.Factories operated at 83.7% of capacity, the lowest rate in more than a year and down from 84.1% in September
The declines mainly reflected widespread weakness in durable goods, those intended to last more than three years.The biggest drop was recorded by primary metals producers, a category that includes the steel industry
Output of business equipment was unchanged in September.Production of factory equipment, one indication of the strength of manufacturers' investment spending, fell 0.3%

The report, which comes 25 years after the U.S. Surgeon General issued a report warning against the dangers of smoking, is the strongest indication to date that the reduction in smoking is leading to lower death rates from lung cancer. "What this is saying is that the surgeon general's message is having an impact
The National Cancer Institute report compares mortality rates of two groups of people between the ages of 35 and 44 a decade apart.The death rate from lung cancer of white males aged 35 to 44 in the mid-1970s was 13.4 per 100,000, but the mortality rate of the same age group in the mid-1980s was 9.6, a decline of 28.7%

Measured the same way, the decline for black males was 14.2%.The drop in mortality rates for women was less steep -- 8.9% for blacks and 5.3% for whites
Even though these favorable trends in lung-cancer mortality affect all sex and race groups, they can't be taken for granted.Smoking prevention programs should reach larger segments of the population, especially children, adolescents and minorities
But the editorial, by Jan Stjernsward of the World Health Organization, notes that tobacco consumption and lung-cancer mortality rates are rising in developing countries. "Non-smoking should be established as the norm of social behavior" around the world, the editorial says, through the enactment of laws that limit advertising, boost tobacco prices and promote anti-smoking education
According to the American Cancer Society, smoking is responsible for 85% of the lung-cancer cases among men and 75% among women.The NCI report attributes the differences in mortality rates by race to different smoking patterns

A second phase of research, which is still being planned, will test reformulated gasolines on newer engine technologies now being developed for use in 1992 or 1993 cars.There was no cost estimate for the second phase
Instead, a House subcommittee adopted a clean-fuels program that specifically mentions reformulated gasoline as an alternative.The Bush administration has said it will try to resurrect its plan when the House Energy and Commerce Committee takes up a comprehensive clean-air bill
Mr. Seidman, who has been the nation's top bank regulator, inherited the problems of Lincoln, based in Irvine, Calif., after his regulatory role was expanded by the new savings-and-loan bailout law.He made his comments before House Banking Committee hearings to investigate what appears to be the biggest thrift disaster in a scandal-ridden industry
Mr. Seidman told the committee that the Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created to sell sick thrifts, has studied Lincoln's examination reports by former regulators dating back to 1986. "My staff indicated that had we made such findings in one of our own institutions, we would have sought an immediate cease-and-desist order to stop the hazardous operations," Mr. Seidman said
But the government didn't step in until six months ago, when thrift officials put Lincoln into conservatorship -- the day after American Continental filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors.The bankruptcy filing, the government has charged in a $1.1 billion civil lawsuit, was part of a pattern to shift insured deposits to the parent company, which used the deposits as a cache for real-estate deals

The deposits that have been transferred to other subsidiaries are now under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court. "I think it's fairly clear {Mr.Keating} knew," that regulators were set to seize Lincoln, Mr. Seidman said

After the government lawsuit was filed against Lincoln, Sen. DeConcini returned the campaign contributions.The senator's spokesman said yesterday that he pushed for the sale of Lincoln because "hundreds of Arizona jobs {at Lincoln} were on the line
He also held out little hope of restitution for purchasers of $225 million in American Continental subordinated debt.Some of those debtholders have filed a suit, saying they believed they were buying government-insured certificates of deposit

At a later news conference here, Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., said Eastern was exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and predicted it would emerge from Chapter 11 protection from creditors early next year, operating with more service than it originally had scheduled.He insisted, as he has before, that creditors would be paid in full under the plan
We're in the process of discussing an amended plan with the creditors and anticipate filing that amended plan shortly," Mr. Lorenzo told reporters. "We're meeting and surpassing our goals," he added
But after selling off pieces such as its East Coast shuttle, its Philadelphia hub and various planes, Eastern hit a stumbling block.It couldn't sell its South American routes, one of the major assets marked for disposal
Those routes, valued by the creditors' professionals at about $400 million, were to be sold to AMR Corp. 's American Airlines.A last-minute snag in negotiations with AMR caused the deal to collapse
It also would leave Eastern a bigger carrier than the scaled-down one proposed under the initial plan.Those changes in its condition meant the reorganization plan previously presented to creditors would have to be revamped
but the creditors committee has been having problems with the revisions.The committee has two groups of experts it calls on to analyze Eastern's plans.Both said the new plan wouldn't work
The committee has two groups of experts it calls on to analyze Eastern's plans.Both said the new plan wouldn't work
Eastern would have to issue new debt to cover its costs, and that it would generate far less cash than anticipated.Other costs also would increase, including maintenance, because Eastern has an older fleet
At the news conference, Mr. Lorenzo and Eastern President Phil Bakes presented a far rosier assessment.Flanked by flight attendants, pilots and gate agents dressed in spiffy new blue uniforms, they said Eastern has exceeded its operational goals and is filling its seats.Starting next month, Eastern will begin flying 775 flights daily instead of the previously announced 700, they said. Mr. Bakes declined to give out Eastern's daily losses, but said he didn't expect Eastern would have to dip into the cash from asset sales currently held in escrow.These accounts hold several hundred million dollars, primarily from asset sales.The plan Eastern hopes to pursue, he said, calls for Eastern to have $390 million in cash by year's end.Both he and Mr. Lorenzo predicted that plan might be confirmed in January

That deadline has been extended once and could be extended again.If Eastern can get creditor support, court confirmation of its plan could be relatively swift

In any event, some people familiar with the case question whether the court will act by January as forecast by Mr. Lorenzo and Mr. Bakes.Eastern sought bankruptcy-law protection a few days after a crippling strike began March 4
Mr. Lorenzo told reporters the reorganization Eastern is pursuing would create a carrier 85% to 90% of the size of the pre-bankruptcy Eastern.He projected it would be operating about 1,000 flights a day by late spring, only slightly fewer than the carrier's old volume of 1,050 a day

From about 200,000 six years ago, the number of mountain bikes in the U.S. is expected to grow to 10 million in 1990.At least half that growth will have come in the past three years alone.The controversy kicked up by the proliferation of these all-terrain bicycles is one of the most divisive storms to blow through the national conservation movement in recent memory
Key to the issue is that the bikes, in skillful hands, can go virtually anywhere, and in reckless hands can become vehicles of terror.An adept bicyclist can leap from a dead stop to the top of a picnic table without losing balance
An adept bicyclist can leap from a dead stop to the top of a picnic table without losing balance.Such skills allow riders to fly down treacherous mountain grades at speeds of up to 40 miles an hour -- a thrill for the cyclist but a nightmare for unsuspecting hikers or equestrians
For harried public-land managers across the nation, the response is increasingly to shut the gates.The state of California, following the lead of some regional parks, recently adopted regulations that closed nearly all hiking paths in state parks to mountain bicycles

The bikes are unwelcome on trails in national parks.Even the U.S. Forest Service, whose lenient "multiple-use" philosophy permits motorized vehicles on thousands of miles of its trails across the U.S., has begun to close some lands to the bikes, including major portions of the popular Pacific Crest Trail, which stretches from California to Canada
Often these closings come after vigorous anti-bike lobbying by conservation organizations, the politically potent Sierra Club among them.Sierra has been instrumental in securing a number of the California bans
Sierra has been instrumental in securing a number of the California bans.It has been waging an all-out campaign to beat back a proposal, pushed by Utah bike groups, to allow the cycles in federally designated wilderness areas
Yet Sierra's hard-line stance has created something of a rift in the organization, which estimates that 17% of its 500,000 members own mountain bikes.Pressure from these members prompted the club recently to soften its anti-bike rhetoric
But the club still insists that public lands ought to be closed to the bikes unless studies indicate the bikes won't injure the environment or other users. "I have a mountain bike, yet as a hiker I've been run off the road by kids careening down a fire trail on them," says Gene Coan, an official at Sierra's headquarters in San Francisco

fellow bikers show the same concern for the land that they demonstrated as hikers; many are appalled that the conservation community would suddenly consider them the enemy
To fight back, activists such as Mr. Langton are forming groups to lobby land managers over access issues and undertake education programs to show that the bikes can responsibly share trails.Mr. Langton's group, Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Association, mounted petition drives to help keep open certain Santa Monica Mountain trails designated for closing

These groups have been trying to improve the mountain biker's image; in the San Francisco-area park district where a ranger was clobbered by a cyclist this summer bikers have formed a volunteer patrol to help rangers enforce regulations
Even staunch anti-bike Sierra members concede that 10% of all riders cause most of the problems.While some are renegade riders who simply scorn regulations, much bad riding simply reflects ignorance that can be corrected through "education and peer pressure

The arms-kickback scandal is likely to be one of the big talking points in the campaign, but it's unclear how it is viewed by average Indian voters.In 1986, India signed a $1.4 billion contract with AB Bofors, a unit of Nobel Industries Sweden AB, to purchase 400 artillery pieces
In 1986, India signed a $1.4 billion contract with AB Bofors, a unit of Nobel Industries Sweden AB, to purchase 400 artillery pieces.The contract was negotiated by the countries' two prime ministers, and was supposed to be free of commissions or agents' costs
In April 1987, evidence surfaced that commissions were paid.The opposition charged that the money was used to bribe Indian government officials
But many of his statements on the issue in Parliament subsequently were proven wrong by documentary evidence.The scandal has faded and flared
and that has helped galvanize the opposition, which last week blocked passage of two constitutional amendment bills.It was the first time in 20 years that such government bills were defeated
In a country where a bribe is needed to get a phone, a job, and even into a school, the name Bofors has become a potent rallying cry against the government.That illustrates the kind of disappointment many Indians feel toward Mr. Gandhi, whom they zestfully elected and enthusiastically supported in his first two years in power

And a squad of influential former Senate aides employed by the Wall Street firm Salomon Brothers came to the Capitol in a vain attempt to strip the provision.By an 11-2 margin, Senate negotiators voted to preserve the 235 mortgage refinancing plan, and despite powerful allies, the opposition found itself undercut by an unusual alliance of liberals and conservatives
The government currently is subsidizing an estimated 23,000 loans above 11% under the 235 program, and however disruptive to private investors, the refinancing is expected to yield at least $15 million in savings in fiscal 1990.This sum has been guarded jealously by appropriators anxious to offset spending elsewhere, and conservative Sen.

as the administration won final congressional approval of $9 million in assistance for elections scheduled in Nicaragua in February.The bulk of the money would be funneled through the National Endowment for Democracy, but the legislation is so vaguely written that it has been dogged by questions regarding the money's true purpose and its ultimate destination
but behind the bipartisan leadership, a solid majority took shape yesterday and brushed aside amendments seeking to cut the total package or steer it away from direct aid to political parties.Final approval -- on a 64-35 roll call -- was never in doubt

Those who bought that illusion are now bewildered.Eight months after Gen. Boris Gromov walked across the bridge into the U.S.S.R., a Soviet-controlled regime remains in Kabul, the refugees sit in their camps, and the restoration of Afghan freedom seems as far off as ever
But there never was a chance that the Afghan resistance would overthrow the Kabul regime quickly and easily.Soviet leaders said they would support their Kabul clients by all means necessary -- and did.The U.S. said it would fully support the resistance -- and didn't
Soviet leaders said they would support their Kabul clients by all means necessary -- and did.The U.S. said it would fully support the resistance -- and didn't
With the February 1987 U.N. accords "relating to Afghanistan," the Soviet Union got everything it needed to consolidate permanent control.The terms of the Geneva accords leave Moscow free to provide its clients in Kabul with assistance of any kind -- including the return of Soviet ground forces -- while requiring the U.S. and Pakistan to cut off aid
The terms of the Geneva accords leave Moscow free to provide its clients in Kabul with assistance of any kind -- including the return of Soviet ground forces -- while requiring the U.S. and Pakistan to cut off aid.The only fly in the Soviet ointment was the last-minute addition of a unilateral American caveat, that U.S. aid to the resistance would continue as long as Soviet aid to Kabul did
But as soon as the accords were signed, American officials sharply reduced aid.In February 1989, when the Soviets said they had completed their pullout, the U.S. cut it further
Not so the Soviets.Gen. Gromov himself said Soviet troops expected to leave behind more than $1 billion of military equipment and installations for the Kabul regime
Gen. Gromov himself said Soviet troops expected to leave behind more than $1 billion of military equipment and installations for the Kabul regime.Since the troop withdrawal, Moscow has poured in an additional $200 to $300 million worth per month -- nearly $2 billion since February, equivalent to the total U.S. aid to the resistance in nine years
Since the troop withdrawal, Moscow has poured in an additional $200 to $300 million worth per month -- nearly $2 billion since February, equivalent to the total U.S. aid to the resistance in nine years.This includes what Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Vorontsov fetchingly called "new peaceful long-range weapons," including more than 800 SCUD missiles
By early May, Moscow had delivered, for example, 1,000 trucks, about 100 tanks, artillery and hundreds of other combat vehicles.Later that month, it added an entire tank brigade, including 120 T-72 tanks and more than 40 BMP state-of-the-art infantry fighting vehicles
Later that month, it added an entire tank brigade, including 120 T-72 tanks and more than 40 BMP state-of-the-art infantry fighting vehicles.By September, a new Reinforced Motorized Rifle Brigade with an additional 300 combat vehicles, 1,000 more trucks and 10,000 Soviet-trained Afghan troops had arrived in Kandahar
By September, a new Reinforced Motorized Rifle Brigade with an additional 300 combat vehicles, 1,000 more trucks and 10,000 Soviet-trained Afghan troops had arrived in Kandahar.In the last few weeks, Moscow has added FROG-7B missiles, the bomber version of the An-12, MiG-23BN high-altitude aircraft, MiG-29s, which can outfly Pakistan's U.S.-built F16s, and Sukhoi SU-27 fighter-bombers, which can outfly the MiG-29s
Moscow claims this is all needed to protect the Kabul regime against the guerrilla resistance.It is well-known that the regular Afghan infantry is filled with reluctant conscripts
But this is not the entire Afghan army, and it is no longer Kabul's only military force.Complete units have been trained and indoctrinated in the U.S.S.R. and other East bloc nations; 30,000 to 40,000 of these troops have returned
Complete units have been trained and indoctrinated in the U.S.S.R. and other East bloc nations; 30,000 to 40,000 of these troops have returned
In addition, the regime has established well-paid paramilitary forces totaling more than 100,000, including 35,000 Soviet-trained troops of the Interior Ministry (KHAD/WAD), which still is directed by 1,500 Soviet KGB officers.Even if not all these forces are committed to the regime, they are now dependent on it
Since 1981, Indian military advisers have been assisting the Kabul regime.In preparation for the withdrawal, Moscow, Kabul and New Delhi signed two agreements for several hundred newly civilian Indian experts to replace some of the more visible Soviet military personnel
Cuban military personnel also have been active in Afghanistan since 1979.The Soviets cut a deal with Iran: a future Iranian role in Afghanistan in exchange for Iranian support of Soviet policy
The Soviets cut a deal with Iran: a future Iranian role in Afghanistan in exchange for Iranian support of Soviet policy.The deal was symbolized by the restoration of the Shi'ite Sultan Ali Keshtmand to the Afghan prime ministry
Moreover, serious questions have been raised about the claimed withdrawal of Soviet forces.Before his assassination in 1988, President Zia of Pakistan repeatedly stated that fresh Soviet troops were being inserted into Afghanistan even as others were ostentatiously withdrawn
Before his assassination in 1988, President Zia of Pakistan repeatedly stated that fresh Soviet troops were being inserted into Afghanistan even as others were ostentatiously withdrawn.Rep. Bill McCollum (R., Fla.) reports that these included 20,000 to 30,000 Soviet Central Asian KGB Border Guards, ethnically indistinguishable from Afghans and wearing unmarked uniforms
Meanwhile, the Kabul regime is increasingly successful at portraying the resistance as bloody-minded fanatics.In this they are aided by years of American, European, Pakistani and Saudi support for the most extreme factions -- radical Islamic fanatics with leaders whose policies are anathema to the Afghan public
In this they are aided by years of American, European, Pakistani and Saudi support for the most extreme factions -- radical Islamic fanatics with leaders whose policies are anathema to the Afghan public.This heavy outside support for the worst has undermined better, moderate leaders
At the last minute, however, Pakistani officials sent in Gulbuddin Hekhmatyar, perhaps the most hated and feared of the extremists, with a demand that the surrender be made to his forces.The deal fell through, and Kandahar remains a major regime base
The resistance lacks not only air power, armor and expertise but often such essentials as maps, mine detectors, or even winter gloves.Experienced resistance commanders wanted to use guerrilla action and siege tactics to wear down the regime
Instead, they were pressured by Pakistan's ISI, the channel for their support, into attacking Jalalabad.They took more than 25% casualties; journalists report that they faced minefields without mine detectors

but it is not clear how much is being sent or when it will arrive.For months the resistance has been defenseless against air attack
For months the resistance has been defenseless against air attack.Thus far there is no indication that they have been re-supplied with Stingers or other anti-aircraft weapons
Indeed, U.S. officials have indicated to the press that the continuation of aid depends on what success the weakened resistance achieves by the end of this year.Moscow and Kabul must have found that information useful
For a decade U.S. policy has been incoherent, based on miscalculation and the defense of bureaucratic and political turf.No settlement negotiated by others can force the Afghan people to give up their struggle

It isn't surprising that President Bush hasn't led a crusade to pump up the Contras or SDI. Though he nominally supports both programs, Mr. Bush hasn't been a passionate champion of either cause, as Mr. Reagan was
What's surprising is that there isn't more of a conservative outcry as the Bush administration lets the programs slip down the national-priority list.A combination of factors -- a weariness among some conservatives, a decline in the perception of a Soviet threat and a preoccupation with other issues -- seem to explain the strange tranquility
But it's like kicking your father in the pants.You hate to do it because he's your father
You hate to do it because he's your father.conservatives' unhappiness with Mr. Bush's cautious handling of the recent unsuccessful coup in Panama will make them more willing to speak out
Of course, neither President Bush nor the Congress has actually abandoned the Contras or SDI. Mr. Bush has struck a deal with congressional leaders to provide nonlethal aid to the Contras until Nicaragua holds national elections next February
and after the February election their future in any form will be murky at best.Instead of focusing on the Contras, Mr. Bush has switched to urging members of Congress to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of Nicaragua's Sandinista government
But the strong pitch by Mr. Cheney may be too little too late to prevent damage to SDI.The House has already voted for a deep cut in funding
More ominous to SDI supporters, the Bush administration appears to have tacitly accepted a new arms-control proposal from the Soviet Union that spells long-term trouble for Star Wars.The Soviets have agreed to complete a treaty cutting strategic weapons without including restrictions on space-based defenses
some conservatives may simply be so pleased that their anti-communist philosophy is prevailing that they don't have the fire at the moment to push controversial programs. "The short of it is that the most hard-bitten among us cannot get into too sour a mood with communism collapsing
One longtime champion of these programs in Congress, Republican whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, is distracted by questions about his ethics, conservatives note.Other conservative champions, like Wyoming Republican Sen. Malcolm Wallop, a longtime SDI advocate, don't have the clout with the Bush White House that they enjoyed with President Reagan
neither the Contra nor the SDI cause can be pushed much further without more presidential support. "For there to be wind in the sails of any program, the chief executive has to be blowing in the sails
All this causes Rep. Hyde to muse about an alternate way to drum up more enthusiasm. "What I'd like to see, if he is up to it, is for Reagan to take to the hustings to regenerate enthusiasm for SDI," the congressman says
We're sorry to report that on Monday President Bush accepted the resignation of William Allen as chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission.Mr. Allen, appointed by President Reagan, grew understandably tired of dealing with the guerrilla tactics of his enemies
His recent speech caused an uproar when its title leaked out.Mr. Allen's commissioners voted to call his unread speech "thoughtless, disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory
Mr. Allen's commissioners voted to call his unread speech "thoughtless, disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory." Commissioner Mary Francis Berry said it was "another sad episode in the saga of the unguided missile who is chairman

Commissioner Mary Francis Berry said it was "another sad episode in the saga of the unguided missile who is chairman." Rep. Don Edwards, the California Democrat, warned Mr. Allen that the speech would be "outside the scope of the commission's jurisdiction." Thomas Stoddard, head of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, called the prospect of the speech "frankly shocking
Mr. Allen began it with a warning to his hosts, a California church group that opposes rights for homosexuals.He said that other participants in the conference "do not believe that the rights of Americans should be guaranteed to citizens who are homosexual," but that "I mean to persuade you to the opposite view
He recalled to the audience a "strange, infelicitous" analogy he once heard arguing "now that we have finally recognized that American blacks have rights, we need to do the same for animals." Mr. Allen objected to this analogy because it seems to "assimilate the status of blacks to that of animals -- as a mere project of charity, of humaneness
because it seems to "assimilate the status of blacks to that of animals -- as a mere project of charity, of humaneness." Rights on such a basis, whether for blacks or homosexuals, are "mere indulgences
the title of his speech was to make his point that Americans have rights as individuals, not as members of certain select groups.His speech criticized the "idiocy of notions of protected groups in society" as opposed to individual equality
His speech criticized the "idiocy of notions of protected groups in society" as opposed to individual equality or, as he put it, in "a common destiny as Americans." Instead of lobbying for special treatment that homosexuals and others should try to ensure equal treatment under the law and not aim for special privileges that would risk "invidious retrenchment with government complicity
This hardly sounds like an anti-homosexual screed.What's really going on here
The three most important things to understand about Mr. Allen is that he is a black conservative intellectual -- a triple threat to the liberal establishment.Mr. Allen, who teaches government at prestigious Harvey Mudd College in California and will remain a member of the commission, has spent years arguing that civil rights are individuals' rights

He last made waves when he dared to defend an Indian girl who had been adopted by non-Indian parents off her reservation.Mr. Allen quickly ran up against the liberal establishment again, which somehow elevated the vague concept of "Indian rights" above the rights of individual Indians

However, they said the company's flat revenue was a disappointment, and an indication that sales of Polaroid's new conventional film in the U.S. have been sluggish.Revenue in the third quarter was $437.7 million, almost unchanged from $436.3 million a year earlier
Polaroid reported operating profit before taxes and interest costs of $63.1 million for the third quarter, more than double the year-before $24 million.Charges for staff cuts and other restructuring produced a net loss of $54.1 million, or 77 cents a share, in 1988's third quarter

If you believe that a good performance next year is contingent on an acceleration of revenue, there isn't a lot here to base optimism on.Polaroid officials told him yesterday that U.S. sales of the company's new conventional film product, introduced in the second quarter, have been "disappointing" after a promising start

Before the 1987 crash, an estimated $60 billion in institutional money was managed under this hedging technique.The idea was to "insure" the value of a portfolio by selling futures when stock prices dropped
Yet even today, institutions are quietly practicing forms of portfolio insurance by nervously rushing to and fro in the markets.Others are doing "index arbitrage"a strategy of taking advantage of price discrepancies between stocks and futures

Some people tend to ignore that a 50-point move is less in percentage terms than it was when the stock market was lower.John J. Phelan Jr., chairman of the Big Board, asserts that "1988 and 1989 have been two of the least volatile years in the last 30 or 40 years
Some people think the search for liquidity is fruitless.In 1936, John Maynard Keynes wrote that "of the maxims of orthodox finance none, surely, is more antisocial than the fetish of liquidity
that "of the maxims of orthodox finance none, surely, is more antisocial than the fetish of liquidity." It leads investors to focus on short-term price movements rather than on long-term fundamental valuation
Charles Redmond, a NASA spokesman, said the agency discovered the virus on Monday on the collection of computer networks collectively called Internet and expected 100 university centers to be infected by today.Although the network isn't connected to the computer systems that operate either Galileo or the shuttle, part of the network will carry analyses of Galileo data once the craft gets spaceborn
Mr. Redmond said the intruder hadn't yet done any harm but the agency feared "garbage data could be substituted for real data." He estimated it could take a day for a computer security manager to expunge the virus from a computer system
The intruder, among the broadest yet to hit a research network, appeared to affect only Digital Equipment Corp. hardware that uses Digital's VAX/VMS operating system.It is unrelated to the much-publicized virus that last year infected Arpanet, a much larger network used by researchers at universities, laboratories and government agencies around the world
In the lingo of computer security, the NASA intruder is technically a computer worm, Mr. Redmond said.A worm resides in the operating system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks
A worm resides in the operating system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks.The Galileo worm apparently was hatched on a computer in France hooked up to NASA's Space Physics Analysis Network, Mr. Redmond said
that the worm gets into a computer center by looking for obvious passwords -- such as ones that are the same as the user's name.If it finds one and gets into the system, it will display a screen when a user logs on that says, "Worms Against Nuclear Killers. . . . You talk of times of peace for all, and then prepare for war
The worm also looks for elementary passwords that confer more privileges on the user.The passwords are included in the system software when it is installed but are supposed to be replaced as soon as the system is up and running
The worm also looks for elementary passwords that confer more privileges on the user.The passwords are included in the system software when it is installed but are supposed to be replaced as soon as the system is up and running.If it finds one of those passwords, Mr. Alexander said, the worm will do such things as change users' passwords to a series of random numbers, preventing them from signing on to the network
that, on Monday, about four computer centers were affected.Yesterday, the number grew to 40
Yesterday, the number grew to 40; today the number is expected to grow to 100
today the number is expected to grow to 100.NASA said it will take about a week before it knows exactly how many centers of the 6,000 connected to Internet were affected and the extent of the damage, if any
Anti-nuclear activists have protested the launch of the Galileo space probe to Jupiter because it uses plutonium to generate the electricity needed to run the craft.that if the shuttle carrying Galileo into orbit should explode, or if Galileo itself crashes into the Earth during the two times it flies close to the planet, fatal levels of plutonium would be released into the atmosphere
So far Galileo has been delayed twice.the Galileo worm had nothing to do with either delay
hackers have gone after SPAN before.He said the Chaos Computer Club, of West Germany, once managed to invade SPAN and do such things as change the value of pi, messing up some calculations
Yet it is also axiomatic that the power to create new crimes belongs only to the legislature, and not to courts.Beginning in the early 19th century, with U.S. v.Hudson and Goodwin, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a judicial power to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal, while well established in British law, would usurp legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers
it has never been statutorily defined.In 1983, the Supreme Court tried to supply a workable definition in the Dirks v.SEC decision
Gradually, however, lower courts and prosecutors have pushed this definition to its breaking point.Consider the facts underlying the 1989 conviction of Robert Chestman
Prior to a tender offer by A&P for Waldbaum Inc. in 1986, the founder of the Waldbaum's supermarket chain called an elderly relative to tell her to assemble her stock certificates for delivery.She called her daughter to take her to the bank, who, in turn, persuaded her husband, a Mr. Loeb, to run this errand

She called her daughter to take her to the bank, who, in turn, persuaded her husband, a Mr. Loeb, to run this errand.Hearing of this information, the husband discussed it with his broker, Mr. Chestman, and Mr. Chestman then bought for his own account and other clients.Basically, Mr. Chestman was a fourth-level tippee

A second illustration is supplied by the recent guilty plea entered by Robert Freeman, formerly head of arbitrage at Goldman, Sachs & Co. Essentially, Mr. Freeman had invested heavily in the Beatrice leveraged buy-out, when he was told by another prominent trader, Bernard "Bunny" Lasker, that the deal was in trouble.After placing orders to sell, Mr. Freeman called Martin Siegel, an investment banker at Kidder, Peabody & Co., who was advising on the deal, to confirm these rumors.Mr. Siegel asked Mr. Freeman who his source was and, on hearing that it was Bunny Lasker, responded: "Well, your bunny has a good nose

After placing orders to sell, Mr. Freeman called Martin Siegel, an investment banker at Kidder, Peabody & Co., who was advising on the deal, to confirm these rumors.Mr. Siegel asked Mr. Freeman who his source was
The illegal "tip" of the bunny's good nose was then largely a confirmation of rumors already known to many in the market.Had the case gone to trial the same issues would have surfaced: Was there a fiduciary breach in order to obtain personal gain
It is not my contention that either Mr. Chestman or Mr. Freeman was an innocent victim of prosecutorial overzealousness.Arguably, both were on notice that their behavior was at least risky
Courts and legislatures make decisions in very different ways and are each susceptible to very different kinds of errors.After-the-fact judicial examination of an actor's conduct has always been the common law's method
After-the-fact judicial examination of an actor's conduct has always been the common law's method.When only civil liability is involved, this method has the undeniable strengths of factual specificity and avoidance of overgeneralization
Still, case-by-case retrospective decision making of this sort is vulnerable to the tunnel vision caused by a fixation on ad hoc (and usually sleazy) examples.When a court decides that a particular actor's conduct was culpable and so extends the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct, it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that will be covered by the expanded rule
In the past, not only would reputable professionals have rushed to check out such rumors with the company, but companies listed on the major stock exchanges were encouraged by the exchanges to respond openly to such inquiries from securities analysts.Today, after Mr. Freeman's plea, there is an uncertainty that is both unfair and inefficient
The federal mail and wire fraud statutes provide even better illustrations of the rapid evolution of a federal common law of white-collar crime.In 1987, the Supreme Court attempted in McNally v.U.S. to halt the inexorable expansion of these statutes by adopting a rule of strict construction for ambiguous criminal statues.Yet, late last year, Congress effectively reversed this decision by enacting a one-sentence statute that defined fraud to include any scheme to deprive another of "the intangible right of honest services." At a stroke, this may criminalize all fiduciary breaches (and possibly all misrepresentations by an agent or employee
Yet, late last year, Congress effectively reversed this decision by enacting a one-sentence statute that defined fraud to include any scheme to deprive another of "the intangible right of honest services." At a stroke, this may criminalize all fiduciary breaches
Such a statute illustrates the fundamental problem: Congress finds it is easier to pass sweepingly moralistic prohibitions, which the courts must thereafter interpret, than to engage in the difficult line-drawing distinctions that are inherently its responsibility.We are confronted less with a judicial power grab than with a legislative giveaway
We are confronted less with a judicial power grab than with a legislative giveaway.Predictably, when confronted with morally dubious behavior, prosecutors will exploit the latitude such openended statutes give them

Average yields on CDs aimed at individual investors fell less than half as much as yields on Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction.Six-month CDs of $50,000 and less yielded an average 8.02% in the week ended Tuesday, down from 8.10%, according to Banxquote.The yield on six-month T-bills fell to 7.82% on Monday, from 8.01% the week before

Meanwhile, the average yield on six-month CDs of more than $90,000 fell to 7.93% in the latest week, according to Banxquote, from 8.10% the week before.that actual rates are almost identical on small and large-denomination CDs, but yields on CDs aimed at the individual investor are boosted by more frequent compounding
A six-month, broker-sold CD, for example, was yielding an average 8.09% in the latest week, a fifth of a percentage point lower than the week before.In late April, when interest rates were at their recent highs, short-term CDs sold by brokers were offering yields half a percentage point or more higher than banks
CD yields are generally expected to fall further in coming weeks. "What happened in the stock market and the bigger trade deficit" reported yesterday "make it unlikely that short-term interest rates will rise" any time soon
Even before the market drop, rates were down about half a percentage point.That puts pressure on CD rates
Conservatives have an important decision to make this fall.At the recent meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, the Bush administration announced its intention to decide by yearend the size of the next increase in the IMF's capital base
At the recent meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, the Bush administration announced its intention to decide by yearend the size of the next increase in the IMF's capital base.While the U.S. share of the increase probably will not reach the $12 billion or more implicit in the IMF's request for a doubling of its $90 billion capital, the administration probably will agree to a multibillion-dollar increase
the administration probably will agree to a multibillion-dollar increase.This would be consistent with its unwavering support for the Brady Plan and G-7 exchange-rate intervention, and with its financial commitment to Mexico, Poland and others
The IMF has several reasons for requesting the increase.Its role in the economies of developing countries has grown steadily since the 1970s
Its role in the economies of developing countries has grown steadily since the 1970s.The size and pace of disbursements will accelerate further under the Brady Plan, which promises larger and earlier disbursements to approved countries
Third, the IMF would like to meet Japan's request for increased ownership (currently 4.5%).Japan has supported a larger role for the IMF in developing-country debt issues, and is an important financial resource for IMF-guided programs in developing countries
there is a clear economic case against it.Opponents of the increase argue that the IMF practices central planning while supporting ineffective governments

Decisions on increases in the IMF's capital base traditionally are made by the administration, with subsequent authorization by Congress.The last U.S. congressional authorization, in 1983, was a political donnybrook and carried a $6 billion housing program along with it to secure adequate votes
The politics of the 1990 congressional authorization are likely to be similar to those of previous authorizations.Liberals may support the stabilizing, quasi-governmental role of the IMF on two conditions: that the administration give assurances that liberal Democrats' support will not be used against them in congressional re-election campaigns; and that the legislation address -- with dollars -- social and environmental concerns.Conservative Republicans will be given the choice of supporting or fighting their party's popular president in an election year

A U.S. decision to refuse the IMF its capital increase, or limit it to 25%, would bring a major change in international economic policy, and could not be taken lightly.Commentators would fret over the implications for the G-7 coordination process and the stability of world financial markets
Commentators would fret over the implications for the G-7 coordination process and the stability of world financial markets.Because commercial banks and the developing-country governments believe they will get a piece of any capital increase, a scaled-down IMF mission would leave both feeling shortchanged
On the other hand, a decision to increase the IMF's capital would reinforce the central economic role of multilateral institutions in developing countries.With the increase, even more developing-country energy and talent would be diverted from creating profitable economic systems to setting up economic planning ministries that generate IMF-approved economic plans
With the increase, even more developing-country energy and talent would be diverted from creating profitable economic systems to setting up economic planning ministries that generate IMF-approved economic plans.Upping the ante could slow economic development even further, as countries delay market-opening steps in anticipation of richer multilateral support
Conservatives should take a position prior to the administration's year-end deadline.The issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget ministries fighting over the size of the capital increase, rather than its purpose
The issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget ministries fighting over the size of the capital increase, rather than its purpose.If conservatives don't support an increase in the IMF's capital, then it is incumbent on them to speak up now and explain the alternative

The purchase comes after nearly three years of on-again off-again talks between TCI and Viacom, which has also discussed the sale of an interest in Showtime with other cable operators.Showtime is a distant No. 2 to Home Box Office, and in May filed a $2.5 billion antitrust suit against Time Warner, charging the company and its HBO and American Television cable units with conspiring to monopolize the pay TV business
and has been eager to keep Showtime as a healthy competitor. "It is important to the cable industry that we have a vibrant and competitive pay-television marketplace
Showtime's suit against HBO "doesn't involve us, and nothing we're doing here bears any relationship to that.We don't intend to be drawn into it
Linking up Showtime with the largest cable operator in the U.S. could sharply boost its subscribers.TCI said it may bring in other cable operators as investors, a practice it has employed in the past with investments in other cable networks, such as The Discovery Channel
TCI said it may bring in other cable operators as investors, a practice it has employed in the past with investments in other cable networks, such as The Discovery Channel.Additional cable partners could boost subscribers even further
Time Warner declined comment.In addition to owning HBO, Time Warner owns American Television & Communications Inc., the nation's second largest cable operator after TCI
The TCI investment is a big victory for Viacom's chief executive officer, Frank Biondi, and Winston H. Cox, president of the Showtime unit. "This takes any question of Showtime's viability and puts it away once and for all
The fight between HBO and Showtime is particularly acrimonious because Mr. Biondi is the former chief executive of HBO, and Mr. Cox served as chief of marketing for the service.They were both hired by Sumner Redstone, the Boston billionaire who took control of Viacom three years ago in a leveraged buy-out

Intelogic Trace, a computer services company, was spun off to Datapoint holders in 1985, after Mr. Edelman gained control.After Mr. Ackerman announced he was soliciting consents from shareholders in order to wrest control of Datapoint from Mr. Edelman, the corporate raider purchased 30% of Datapoint's shares
from Sept. 29 to Oct. 13, he acquired 309,500 shares of Intelogic common shares for $2.25 to $2.375 each.The purchases increased his stake to 16.2% of the shares outstanding

Yesterday, Ford Motor disclosed that it has raised its holding in Jaguar to 10.4% from 5%.Both Ford and its rival General Motors recently set their sights on grabbing significant minority stakes in the British company

But a crucial point is how Ford reacts when GM, the world's largest auto maker, firms up its proposed deal with Jaguar.At the moment, Ford executives will say little beyond reiterating their desire to raise Ford's Jaguar stake to about 15%

Couch-potato jocks watching ABC's "Monday Night Football" can now vote during halftime for the greatest play in 20 years from among four or five filmed replays.Two weeks ago, viewers of several NBC daytime consumer segments started calling a 900 number for advice on various life-style issues
and television programmers are racing to exploit the possibilities.Eventually viewers may grow bored with the technology
We've been spending a lot of time in Los Angeles talking to TV production people.With the competitiveness of the television market these days, everyone is looking for a way to get viewers more excited
One of the leaders behind the expanded use of 900 numbers is Call Interactive, a joint venture of giants American Express Co. and American Telephone & Telegraph Co. Formed in August, the venture weds AT&T's newly expanded 900 service with 200 voice-activated computers in American Express's Omaha, Neb., service center
and special consultants are springing up to exploit the new tool.Blair Entertainment has just formed a subsidiary -- 900 Blair -- to apply the technology to television
The use of 900 toll numbers has been expanding rapidly in recent years.For a while, high-cost pornography lines and services that tempt children to dial (and redial) movie or music information earned the service a somewhat sleazy image
The cost of a 900 call is set by the originator -- ABC Sports, for example -- with the cheapest starting at 75 cents.Billing is included in a caller's regular phone bill
Billing is included in a caller's regular phone bill.From the fee, the local phone company and the long-distance carrier extract their costs to carry the call, passing the rest of the money to the originator, which must cover advertising and other costs
Before, callers of 900 numbers would just listen and not talk, or they'd vote "yes" or "no" by calling one of two numbers. (People in the phone business call this technology "900 click
People in the phone business call this technology "900 click.") Now, callers are led through complex menus of choices to retrieve information they want, and the hardware can process 10,000 calls in 90 seconds
Up to now, 900 numbers have mainly been used on local TV stations and cable channels.MTV used one to give away the house that rock star Jon Bon Jovi grew up in
MTV used one to give away the house that rock star Jon Bon Jovi grew up in.For several years, Turner Broadcasting System's Cable News Network has invited viewers to respond nightly to topical issues
The newest uses of the 900-interactive technology demonstrate the growing variety of applications.Capital Cities/ABC Inc., CBS Inc. and General Electric Co. 's National Broadcasting Co. unit are expected to announce soon a joint campaign to raise awareness about hunger
Capital Cities/ABC Inc., CBS Inc. and General Electric Co. 's National Broadcasting Co. unit are expected to announce soon a joint campaign to raise awareness about hunger.The subject will be written into the plots of prime-time shows, and viewers will be given a 900 number to call
and viewers will be given a 900 number to call.Callers will be sent educational booklets, and the call's modest cost will be an immediate method of raising money
Other network applications have very different goals.ABC Sports was looking for ways to lift deflated halftime ratings for "Monday Night Football

Integrated didn't identify the party or say why the talks failed.Last week another potential buyer, Whitehall Financial Group -- which had agreed in August to purchase most of Integrated's core companies for $310 million -- ended talks with Integrated
Integrated said that it would continue to pursue "other alternatives" to sell the five core companies and that a group of senior executives plans to make a proposal to purchase three of the companies -- Integrated Resources Equity Corp., Resources Trust Co. and Integrated Resources Asset Management Corp.A price wasn't disclosed
it expects to report a second-quarter loss wider than the earlier estimate of about $600 million.the change was related to Integrated's failure to sell its core businesses, as well as "other events that occurred after its announcement last week that it was in talks with the unidentified prospective buyer

UAL stock plummeted a further $24.875 to $198 on volume of more than 2.8 million shares in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.The plunge followed a drop of $56.875 Monday, amid indications the takeover may take weeks to be revived
The stock has fallen $87.25, or 31%, in the three trading days since announcement of the collapse of the $300-a-share takeover jolted the entire stock market into its second-worst plunge ever. "This is a total bloodbath" for takeover-stock traders
Even as Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. scrambled to line up bank financing for a revised version of the lapsed labor-management bid, British Airways, a 15% partner in the buying group, indicated it wants to start from scratch.Its partners are United's pilots, who were to own 75%, and UAL management at 10%
Adding insult to injury, United's 25,000-member Machinists' union, which helped scuttle financing for the first bid, yesterday asked UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and other UAL directors to resign.A similar demand was made by a group that represents some of United's 26,000 noncontract employees

Yesterday's selling began after a Japanese news agency reported that Japanese banks, which balked at the first bid, were ready to reject a revised version at around $250 a share, or $5.65 billion.Several reports as the day progressed gave vague or conflicting indications about whether banks would sign up
In London, British Airways Chairman Lord King was quoted in the Times as declaring he is "not prepared to take my shareholders into a hasty deal." Observers said it appeared that British Air was angered at the way the bid has degenerated into confusion, as well as by the banks' effort to round up financing for what one called "a deal that isn't a deal
The effort to revive the bid was complicated by the unwieldy nature of the three-party buying group.The pilots were meeting outside Chicago yesterday
The machinists also asked for an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible securities-law violations in the original bid for UAL by Mr. Davis, as well as in the response by UAL. Last week, just before the bank commitments were due, the union asked the U.S. Labor Department to study whether the bid violated legal standards of fairness governing employee investment funds
The huge drop in UAL stock prompted one takeover stock trader, George Kellner, managing partner of Kellner, DiLeo & Co., to deny publicly rumors that his firm was going out of business.Mr. Kellner said that despite losses on UAL stock, his firm's health is "excellent
The stock's decline also has left the UAL board in a quandary.Although it may not be legally obligated to sell the company if the buy-out group can't revive its bid, it may have to explore alternatives if the buyers come back with a bid much lower than the group's original $300-a-share proposal

Currently in the middle of a four-week, 20-city tour as a solo pianist, Mr. Glass has left behind his synthesizers, equipment and collaborators in favor of going it alone.He sits down at the piano and plays
And plays.Either one likes it or one doesn't

It is music for people who want to hear something different but don't want to work especially hard at the task.It is E-Z listening for the now generation
Mr. Glass has inverted the famous modernist dictum "less is more." His more is always less
His more is always less.Far from being minimalist, the music unabatingly torments us with apparent novelties not so cleverly disguised in the simplicities of 4/4 time, octave intervals, and ragtime or gospel chord progressions
and Mr. Glass has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex. "Opening" (1981), from Glassworks, introduces the audience to the Glass technique

You might call it a leitmotif or a virtuoso accomplishment.In "Mad Rush," which came from a commission to write a piece of indeterminate length (Mr.Glass charmingly, and tellingly, confessed that "this was no problem for me"), an A section alternates with a B section several times before the piece ends unresolved
Not only is the typical Glasswork open-ended, it is also often multiple in its context(s). "Mad Rush" began its life as the accompaniment to the Dalai Lama's first public address in the U.S., when Mr. Glass played it on the organ at New York's Cathedral of St. John the Divine.Later it was performed on Radio Bremen in Germany, and then Lucinda Childs took it for one of her dance pieces

The evening ended with Mr. Glass's "Metamorphosis," another multiple work.Parts 1, 2, and 5 come from the soundtrack of Errol Morris's acclaimed film, "The Thin Blue Line," and the two other parts from incidental music to two separate dramatizations of the Kafka story of the same name
Parts 1, 2, and 5 come from the soundtrack of Errol Morris's acclaimed film, "The Thin Blue Line.When used as background in this way, the music has an appropriate eeriness, as when a two-note phrase, a descending minor third, accompanies the seemingly endless litany of reports, interviews and confessions of witnesses in the Morris film
this comparison ignores the intensely claustrophobic nature of Mr. Glass's music.Its supposedly austere minimalism overlays a bombast that makes one yearn for the astringency of neoclassical Stravinsky, the genuinely radical minimalism of Berg and Webern, and what in retrospect even seems like concision in Mahler

Once again, your editorial page misstates the law to conform to your almost beatific misperceptions.In an excursus of little relevance to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups, Michael S. Greve informs your readers, ". . . the Clean Water Act is written upon the presumption -- the pretense, rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do; it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge" ("Congress's Environmental Buccaneers," Sept. 18). This statement surely buttresses your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive, but it is simply wrong
the Clean Water Act is written upon the presumption -- the pretense, rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do; it establishes a legal standard of zero discharge
but it is simply wrong.The Clean Water Act contains no "legal standard" of zero discharge
The Clean Water Act contains no "legal standard" of zero discharge.It requires that "discharges of pollutants" into the "waters of the United States" be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under section 301
It requires that "discharges of pollutants" into the "waters of the United States" be authorized by permits that reflect the effluent limitations developed under section 301.Whatever may be the problems with this system, it scarcely reflects "zero risk" or "zero discharge
Perhaps Mr. Greve was confused by Congress's meaningless statement of "the national goal" in section 101, which indeed calls for the elimination of discharges -- by 1985, no less.This fatuous statement was not taken seriously when enacted in 1972, and should not now be confused with the operative provisions of the statute
Thus, you do the public a great disservice when Mr. Greve suggests, even facetiously, that the Clean Water Act prohibits the preparation of a scotch and water; your tippling readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them, as they cower in the night with their scotch and waters, from the hairyknuckled knock of the Sierra Club at their doors
the magazine just hasn't kept up with the times.it hasn't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine boys like to flip through in search of topless tribe women
Despite renewed interest by the public in such topics as the environment and the Third World, it hasn't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine boys like to flip through in search of topless tribe women.Worse, it lagged behind competitors in offering now-standard gimmicks, from regional editions to discounts for frequent advertisers
But now, the magazine is attempting to fight back, with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign.Advertisers don't think of the magazine first, says Joan McCraw, who joined in April as national advertising director
Advertisers don't think of the magazine first.What we want to do is take a more aggressive stance
What we want to do is take a more aggressive stance.People didn't believe we were in tune with the marketplace, and in many ways we weren't
The 101-year-old magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much fervor before.It largely rested on its hard-to-fault demographics
But this year, when the hullabaloo surrounding its centennial died, so too did some advertiser interest.The reason is that the entire magazine business has been soft -- and National Geographic has some quirks that make it especially unattractive during a soft market
Perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices.When ad dollars are tight, the high page cost is a major deterrent for advertisers
But Ms. McCraw says the magazine is fighting back.It now offers 30 regional editions, it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles, and it has been beefing up its sales force
The centerpiece of the promotion is its new ad campaign, into which the magazine will pour about $500,000, mostly in the next few weeks.The campaign, created by Omnicom Group's DDB Needham agency, takes advantage of the eye-catching photography that National Geographic is known for

The CFTC said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites "problems" associated with the practice.Dual trading gives an exchange trader the right to trade both for his own account and for customers
The issue exploded this year after a Federal Bureau of Investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange.While not specifically mentioned in the FBI charges, dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations
While not specifically mentioned in the FBI charges, dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations.Critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders' customer orders
that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they don't have a customer order in hand.liquidity becomes a severe problem for thinly traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration
The CFTC may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions.The agency didn't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed, but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them
The agency didn't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed, but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them.Wendy Gramm, the agency's chairman, told the Senate Agriculture Committee that she expects the study to be released within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed by Thanksgiving
The study, by the CFTC's division of economic analysis, shows that "a trade is a trade.Whether a trade is done on a dual or non-dual basis doesn't seem to have much economic impact
Currently, most traders on commodity exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts, which makes them brokers, or for their own accounts as socalled locals. "The tests indicate that dual and non-dual traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market," Mrs. Gramm told the Senate panel
Members of Congress have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to reauthorize CFTC operations.The House's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000 contracts or more
The House's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of 7,000 contracts or more.The Senate bill would force the CFTC to suspend dual trading if an exchange can't show that its oversight system can detect dual-trading abuses
So far, one test of restricting dual trading has worked well.The Chicago Merc banned dual trading in its Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures pit in 1987.Under the rules, traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers.Traders who stand on the pit's top step, where most customer orders are executed, can't trade for themselves. A Merc spokesman said the plan hasn't made much difference in liquidity in the pit

that every dealer construct and furnish a building in a Japanese style.Specifications include a polished bronze sculpture at the center of each showroom and a tile bridge spanning a stream that flows into the building from outside
But only two-thirds of Lexus dealers are constructing new buildings according to the Lexus specs.Some are even coming up with their own novel designs
Yet some dealers have turned down Infiniti or Lexus franchises because they were unwilling or unable to meet the design requirements.Infiniti "was a bear on interiors" but at least let him retrofit an existing building -- without the stream

Dictaphone Corp. was caught off guard in 1974 when its main competitor, Lanier Office Products of Japan, introduced a microcassette dictation recorder half the size of standard cassette devices.Blocked by patent protection from following suit, Dictaphone decided to go a step further and cut the cassette in half again -- down to the length of a paperclip
Blocked by patent protection from following suit, Dictaphone decided to go a step further and cut the cassette in half again.By 1979, designers and engineers at Dictaphone, a Pitney Bowes subsidiary, had produced a working model of a "picocassette" recorder
But others said pico should proceed.Both were right
Dictaphone went ahead and introduced the pico in 1985, but it hasn't sold well.To date it has "broken even or shown a small loss
Nevertheless, the device has been successful in other ways.It helped Dictaphone attract better engineers, and it provided new technology for other company products
Dictaphone's picocassette recorder is one of 13 case studies in the TRIAD Design Project, sponsored by the Design Management Institute of Boston and Harvard Business School.The studies are on exhibit at Harvard this month and will travel to Chicago's Institute of Design and the University of California at Berkeley
ONE DAY Carl Barrett of Mobile, Ala., was raking some sycamore leaves, but the rake kept riding up over the piles.The harder he tried to push them into large piles, the closer he came to breaking the rake and straining his back
So Mr. Barrett, then vice president of the Alabama Steamship Association, took a steel-toothed garden rake and taped it to the underside of a leaf rake about nine inches up.His crude device worked
His crude device worked: The lower teeth gathered the leaves into a pile, while the higher, harder teeth moved the top of the pile

At the moment, however, the painting is a nagging reminder of the problems that have engulfed CenTrust and its flamboyant chairman and chief executive, David L. Paul.In an international buying spree that began barely two years ago, Mr. Paul amassed a collection of about 30 pre-18th-century works, including the Preti, at a total cost of $28 million. By midnight Oct. 6, all of the paintings were supposed to have been sold off, under orders from Florida's comptroller, whose office regulates the state's S&Ls.CenTrust didn't meet the deadline. The collection was at the heart of a grandiose plan Mr. Paul had in which the art was to do double duty -- as an investment for CenTrust and as decoration for the S&L's new office tower, designed by I.M. Pei.The rub is that the $28 million was plucked from the funds of this federally insured institution even as CenTrust was losing money hand over fist.Mr. Paul had no right to buy art for the S&L in the first place -- it isn't on the comptroller's "permissible" list -- without seeking a special dispensation, which he did not do.Besides that, some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of CenTrust actually ended up hanging in the chairman's estate on La Gorce Isle off Miami Beach

He established his reputation as a freespender in January last year at Sotheby's auction of the Linda and Gerald Guterman collection in New York.There, on one of his first shopping trips, Mr. Paul picked up several paintings at stunning prices

For several months, there was optimism all around.Last October, Mr. Paul paid out $12 million of CenTrust's cash -- plus a $1.2 million commission -- for "Portrait of a Man as Mars
Last October, Mr. Paul paid out $12 million of CenTrust's cash -- plus a $1.2 million commission -- for "Portrait of a Man as Mars." The painting, attributed to Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens, was purchased privately through Sotheby's, not at auction
In March 1989, just 15 months into his campaign, Mr. Paul was named by Art & Antiques magazine as one of the top 100 individual collectors in the U.S. "An unknown quantity to most of the art world, Paul is no stranger to lavish spending," the magazine said
that he doesn't stop at paint on canvas but also spends big on art you can eat. "He recently bid $30,000 at a Paris charity auction for a dinner cooked by six of the world's great chefs, but the final party cost closer to $100,000

The state gave CenTrust 30 days to sell the Rubens.The comptroller's office eventually extended the deadline to six months but broadened its demands, ordering that the "book value of the collection {be} reduced to zero
In other words: Get rid of all the pictures.The state obliquely noted that unsafe banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director
that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at Sotheby's.that he was "merely storing the paintings at home -- with some display -- because of the special dehumidified environment" required for their safekeeping, until CenTrust's new building was ready for them
For instance, he got a $3 million loan from the S&L, negotiated at a below-market rate.He owns 43% of CenTrust's shares
The $12 million lavished on the Rubens, for example, was a record price for the artist and maybe twice its value, given a dispute among scholars about its provenance.scholars question the authenticity of the Rubens

Still, predicting is tricky. "I'm forever dumbfounded by what I see making these high prices
Jonathan H. Kress, the son of the painting's former owner, Mrs. Rush Kress, dismisses the price talk as "sour grapes." Dealers contemptuous of the purchase price were themselves interested in buying the Rubens but lost out
a lot of the experts have never seen the thing itself. "Most of them weren't even born the last time the painting was displayed publicly
Art prices are skyrocketing, but a good deal of legerdemain is involved in compiling statistics on sales.Salomon Brothers Inc., the investment-banking firm, in its annual tally of investment returns, reported that old masters appreciated 51% in the year ended June 1, the greatest return of any of 13 assets it tracked
Salomon Brothers Inc., the investment-banking firm, in its annual tally of investment returns, reported that old masters appreciated 51% in the year ended June 1, the greatest return of any of 13 assets it tracked.

Also, at any of Sotheby's auctions of old masters, roughly one-third to one-fifth of what is offered doesn't sell at any price.It's not that there aren't any bids, but the bids don't meet the minimum "reserve" prices set by the sellers
But from his vantage point, it isn't that Mr. Paul, a customer of his too, overpaid for the work, "a gargantuan painting by an artist who is not a household word." (The painting is 10 feet wide, seven feet high

and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential buyer could be." Frequently, clients express interest in paintings but don't end up bidding
Mr. Paul, in selling off his paintings, is seeking at least a 15% return on the bank's investment, so as to prove that the venture was sound.Mr. Paul says that he has feelers out over much of the globe and that potential buyers from as far away as Japan and Italy have examined the collection

The new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) was created in 1972 to replace the Accounting Principles Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.All of the former board's members were CPAs, provoking conflict-of-interest criticism because they were writing rules while handling clients' books at the same time
Francis M. Wheat, a former Securities and Exchange Commission member, headed the panel that had studied the issues for a year and proposed the FASB on March 30, 1972.The former board had produced "21 opinions and 1,000 critics" in its 12-year life, its chairman had conceded
The climate was right for the new FASB.In the late 1960s some CPAs failed to correct such abuses as clients picking permissive rules that hyped earnings and stock prices
Also, James Needham, an SEC commissioner, in April 1972 had warned that the industry might face a "federal agency writing accounting rules" if they rejected the FASB idea.Keepers of the books, dubbed "figure filberts," loathed the threat

The new technology radically reduces the costs of making flat-rolled sheets.the company's plant eventually will make a ton of steel in 1.5 man hours, compared with four to six man hours at a conventional mill
We've had the Russians and Chinese, and people from India visiting us.Everyone in the world is watching us very closely
Especially his neighbors, the major U.S. steelmakers.Already, USX Corp. and Armco Inc. are studying Nucor's technology to see if they can adopt it
Already, USX Corp. and Armco Inc. are studying Nucor's technology to see if they can adopt it.It's damn worrisome
The once-staid steel industry is about to be turned topsy-turvy by a 1990s technology revolution.New, efficient and sophisticated processes make it easier for smaller, less cash-rich companies to make steel at a fraction of what Big Steel paid decades ago
But such thin-slab technology is only the beginning.Eager engineers espouse direct-steelmaking and direct casting, which by the end of the 1990s will enable production without coke ovens and blast furnaces
Eager engineers espouse direct-steelmaking and direct casting, which by the end of the 1990s will enable production without coke ovens and blast furnaces.Those massive structures effectively locked out all but deep-pocketed giants from steelmaking
But that won't suffice. "It's no longer enough to beat the guy down the street
It's no longer enough to beat the guy down the street.You have to beat everyone around the world
You have to beat everyone around the world.He wants to see steelmakers more involved in computers and artificial intelligence
The technology revolution is going to be very threatening to established producers.They've got too much invested in the old stuff
minimills to eclipse major integrated steelmakers.Nucor's plant in Crawfordsville, Ind., ultimately will produce only one million tons annually, a drop in the 40-million-ton-a-year flat-rolled steel bucket
Moreover, the process isn't without its headaches.Because all operations are connected, one equipment failure forces a complete plant shutdown
one equipment failure forces a complete plant shutdown.On some days, the Nucor plant doesn't produce anything
Indeed, with demand for steel not growing fast enough to absorb capacity, steelmakers will have to change the way they do business.In the past steelmakers made a product and set it out on the loading dock
In the past steelmakers made a product and set it out on the loading dock. "We said: `We've got a product: if you want it, you can buy it

Armco's sales representatives visit the General Motors Corp. 's Fairfax assembly plant in Kansas City, Mo., two or three days a week.When they determined that GM needed parts more quickly, Armco convinced a steel service center to build a processing plant nearby so shipments could be delivered within 15 minutes
But steelmakers must also find new markets.After letting aluminum-makers take the recycling lead, a group of the nation's largest steelmakers started a recycling institute to promote steel cans to an environmentally conscious nation
Weirton Steel Corp., Weirton, W. Va., for example, is touting to homeowners fashionable steel doors, with leaded glass inserts, as a secure and energy-efficient alternative to wooden or aluminum ones.Other steelmakers envision steel roofs covering suburbia
Still others are looking at overseas markets.USX is funneling drilling pipe to steel-hungry Soviet Union
USX is funneling drilling pipe to steel-hungry Soviet Union.This year, the nation's largest steelmaker reactivated its overseas sales operation
Producers also are trying to differentiate by concentrating on higher-profit output, such as coated and electrogalvanized products.Almost all capital-improvement programs announced by major steelmakers within the past year involve building electrogalvanizing lines
But unfortunately, that segment is much smaller than the bread-and-butter flat-rolled steel. "It's like everyone climbing out of the QE II and getting into a lifeboat

Robert Crandall, with the Brookings Institute, agrees. "Unless there is an enormous rate of economic growth or a further drop in the dollar, it's unlikely that consumption of U.S. produced steel will grow sufficiently to offset the growth of minimills
Not to mention the incursion of imports.Japanese and European steelmakers are anxiously awaiting the lifting of trade restraints in 1992
Moreover, the U.S. can expect more competition from low-cost producing Pacific Rim and Latin American countries.A Taiwanese steelmaker recently announced plans to build a Nucor-like plant
People think of the steel business as an old and mundane smokestack business.They're dead wrong
Kodak will be ordered to pay $1 billion to $1.5 billion for infringing on seven Polaroid patents.That may be the largest patent award ever, but it is well below the $12 billion Polaroid seeks
Few analysts think it is worth their time to slog through the Polaroid trial testimony. "It's like panning for gold outside of Grand Central Station
It's like panning for gold outside of Grand Central Station.You might find something, but the chances are low
A 75-day trial in the early 1980s determined that Kodak, based in Rochester, N.Y., infringed on patents of Polaroid, of Cambridge, Mass.The main issues remaining are how to calculate damages and whether the infringement was "willful and deliberate
and whether the infringement was "willful and deliberate." If so, the damages could be tripled
testimony by Kodak's patent counsel, Francis T. Carr of Kenyon & Kenyon, showed that "he worked with Kodak continuously from the outset of the project" in an effort to avoid infringement. "Carr told Kodak on many occasions to avoid various features because of Polaroid's patent positions," and Kodak followed his advice in every instance
the fact that seven patents were infringed "suggests that infringement was willful.It's difficult to be that consistently wrong
because it would result in a larger award.it could have manufactured and sold all the instant cameras and film sold by Kodak if Kodak hadn't entered the market
Each side has called a Harvard Business School professor to testify on that issue.Kodak hired Robert Buzzell and Polaroid brought in Robert J. Dolan

Securities analysts, however, remained downbeat. "I think 1990 will be another mediocre year," said Steve Milunovich of First Boston
Jay Stevens of Dean Witter actually cut his per-share earnings estimate to $9 from $9.50 for 1989 and to $9.50 from $10.35 in 1990 because he decided sales would be even weaker than he had expected.Both estimates would mark declines from the 1988 net of $5.81 billion, or $9.80 a share, which itself was well below the record IBM set in 1984
Mr. Stevens said he kept a "buy/hold" recommendation on the stock only because "all the damage has been done." He said the stock hasn't traded below 1 1/2 times book value over the past 10 years, which at the moment computes to a stock price of $100

But several weeks ago, in the wake of the Beijing killings, the loan was canceled, according to bankers and executives close to the project.Asia Development and Schroders declined to comment on the move
The decision to cancel the loan exemplifies the tough attitude bankers have taken toward China since June 4.international lenders remain nervous about China's economic troubles and foreign debt -- $40 billion at the end of 1988
Many loans are being renegotiated, especially those tied to the hotel sector, which has been hit hard by a post-June 4 tourism slump.Many bankers view property-sector loans as particularly risky

When the loan agreement was announced, it was hailed as one of the first Western-style financing transactions ever used in China.Unlike most loans to China, there was no Chinese guarantor

Traders nervously watching their Quotron electronic-data machines yesterday morning were stunned to see the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummet 99 points in seconds.A minute later it soared 128 points
It was crazy.It was like flying without a pilot in the front of the plane
But those who said "This can't be happening" were right.The Quotrons were wrong
Quotron Systems Inc., a Citicorp unit, blamed the 30-minute foul-up on "a timing problem in our software" caused by the enormous early volume.The prices of the individual stocks that make up the average were correct but the average was wrong
Meanwhile, there was an awful lot of confusion.At about 10:40 a.m. on the over-the-counter trading desk at a major brokerage firm, a veteran trader who buys and sells some of the most active stocks looked at a senior official and asked, "What's going on?Is the market up or down

Ms. Parks's mother also gets to cuff Mr. Alexander.So does Mr. Friend and his law partner, Nick Nichols
The bizarre arrangement grows out of Mr. Alexander's representation of Derr Construction Co., one of several defendants in a wrongful death lawsuit brought by Ms. Parks, the widow of a construction worker killed in January 1987 while working on a new Houston convention center.Last month, Mr. Friend says, Mr. Alexander's associate agreed that Derr would pay $50,000 as part of an overall settlement
But Mr. Alexander scuttled the deal at the last minute, angering the plaintiff's side. "I never agreed to it," Mr. Alexander says, adding that "it's not necessary to pay these nuisance settlements

The S&P 500 futures contract, which moves in fractions of an index point under normal conditions, jumped two to three points in seconds early yesterday after an initial downturn, then moved strongly higher the rest of the day.Each index point represents a $500 profit for each S&P 500 contract held
Each index point represents a $500 profit for each S&P 500 contract held.For the first time since the 1987 crash, traders said that they were able to trade several hundred S&P 500 contracts at a time in a highly liquid market
Many institutions and individual investors have shied away from stock-index futures, blaming them for speeding the stock market crash on Black Monday two years ago.Since the crash, many futures traders haven't assumed large positions for fear that the S&P 500 market, with much of its customer order flow missing, would dry up if prices turned against them
More than 400 traders jammed the S&P 500 futures pit to await the opening bell.Traders were shouting bids and offers a full five minutes before the start of trading at 8:30 am
But several traders quickly stepped up and bid for contracts, driving prices sharply higher.The market hovered near Friday's closing price of 328.85 for about a half hour, moving several index points higher or lower in seconds, then broke higher and didn't look back
Traders five feet from each other were making bids and offers that were a full point apart.You could buy at the bid and sell at the offer and make a fortune
Several of Wall Street's largest securities firms, including Salomon Brothers Inc. and PaineWebber Inc., were also large buyers.Salomon Brothers was among the largest sellers of stock-index futures last week

No trading existed for the vast majority of junk bonds.On Friday, trading in practically every issue ground to a halt as potential buyers fled and brokerage firms were unwilling to provide bid and offer prices for most issues
I was prepared to be in a very bad mood tonight.Now, I feel maybe there's a little bit of euphoria
Analysts are concerned that much of the high-yield market will remain treacherous for investors.Paul Asquith, associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of Management, citing a pattern of junk-bond default rates that are low in the early years after issuance and rise later, says, "We're now in a period where we're starting to see defaults from the big issue years of 1984 to 1986
Junk bonds are a highly stratified market.There's a whole bunch of stuff that's money good and a whole bunch of stuff that's not so good
Analysts at Standard & Poor's say junk bond offerings by "tightly stretched" issuers seem to be growing.Almost $8 billion of junk bonds that are considered untradeable include issues from SCI TV, Gillette Holdings (not related to Gillette Co.), Interco, Seaman Furniture, Allied Stores, Federated Department Stores, National Gypsum, M.D.C. Holdings, Micropolis, Leaseway Transportation and Price Communications
You could still have some very bad times ahead.It's possible to have a 10% default rate in one year, because we're already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy
It's possible to have a 10% default rate in one year, because we're already seeing big problems in the midst of a pretty strong economy.I'm certainly not comfortable saying we've seen the bottom
But yesterday's rally among "good" junk was a badly needed tonic for the market.Many issues "bounced off the floor and benchmark junk issues "recovered all of their losses" from Friday and early yesterday

he was dropping it "in light of the recent change in market conditions." He said he might now sell his AMR stake, buy more shares, or make another offer at a lower price
UAL tumbled $56.875 to $222.875 on volume of 2.3 million shares, and AMR declined by $22.125 to $76.50 as 4.7 million shares changed hands.Together, the two stocks wreaked havoc among takeover stock traders, and caused a 7.3% drop in the Dow Jones Transportation Average, second in size only to the stock-market crash of Oct. 19, 1987
that showed signs of stalling even before problems emerged with the UAL deal.After reaching an intraday high of $107.50 the day Mr. Trump disclosed his bid Oct. 5, AMR's stock had retreated as low as $97.75 last week

Mr. Trump withdrew his bid before the AMR board ever formally considered it.AMR had weighed a wide range of possible responses, from flat rejection to recapitalizations and leveraged buy-outs that might have included either employees, a friendlier buyer such as Texas billionaire Robert Bass, or both
AMR had also sought to foil Mr. Trump in Congress by lobbying for legislation that would have bolstered the authority of the Transportation Department to reject airline buy-outs.Yesterday, Mr. Trump tried to put the blame for the collapse of the UAL deal on Congress, saying it was rushing through a bill to protect AMR executives
However, he only received federal clearance to buy more than $15 million of the stock on Sept. 20, when the price rose $2 a share to $78.50.Between then and his bid on Oct. 5, the price fluctuated between $75.625 and $87.375
In an attempt to persuade investors that his bid wasn't just "a stock play," Mr. Trump promised last week to notify the market before selling any shares.AMR was trading at around $84 yesterday before his withdrawal announcement, then immediately fell to about $76
Some analysts said they believed Mr. Trump might come back with a lower bid.Ray Neidl of Dillon Read & Co. said Mr. Trump "is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle
Mr. Trump "is stepping back and waiting for the dust to settle.I'm sure he still wants AMR

Meanwhile, Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp., the two lead lenders on the UAL buy-out, met with other banks yesterday to determine if they would be willing to finance the buy-out at a lower price.Officials familiar with the talks said Citicorp had discussed lowering the offer to $250 a share, but said that price was a talking point and that no decision has been made
At $250 a share, the group would have to borrow about $6.1 billion from banks.The first UAL deal unraveled after Citibank and Chase couldn't raise $7.2 billion
The first UAL deal unraveled after Citibank and Chase couldn't raise $7.2 billion.Citibank and Chase had agreed to commit $3 billion, and said they were "highly confident" of raising another $4.2 billion
But other banks balked at the low interest rate and banking fees the UAL group was willing to pay them.the UAL buy-out group is now willing to pay higher bank fees and interest
Nor is the group likely to come forward with a revised offer within the next 48 hours despite the hopes of many traders.The group's advisers want to make certain they have firm bank commitments the second time around
especially since there aren't any competing bids.Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis hasn't shown signs of pursuing a $300-a-share back-up bid he made last month
In addition, the coalition of labor and management, longtime enemies who joined forces only under the threat of Mr. Davis's bid, could break apart now.The group's resilience gets its first test today when 30 top pilot union leaders convene outside Chicago in a previously scheduled meeting
The group's resilience gets its first test today when 30 top pilot union leaders convene outside Chicago in a previously scheduled meeting.Union Chairman F.C. (Rick) Dubinsky faces the tough task of explaining why banks refused to finance a buy-out the members approved overwhelmingly last week
they are crucial to any sale or restructuring because they can refuse to fly the airplanes.If they were to insist on a low bid of, say $200 a share, the board mightn't be able to obtain a higher offer from other bidders because banks might hesitate to finance a transaction the pilots oppose
Also, because UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and other UAL executives have joined the pilots' bid, the board might be forced to exclude him from its deliberations in order to be fair to other bidders.That could cost him the chance to influence the outcome and perhaps join the winning bidder
