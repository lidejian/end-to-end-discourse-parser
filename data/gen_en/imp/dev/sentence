The bill would prevent the Resolution Trust Corp. from raising temporary working capital by having an RTC-owned bank or thrift issue debt that wouldn't be counted on the federal budget.to restrict the RTC to Treasury borrowings only, unless the agency receives specific congressional authorization
The complex financing plan in the S&L bailout law includes raising $30 billion from debt issued by the newly created RTC.This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit
This financing system was created in the new law in order to keep the bailout spending from swelling the budget deficit.Another $20 billion would be raised through Treasury bonds, which pay lower interest rates
But the RTC also requires "working" capital to maintain the bad assets of thrifts that are sold.That debt would be paid off as the assets are sold
It's a problem that clearly has to be resolved.The agency has already spent roughly $19 billion selling 34 insolvent S&Ls, and it is likely to sell or merge 600 by the time the bailout concludes
Absent other working capital the RTC would be forced to delay other thrift resolutions until cash could be raised by selling the bad assets. "We would have to wait until we have collected on those assets before we can move forward
The complicated language in the huge new law has muddied the fight.The law does allow the RTC to borrow from the Treasury up to $5 billion at any time
That secrecy leads to a proposal like the one from Ways and Means, which seems to me sort of draconian.The RTC is going to have to pay a price of prior consultation on the Hill if they want that kind of flexibility
Hard on the heels of Friday's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that's followed, a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message: Keep on investing, the market's just fine.Their mission is to keep clients from fleeing the market, as individual investors did in droves after the crash in October
Just days after the 1987 crash, major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors.This time around, they're moving even faster
PaineWebber Inc. filmed a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night.Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday, and wrote another new ad appearing today

It considered running them during tomorrow night's World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday.Other brokerage firms, including Merrill Lynch & Co., were plotting out potential new ad strategies
The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around.This time, the firms were ready
Fidelity, for example, prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge.When the market went into its free fall Friday afternoon, the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday editions of half a dozen newspapers
When the market went into its free fall Friday afternoon, the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday editions of half a dozen newspapers.The ads touted Fidelity's automated 800-number beneath the huge headline, "Fidelity Is Ready For Your Call
A Fidelity spokesman says the 800-line, which already was operating but which many clients didn't know about, received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend. "A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us," he says

Today's Fidelity ad goes a step further, encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity.Underneath the headline "Diversification," it counsels, "Based on the events of the past week, all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market's volatility." It goes on to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name

PaineWebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash.In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle, the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house, ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night
The new PaineWebber commercial features Mary Farrell, one of the firm's most visible investment strategists, sounding particularly bullish.Taped just as the market closed yesterday, it offers Ms. Farrell advising, "We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle. . . . We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation

With the market fluctuating and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday, investment firms had to constantly revise their approach.At Shearson Lehman, executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend, then had to regroup yesterday afternoon
At Shearson Lehman, executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend, then had to regroup yesterday afternoon.The plan had been to make one of Shearson's easy-to-film, black-and-white "Where We Stand" commercials, which have been running occasionally in response to news events since 1985
The plan had been to make one of Shearson's easy-to-film, black-and-white "Where We Stand" commercials, which have been running occasionally in response to news events since 1985.The ad would have run during the World Series tomorrow, replacing the debut commercial of Shearson's new ad campaign, "Leadership by Example

and the mean ol' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend.The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago Cubs in the National League playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home-team Oakland A's
In game two, on a cool Sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn, a lot of the catching up was done by the A's catcher, Terry Steinbach.He hit a 2-0 pitch from Rick Reuschel into the left-field stands in inning four to stretch his team's lead from 2-1 to a decisive 5-1, where it stayed
He hit a 2-0 pitch from Rick Reuschel into the left-field stands in inning four to stretch his team's lead from 2-1 to a decisive 5-1, where it stayed.So what if Steinbach had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular-season games, and batted in the seventh position of the A's lineup

On Saturday night, quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and, no doubt, future droughts.Mark McGwire, the big, red-haired Oakland first baseman, had three hits in four at bats, two more than he'd had in the five-game Dodger series in which he'd gone 1-for-17
Mark McGwire, the big, red-haired Oakland first baseman, had three hits in four at bats, two more than he'd had in the five-game Dodger series in which he'd gone 1-for-17.The A-men batting Nos. 6 through 9, a.k.a. the "bottom of the order," got seven of their team's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5-0 decision
Right-hander Dave Stewart held the Giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the Saturday ledger.That he was the A's winningest pitcher during its American League campaign with a 21-9 mark, plus two wins over Toronto in the playoffs, indicates he may have some evening up coming, but with the way his split-fingered fastball is behaving, that might not be this week
That he was the A's winningest pitcher during its American League campaign with a 21-9 mark, plus two wins over Toronto in the playoffs, indicates he may have some evening up coming, but with the way his split-fingered fastball is behaving, that might not be this week.The same goes for Mike Moore, another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the Giants but a run and four hits in seven innings in Sunday's contest
Every guy they put out there had a better split-finger than the guy before," marveled Giant manager Roger Craig.He's an ex-hurler who's one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery, which looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat
The upshot of the downshoot is that the A's go into San Francisco's Candlestick Park tonight up two games to none in the best-of-seven fest.The stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs (29 of 39) that took 2-0 Series leads went on to win it all
The stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs (29 of 39) that took 2-0 Series leads went on to win it all.That's not an average to soothe Giant rooters
but they observe them in relative calm.Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000-plus seats of Oakland Coliseum, and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition, hostilities advanced no further, at least as far as I could see
A few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams. "I'm for the Giants today, but only because they lost yesterday.I love 'em both.The only thing I'm rooting for is for the Series to go seven games," said David Williams, a Sacramento septuagenarian, at the Coliseum before Sunday's go
I'm for the Giants today, but only because they lost yesterday.I love 'em both
I love 'em both.The only thing I'm rooting for is for the Series to go seven games
The above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility.I choose to believe it's the latter, although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here, including the A's and Giants, is originally from somewhere else
although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here, including the A's and Giants, is originally from somewhere else.Suffice it to say that if this were a New York Yankees-Mets series, or one between the Chicago Cubs and White Sox (hey, it's possible), you'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans
Anyway, the A's gave you a lot of heroes to root for.In the opening game, besides Steinbach and Stewart, there was Walt Weiss, a twiggy-looking, second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery

An A's co-hero of the second game was Rickey Henderson, who exemplifies the hot side of the hot-cold equation.He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits, seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats, and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday, along with walking, stealing a base and scoring a run

The company, however, said orders in the U.S. showed "good gains" during the latest quarter.Analysts estimate those gains at 12% to 13%, a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of NCR's major customers
These factors, combined with a strong dollar, should negatively affect the current quarter's results, NCR said.In the year-earlier fourth quarter, NCR had profit of $149.6 million, or $1.85 a share, on revenue of $1.8 billion
Mr. Hingorani said he lowered his full-year estimates for 1989 to $5.35 a share from $5.50 a share.Revenue projections were slashed to $6.03 billion from $6.20 billion

For many of London's securities traders, it was a day that started nervously in the small hours.By lunchtime, the selling was at near-panic fever
So it went yesterday in the trading rooms of London's financial district.In the wake of Wall Street's plunge last Friday, the London market was considered especially vulnerable

The collapsed plan to acquire UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, spurred quick action on the legislation, introduced Wednesday and approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote yesterday.The bill is expected to be taken up by the Public Works and Transportation Committee tomorrow, and a floor vote by next week will be urged
The measure drew criticism from the Bush administration and a parting shot from financier Donald Trump.In a letter to subcommittee Chairman James Oberstar (D., Minn.), Mr. Trump criticized the bill as an explicit effort to thwart his bid for AMR, and said it contributed to the collapse of the deal
the withdrawal of the Trump bid for AMR isn't likely to deflate efforts to push the legislation. "It's still on the fast track and we still want to do it
Currently, the transportation secretary doesn't have clearly established authority to block mergers, but can take the drastic step of revoking the operating certificate of any carrier the official considers unfit.Supporters of the legislation view the bill as an effort to add stability and certainty to the airline-acquisition process, and to preserve the safety and fitness of the industry
The bill would allow the secretary to reject a buy-out if sufficient information hasn't been provided, or if the buy-out is likely to weaken the carrier financially, result in a substantial reduction in size of the airline through disposal of assets, or give control to a foreign interest.If more information is needed, the secretary would have authority to extend the review period 20 days

The latest quarter's loss equals $9.92 a share.In the year-earlier quarter, Morgan earned $233.6 million, or $1.25 a share
George M. Salem, analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., called the results "mildly disappointing." Excluding the $2 billion provision and allowing for the taxes Morgan paid, earnings were about 65 cents a share, Mr. Salem said
Net interest income sank 27% in the quarter to $254 million from $347 million.The interest rate on short-term funds was "sharply higher
Morgan received $2 million of interest payments on its medium and long-term Brazilian loans; had they been accruing interest, net interest income would have been $35 million higher in the quarter

The Charlotte, N.C., company said earnings rose to $143.6 million, or $1.45 a share, from $58.9 million, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier.The latest quarter included a gain of $56.1 million, or 59 cents a share, related to the purchase of the remaining 51% of NCNB Texas National Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp
The strong performance, however, contrasted with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of NCNB's problem loans, particularly in the Southeast.In the third quarter, nonperforming assets jumped to $474.1 million, or 1.43% of net loans and leases, from $232.8 million, or 1.13% in the second quarter

Net rose to $185.1 million, or $1.55 a share, from $167.9 million, or $1.47 a share, a year earlier.the gain resulted mainly from a $54 million increase in net interest income
The company said the gain resulted mainly from a $54 million increase in net interest income, reflecting a 33% increase in real estate loans (mainly residential), and a 19% rise in consumer loans.These high-yielding loans in effect replaced some low-yielding assets such as inter-bank loans, which were allowed to decrease
The loan growth offset continuing real-estate loan losses in the depressed Arizona market.Security Pacific reported a 33% increase in net credit losses for the quarter, to $109 million from $81.9 million in the year-ago period
Security Pacific's loan-loss provision was down 22%, or $30.4 million, because it added to its foreign-debt reserve the year before.Non-interest income fell 6% in the quarter, mainly because of an unusual gain a year earlier from the sale of Hong Kong banking operations

holders may be misled by the provision in the McCaw proposal that "guarantees" private market value after five years for the remaining shares.McCaw has "no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain

Each warrant allows the holder to buy one BSN share for $10.75 a share at any time over the next seven years.BSN currently has 4.6 million common shares outstanding
The company said it can redeem the warrants at its option for $1 each.The offer isn't contingent on a certain amount of debt or stock being exchanged
it is making the offer to shrink its capital and increase shareholder value.If all the bondholders and holders of one million common shares accept the offer, BSN will increase its debt by $9 million, but it also will recognize a $2 million gain from retiring the old debt
If all the bondholders and holders of one million common shares accept the offer, BSN will increase its debt by $9 million.We have sufficient cash flow to handle that

What happened Friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently coordinated to handle another meltdown in prices.No fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling
After the 1987 plunge, markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose.The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers: If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day, the exchange will halt trading for one hour; if the decline hits 400 points, the exchange will close for an additional two hours

If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day, the exchange will halt trading for one hour; if the decline hits 400 points, the exchange will close for an additional two hours
The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers: If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day, the exchange will halt trading for one hour; if the decline hits 400 points, the exchange will close for an additional two hours.The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies, calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels
It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic.A temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself.But there is also the possibility that shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices
What happened Friday was the worst of all worlds.The futures exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes, after the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points, or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index.Options markets stopped trading in many securities.The New York Stock Exchange, under its own rules, remained open. With nowhere else to go, sellers, and particularly program traders, focused all their selling on the New York Stock Exchange.As liquidity on that market weakened, prices fell sharply

Options markets stopped trading in many securities.The New York Stock Exchange, under its own rules, remained open
With nowhere else to go, sellers, and particularly program traders, focused all their selling on the New York Stock Exchange.As liquidity on that market weakened, prices fell sharply
Had the futures and options markets been open, additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline, most probably, would have been less intense.At 3:30, after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and Washington, the futures exchanges reopened
Futures trading, however, was halted altogether at 3:45, after the futures markets had dropped an additional 30 points, which is the daily limit for price declines.At this point, the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the New York Stock Exchange
It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange, the futures markets and the options markets, though physically separate, have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively.Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them
It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers.To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility, either all markets should be open to trading or none
Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday, but they probably would have made for smoother, less volatile executions.It's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open
It's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open.Let's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a 250-point decline
The need for hurried last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets.The new circuit breakers, if they are to be applied at all, will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open

Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved intolerably expensive in the past, and inevitably are twisted to the benefit of well-connected developers and lobbyists, as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal, or congressmen.Indirect subsidies, through the FHA, for instance, are little better

In its nicely produced publication "Where Will Our Children Live?" the NAHB does acknowledge that "of course, the full measure of housing affordability cannot be provided by the federal government."

The ceremonies began Friday afternoon when word spread that the UAL buy-out was collapsing.Although the union-bidder expects to patch together a substitute offer, consisting of less cash, the failure to get cash from Japanese and American banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the pageant of high-leverage takeover deals is ending
Lots of other entries made up the parade, of course -- notably a surprisingly large increase in producer prices, signalling Federal Reserve tightness; and the Bush administration's (temporary?) defeat in trying to lower the capital-gains tax.As usual, few favorable reviews were heard for that ever-present marching band of program traders, although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write
What really spooked the crowds along Wall Street, however, was the sudden concern that, whatever the reason, the pool of debt capital is drying up.Gray Friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers, rather than the small investor, as their highly margined investments in the "deal" stocks are jeopardized by the unexpected drying up of the lubricant for deal financing

These are all market excesses (putting aside the artificial boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity), and what we've seen is the market reining them in.Of course, Washington hadn't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle, and its tendency to meddle in the leverage equation remains a troublesome prospect, but those preliminary steps shouldn't distract us from the basic market fundamentalism that was at work on Friday
If it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused Gray Friday, what are the implications for policy makers?After all, the stock market's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken to confirm the anti-debt direction of regulators
After all, the stock market's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken to confirm the anti-debt direction of regulators.Is this a case where private markets are approving of Washington's bashing of Wall Street
that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior.The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings
The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged restructurings.The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the scarcity of bank capital for recent deals underscores the wisdom of letting the free markets operate
If takeover premiums become excessive, if LBO dealmakers become too aggressive, then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers, and the markets will move with lightning speed to impose appropriate sanctions.Yes, the broader exchanges got caught up in the spiral, but they rode the tiger up all year
but they rode the tiger up all year.Not surprisingly, he sometimes bites
while the besieged managers of prospective targets cheered lustily.If you identify with the besieged managers, you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington
If you identify with the besieged managers, you must concede that speedy and effective relief from the excesses of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington.If you side with the arbitragers and raiders, you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators
The truth is, Washington understands politics better than economics.Although the average citizen is probably not harmed too much from Washington's rhetorical war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial leveraging, actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm
actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm.Any such attempt to distinguish "good debt" from "bad debt," or to draw the line at a particular industry is likely to blunt the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general

Nobuto Yasuda, a director at Yamaichi Investment Trust & Management Co., called yesterday's session "a good scenario" for Japan. "Now we are looking for the time to place buy orders," he said
Now we are looking for the time to place buy orders.For us institutional investors, the chance for buying has come
Isao Ushikubo, general manager of the investment research department at Toyo Trust & Banking Co., also was optimistic.He described Friday's plunge in the U.S. as a "fleeting" event resulting in part from excessive merger and acquisition activity
this is the best time to buy.Those shares which had posted gains on M&A speculation were dashed with cold water, but as far as major stocks are concerned, there isn't much impact
Other fund managers were similarly sanguine. "We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities," said Masato Murakami, chief portfolio manager in the pension fund management department at Yasuda Trust & Banking Co
We have no plans to adjust our asset allocation in foreign equities.Friday's Wall Street decline was "well within the range of volatility" that Yasuda Trust plans for when it charts its overseas investment strategy

Major indexes declined more than 8% in Australia and New Zealand and 6.5% in Hong Kong.Bangkok, Manila, Seoul, Taipei and Jakarta escaped with slightly smaller losses
It's pure psychology.Markets in this region aren't so geared to leveraged buy-outs, and their economies generally are in good shape, but there's no doubt that Asia is still following America's lead
Several analysts said Malaysia and Singapore had the biggest losses because they are relatively open to rapid cash flows.Hong Kong is the region's next most open market, but many foreign investors have been staying away from it since it plunged in June amid political turmoil in China
Singapore took the hit because when people want to get out, they tend to go where the liquidity is.that even after Monday's 10% decline, the Straits Times index is up 24% this year, so investors who bailed out generally did so profitably
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 180.60 to finish at 2601.70.Trading was heavy at about one billion shares, compared with 473.9 million Friday

Frank Lloyd Wright is reported to have said once that if you tipped the world on its side, everything loose would end up in California.We've always thought that Mr. Wright underestimated California's vitality, but maybe the state's la-la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place
but maybe the state's la-la factions are starting to overwhelm the forces that made it such a significant place.What else is one to make of the whacky save-the-earth initiative just proposed by several major environmental groups and organized by the state's attorney general
If passed by the voters, the recently announced initiative would phase out major pesticides, reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 40%, ban new offshore drilling, ban chemicals thought to deplete the ozone layer, and create a new state environmental officer armed with a $40 million budget to sue any firm or agency he thinks is being too dirty.The initiative is based largely on the wish-lists of the green lobby: the Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the National Toxics Campaign and the Citizens for a Better Environment
The initiative is based largely on the wish-lists of the green lobby: the Sierra Club, the League of Conservation Voters, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the National Toxics Campaign and the Citizens for a Better Environment.Interestingly, the Environmental Defense Fund is having nothing to do with this one
Not only Californians but all Americans would pay if this thing passed.The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that don't meet the initiative's standards
The initiative bars the sale of any crops in California that don't meet the initiative's standards.Kansas wheat farmers and Florida fruit growers would have to adjust or give up the California market
As usual the green lobby's proposal is disconnected from scientific reality.Consider the greenhouse-effect provision
Consider the greenhouse-effect provision.The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40%
The proposed initiative would mandate a reduction of carbon dioxide of 40%.Even if one buys into the whole greenhouse theory, it is inconceivable that reductions in a single state could have any impact on what is billed as a global problem
The first place to look under these circumstances is at the ways in which the sponsors themselves will benefit.The key here is the ambition of state Attorney General John Van de Kamp
The key here is the ambition of state Attorney General John Van de Kamp.He's running for governor
and cobbled them into a single unwieldy initiative to be placed on the ballot for election on Nov. 6, 1990.That's also the day of the gubernatorial election
And it allows Mr. Van de Kamp to get around campaign spending limits.He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign
He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign; all the spending for the Van de Kamp initiative is gravy
He can spend the legal maximum for his campaign; all the spending for the Van de Kamp initiative (on which there are no limits) is gravy.This initiative is being labeled The Big Green, but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback
This initiative is being labeled The Big Green, but maybe it should be called The Big Greenback. (The Republican candidate, Sen. Pete Wilson, is playing the initiative fundraising game too, sponsoring his own crime initiative
it is of course conceivable that in modern California it could slide through.This is the state that recently passed the Prop. 65 anti-toxic initiative
This is the state that recently passed the Prop. 65 anti-toxic initiative.If this new proposal ever does become law, the green lobby will benefit directly
The initiative creates a free floating state environmental officer to sue companies or government agencies that do things he doesn't like.That means the NRDC and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation
That means the NRDC and such groups no longer would have to spend as much money on litigation; taxpayers would bear the cost
Mr. Van de Kamp and his allies may be hoping that the environment is such a mom and apple-pie issue among certain segments of California's population now that almost any collection of anti-scientific, anti-pocketbook nonsense can pass under its rubric.Of course the state's liberals are not yet a nation unto themselves
Spurred by waves of large-scale buying in blue-chip stocks, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied yesterday and erased about a half of Friday's 190.58-point plunge, gaining 88.12 to 2657.38.It was the fourth-biggest advance for the average of 30 blue chips, on frenetic New York Stock Exchange volume of 416,290,000 shares -- the highest since the days after the 1987 crash

But most of the 30 blue-chip stocks in the average, including Eastman Kodak and General Motors, couldn't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from Friday's late-afternoon rout.At 9:45, Procter & Gamble -- one of the most important Dow bellwethers of late -- opened down 2 3/4 to 117

The restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic, and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less.The exemption allowed on longer flights to Alaska and Hawaii appears to be largely a face-saving concession for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry, which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years
But the six-hour compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions.As a practical matter, flights from the West Coast to Hawaii would be covered as they are under the time limit, but the language would exempt longer routes beginning, for example, in Chicago or on the East Coast
Within the Senate, the ban has had aggressive support from Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D., N.J.), who has used his position as a Senate Appropriations subcommittee chairman to garner votes for the initiative.The measure is attached to the more than $26 billion fiscal 1990 transportation bill within Mr. Lautenberg's jurisdiction, and the final compromise is laced with more than $205 million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports, including Denver

Within the Federal Aviation Administration, the final bill promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than 20% from last year.The facilities account includes $40 million for Denver's ambitious new airport
Texas Air Corp., which owns Continental, and the Air Transport Association were prominent in the lobbying.The industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until Denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for 50% of the gates
Though smaller in total dollars, the conference agreed to preserve an estimated $30.6 million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports.The sum is more than double what the House had approved for the program, but the list of qualified airports would be cut by 22 under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy
Congress previously cut six airports this year.The impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than $200 for each passenger in subsidies

The latest reading of 223.0 was up from 222.3 in July and 215.3 as recently as March.The August rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator, which uses the 1967 average as a base of 100

the Columbia analysts foresee uninterrupted economic growth through the rest of this year and next year as well.They expect a 2.6% rise in 1990 in the gross national product, after adjustment for inflation

The Columbia economists also have reconstructed how the long leading index would have behaved, had it existed, in 1929, before the stock market crash in October that ushered in the Great Depression.The indicator reached a peak in January 1929 and then fell steadily up to and through the crash
The indicator reached a peak in January 1929 and then fell steadily up to and through the crash. "It was an entirely different pattern from what we're seeing now
