Some "circuit breakers" installed after the October 1987 crash failed their first test, traders say, unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures.The 49 stock specialist firms on the Big Board floor once again couldn't handle the selling pressure
Some "circuit breakers" installed after the October 1987 crash failed their first test unable to cool the selling panic in both stocks and futures.The 49 stock specialist firms on the Big Board floor -- the buyers and sellers of last resort who were criticized after the 1987 crash -- once again couldn't handle the selling pressure. Big investment banks refused to step up to the plate to support the beleaguered floor traders by buying big blocks of stock.Heavy selling of Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures in Chicago relentlessly beat stocks downward
The finger-pointing has already begun. "The equity market was illiquid.Once again {the specialists} were not able to handle the imbalances on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange," said Christopher Pedersen, senior vice president at Twenty-First Securities Corp

It is easy to say the specialist isn't doing his job.When the dollar is in a free-fall, even central banks can't stop it

Then in a lightning plunge, the Dow Jones industrials in barely an hour surrendered about a third of their gains this year, chalking up a 190.58-point, or 6.9%, loss on the day in gargantuan trading volume.Final-hour trading accelerated to 108.1 million shares, a record for the Big Board

At the end of the day, 251.2 million shares were traded.The Dow Jones industrials closed at 2569.26
In percentage terms, however, the Dow's dive was the 12th-worst ever and the sharpest since the market fell 156.83, or 8%, a week after Black Monday.The Dow fell 22.6% on Black Monday
Shares of UAL, the parent of United Airlines, were extremely active all day Friday, reacting to news and rumors about the proposed $6.79 billion buy-out of the airline by an employee-management group.Wall Street's takeover-stock speculators, or "risk arbitragers," had placed unusually large bets that a takeover would succeed and UAL stock would rise
At 2:43 p.m. EDT, came the sickening news: The Big Board was halting trading in UAL, "pending news." On the exchange floor, "as soon as UAL stopped trading, we braced for a panic
On the exchange floor, "as soon as UAL stopped trading, we braced for a panic.Several traders could be seen shaking their heads when the news flashed
The market crumbled.Arbitragers couldn't dump their UAL stock -- but they rid themselves of nearly every "rumor" stock they had
But as panic spread, speculators began to sell blue-chip stocks such as Philip Morris and International Business Machines to offset their losses.When trading was halted in Philip Morris, the stock was trading at 41, down 3 3/8, while IBM closed 5 5/8 lower at 102
Selling snowballed because of waves of automatic "stop-loss" orders, which are triggered by computer when prices fall to certain levels.Most of the stock selling pressure came from Wall Street professionals, including computer-guided program traders
Now, at 3:07, one of the market's post-crash "reforms" took hold as the S&P 500 futures contract had plunged 12 points, equivalent to around a 100-point drop in the Dow industrials.Under an agreement signed by the Big Board and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, trading was temporarily halted in Chicago
As a result, the link between the futures and stock markets ripped apart.Without the guidepost of stock-index futures -- the barometer of where traders think the overall stock market is headed -- many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the Big Board
Without the guidepost of stock-index futures many traders were afraid to trust stock prices quoted on the Big Board.The futures halt was even assailed by Big Board floor traders
The futures halt was even assailed by Big Board floor traders. "It screwed things up," said one major specialist
This confusion effectively halted one form of program trading, stock index arbitrage, that closely links the futures and stock markets, and has been blamed by some for the market's big swings. (In a stock-index arbitrage sell program, traders buy or sell big baskets of stocks and offset the trade in futures to lock in a price difference
When the airline information came through, it cracked every model we had for the marketplace.We didn't even get a chance to do the programs we wanted to do
But stocks kept falling.The Dow industrials were down 55 points at 3 p.m. before the futures-trading halt
The Dow industrials were down 55 points at 3 p.m. before the futures-trading halt.At 3:30 p.m., at the end of the "cooling off" period, the average was down 114.76 points
the circuit breaker "worked well mechanically.it's nonproductive at this point to get into a debate if index arbitrage would have helped or hurt things
Under another post-crash system, Big Board President Richard Grasso (Mr.Phelan was flying to Bangkok as the market was falling) was talking on an "inter-exchange hot line" to the other exchanges, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Board.He camped out at a high-tech nerve center on the floor of the Big Board, where he could watch updates on prices and pending stock orders
At about 3:30 p.m. EDT, S&P futures resumed trading, and for a brief time the futures and stock markets started to come back in line.Buyers stepped in to the futures pit
At about 3:45, the S&P market careened to still another limit, of 30 points down, and trading was locked again.the S&P was signaling that the Dow could fall as much as 200 points
During this time, small investors began ringing their brokers, wondering whether another crash had begun.At Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., which is trying to cater to small investors, some demoralized brokers thought this would be the final confidence-crusher
I have a hunch that this particular decline today is something `more ado about less. ' It would be my inclination to advise clients not to sell, to look for an opportunity to buy
At Merrill Lynch & Co., the nation's biggest brokerage firm, a news release was prepared headlined "Merrill Lynch Comments on Market Drop." The release cautioned that "there are significant differences between the current environment and that of October 1987" and that there are still "attractive investment opportunities" in the stock market
And I think a lot of people will harp on program trading.It's going to bring the debate right back to the forefront
As the Dow average ground to its final 190.58 loss Friday, the S&P pit stayed locked at its 30-point trading limit.2,000 S&P contracts were for sale on the close, the equivalent of $330 million in stock
it left the market vulnerable to continued selling this morning.Stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself
Stock-index futures contracts settled at much lower prices than indexes of the stock market itself.At those levels, stocks are set up to be hammered by index arbitragers, who lock in profits by buying futures when futures prices fall, and simultaneously sell off stocks
The de-linkage between the stock and futures markets Friday will undoubtedly cause renewed debate about whether Wall Street is properly prepared for another crash situation.The Big Board's Mr. Grasso said, "Our systemic performance was good
But the exchange will "look at the performance of all specialists in all stocks.Obviously we'll take a close look at any situation in which we think the dealer-community obligations weren't met
But specialists complain privately that just as in the 1987 crash, the "upstairs" firms -- big investment banks that support the market by trading big blocks of stock -- stayed on the sidelines during Friday's blood-letting.Mr. Phelan said, "It will take another day or two" to analyze who was buying and selling Friday

Some shareholders have held off until today because any fund exchanges made after Friday's close would take place at today's closing prices.Stock fund redemptions during the 1987 debacle didn't begin to snowball until after the market opened on Black Monday
they're ready.Many have raised cash levels, which act as a buffer against steep market declines
Mario Gabelli, for instance, holds cash positions well above 20% in several of his funds.Windsor Fund's John Neff and Mutual Series' Michael Price said they had raised their cash levels to more than 20% and 30%, respectively, this year
Even Peter Lynch, manager of Fidelity's $12.7 billion Magellan Fund, the nation's largest stock fund, built up cash to 7% or $850 million.One reason is that after two years of monthly net redemptions, the fund posted net inflows of money from investors in August and September
Not all funds have raised cash levels, of course.As a group, stock funds held 10.2% of assets in cash as of August, the latest figures available from the Investment Company Institute
As a group, stock funds held 10.2% of assets in cash as of August, the latest figures available from the Investment Company Institute.That was modestly higher than the 8.8% and 9.2% levels in August and September of 1987
But a strong level of investor withdrawals is much more unlikely this time around.A major reason is that investors already have sharply scaled back their purchases of stock funds since Black Monday

Mr. Otradovec said Boeing told America West that the 757 it was supposed to get this Thursday wouldn't be delivered until Nov. 7 -- the day after the airline had been planning to initiate service at Houston with four daily flights, including three nonstops to Phoenix and one nonstop to Las Vegas.Now, those routes aren't expected to begin until Jan

America West, though, is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be. "I figure that American and United probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets, they might not miss one at all
Indeed, a random check Friday didn't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations.Southwest Airlines has a Boeing 737-300 set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time

Meanwhile, supervisors and non-striking employees have been trying to finish some 40 aircraft -- mostly 747 and 767 jumbo jets at the company's Everett, Wash., plant -- that were all but completed before the walkout.As of Friday, four had been delivered and a fifth plane, a 747-400, was supposed to be flown out over the weekend to Air China
No date has yet been set to get back to the bargaining table. "We want to make sure they know what they want before they come back

The timing of Quantum's chief executive officer, John Hoyt Stookey, appeared to be nothing less than inspired, because he had just increased Quantum's reliance on plastics.The company outpaced much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew fivefold in two years
The company outpaced much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew fivefold in two years.Mr. Stookey said of the boom, "It's going to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks
But now prices have nose-dived and Quantum's profit is plummeting.Some securities analysts are looking for no better than break-even results from the company for the third quarter
Some securities analysts are looking for no better than break-even results from the company for the third quarter, compared with year-earlier profit of $99.8 million, or $3.92 a share, on sales of $724.4 million.The stock, having lost nearly a quarter of its value since Sept. 1, closed at $34.375 share, down $1.125, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday
To a degree, Quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so-called commodity plastics that pervade modern life.Having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history, these producers now see their prices eroding
And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the heady period that is just behind them. "We were all wonderful heroes last year Now we're at the bottom of the heap
We were all wonderful heroes last year.Now we're at the bottom of the heap
At Quantum the trouble is magnified by the company's heavy dependence on plastics.the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics after Mr. Stookey took the chief executive's job in 1986
Once known as National Distillers & Chemical Corp., the company exited the wine and spirits business and plowed more of its resources into plastics after Mr. Stookey took the chief executive's job in 1986.Mr. Stookey, 59 years old, declined to be interviewed for this article, but he has consistently argued that over the long haul -- across both the peaks and the troughs of the plastics market -- Quantum will prosper through its new direction
Quantum's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene resin, used to make garbage bags, milk jugs, housewares, toys and meat packaging, among other items.In the U.S. polyethylene market, Quantum has claimed the largest share, about 20%
When the price of polyethylene moves a mere penny a pound, Quantum's annual profit fluctuates by about 85 cents a share, provided no other variables are changing.In recent months the price of polyethylene, even more than that of other commodity plastics, has taken a dive
In recent months the price of polyethylene, even more than that of other commodity plastics, has taken a dive.Benchmark grades, which still sold for as much as 50 cents a pound last spring, have skidded to between 35 cents and 40 cents
Meanwhile, the price of ethylene, the chemical building block of polyethylene, hasn't dropped nearly so fast.That discrepancy hurts Quantum badly, because its own plants cover only about half of its ethylene needs
By many accounts, an early hint of a price rout in the making came at the start of this year.China, which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene, abruptly halted them
to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices spiraled up. "People were even hoarding bags
Now producers hope prices have hit bottom.They recently announced increases of a few cents a pound to take effect in the next several weeks
One doubter is George Krug, a chemical-industry analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. and a bear on plastics stocks.Noting others' estimates of when price increases can be sustained, he remarks, "Some say October.Some say November.I say 1992
Some say October.Some say November
Some say November.I say 1992
I say 1992.that efforts to firm up prices will be undermined by producers' plans to expand production capacity
A quick turnaround is crucial to Quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy.The company is trying to carry out a three-year, $1.3 billion plant-expansion program started this year
Quantum described the payout at the time as a way for it to share the bonanza with its holders, because its stock price wasn't reflecting the huge profit increases.Some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to dispel takeover speculation
But others came away thinking he had given something less than his usual straight-from-the-shoulder performance.In any case, on the day of the meeting, Quantum's shares slid $2.625 to $36.625 in Big Board trading
On top of everything else, Quantum confronts a disaster at its plant in Morris, Ill.After an explosion idled the plant in June, the company progressed in September to within 12 hours of completing the drawn-out process of restarting it.Then a second explosion occurred.Two workers died and six remain in the hospital
Then a second explosion occurred.Two workers died and six remain in the hospital
This human toll adds the most painful dimension yet to the sudden change in Quantum's fortunes.Until this year, the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up trade-group safety awards
A prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another imponderable into Quantum's financial future.When a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand, calculating lost profit and thus claims under business-interruption insurance is straightforward.But the numbers become trickier -- and subject to dickering between insured and insurer -- when demand is shifting
Quantum hopes the Morris plant, where limited production got under way last week, will resume full operation by year's end.The plant usually accounts for 20% to 25% of Quantum's polyethylene production and 50% of its ethylene production
Not everything looks grim for Quantum.The plant expansion should strengthen the company's sway in the polyethylene business, where market share is often taken through sheer capacity
The plant expansion should strengthen the company's sway in the polyethylene business, where market share is often taken through sheer capacity.By lifting ethylene production, the expansion will also lower the company's raw material costs

Brazil is expected to negotiate a somewhat bigger share of the U.S. market than it had under the previous five-year steel quotas, which expired Sept. 30.Brazil and Venezuela are the only two countries that haven't completed steel talks with the U.S. for the year ending Oct. 1, 1990
In recent years, U.S. steelmakers have supplied about 80% of the 100 million tons of steel used annually by the nation.Of the remaining 20% needed, the steel-quota negotiations allocate about 15% to foreign suppliers
which isn't included in the quota program.Other countries that don't have formal steel quotas with the U.S., such as Taiwan, Sweden and Argentina, also have supplied steel
Other countries that don't have formal steel quotas with the U.S., such as Taiwan, Sweden and Argentina, also have supplied steel.Some of these countries have in recent years made informal agreements with the U.S. that are similar to quotas
It also said it would use that two-and-a-half year period to work toward an international consensus on freeing up the international steel trade, which has been notoriously managed, subsidized and protected by governments.The U.S. termed its plan, a "trade liberalization program," despite the fact that it is merely an extension
Mexico, which was one of the first countries to conclude its steel talks with the U.S., virtually doubled its quota to 0.95% of the U.S. steel market from 0.48% under the previous quotas.South Korea is set to get a small increase to about 1.95%
South Korea is set to get a small increase to about 1.95%.That increase rises to slightly more than 2% of the U.S. market if a joint Korean-U.S. steel project is included
The EC and Japan -- the U.S.'s largest steel suppliers -- haven't been filling their quotas to the full extent.The EC steel industry has been supplying about 5% of the U.S. market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7%
The EC steel industry has been supplying about 5% of the U.S. market compared with recent quotas of about 6.7%.Japan has been shipping steel to total about 4.5% of the U.S. market compared with a quota of 5.9%
Japan, the EC, Brazil, Mexico and South Korea provide about 80% of the steel imported to the U.S. under the quota program.The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters, such as Australia and Venezuela
The U.S. had about an extra 2% of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks.That was essentially made up of a 1% increase in the overall quota program and 1% from cutting Japan's allowance

Elcotel, a telecommunications company, had net income of $272,000, or five cents a share, in its year-earlier second quarter, ended Sept. 30.Revenue totaled $5 million.that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $4 million
The lower results reflect a 12-month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay telephones, Elcotel's primary business.Elcotel will also benefit from moving into other areas
Foremost among those is the company's entrance into the public facsimile business.Within the next year, Elcotel expects to place 10,000 fax machines in hotels, municipal buildings, drugstores and other public settings around the country
Within the next year, Elcotel expects to place 10,000 fax machines, made by Minolta in Japan, in hotels, municipal buildings, drugstores and other public settings around the country.Elcotel will provide a credit-card reader for the machines to collect, store and forward billing data
Elcotel has also developed an automatic call processor that will make further use of the company's system for automating and handling credit-card calls and collect calls.Automatic call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone not just phones produced by Elcotel
The Cincinnati consumer-products giant got clobbered two years ago in Japan when Kao introduced a powerful detergent, called Attack, which quickly won a 30% stake in the Japanese markets. "They don't want to get caught again
Retailers in Phoenix, Ariz., say P&G's new powdered detergent -- to be called Cheer with Color Guard -- will be on shelves in that market by early November.A P&G spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to Phoenix started late last month

Superconcentrates aren't entirely new for P&G.The company introduced a superconcentrated Lemon Cheer in Japan after watching the success of Attack
after watching the success of Attack.When Attack hit the shelves in 1987, P&G's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8% from more than 20%
When Attack hit the shelves in 1987, P&G's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8% from more than 20%.With the help of Lemon Cheer, P&G's share is now estimated to be 12%
While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products, the true test for P&G will be in the $4 billion U.S. detergent market, where growth is slow and liquids have gained prominence over powders.The company may have chosen to market the product under the Cheer name since it's already expanded its best-selling Tide into 16 different varieties, including this year's big hit, Tide with Bleach
With superconcentrates, however, it isn't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more; many people tend to dump too much detergent into the washing machine
it will take up less shelf space. "When shelf space was cheap, bigger was better
But with so many brands vying for space, that's no longer the case.If the new Cheer sells well, the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own superconcentrates
Competition is bound to get tougher if Kao introduces a product like Attack in the U.S.To be sure, Kao wouldn't have an easy time taking U.S. market share away from the mighty P&G, which has about 23% of the market
Some believe P&G's interest in a superconcentrated detergent goes beyond the concern for the Japanese. "This is something P&G would do with or without Kao," says Mr. Zurkuhlen
With economic tension between the U.S. and Japan worsening, many Japanese had feared last week's visit from U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.They expected a new barrage of demands that Japan do something quickly to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S
Instead, they got a discussion of the need for the U.S. and Japan to work together and of the importance of the long-term view.Mrs. Hills' first trip to Japan as America's chief trade negotiator had a completely different tone from last month's visit by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher
Mr. Mosbacher called for concrete results by next spring in negotiations over fundamental Japanese business practices that supposedly inhibit free trade.He said such results should be "measurable in dollars and cents" in reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan
that the objective "is not to get definitive action by spring or summer, it is rather to have a blueprint for action.that she expected "perhaps to have a down payment . . . some small step to convince the American people and the Japanese people that we're moving in earnest
How such remarks translate into policy won't become clear for months.American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills
American and Japanese officials offered several theories for the difference in approach betwen Mr. Mosbacher and Mrs. Hills.Many called it simply a contrast in styles
But some saw it as a classic negotiating tactic.Others said the Bush administration may feel the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand

Mrs. Hills firmly reiterated the need for progress in removing barriers to trade in forest products, satellites and supercomputers, three areas targeted under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill.She highlighted exclusionary business practices that the U.S. government has identified
But her main thrust was to promote the importance of world-wide free trade and open competition.She said the trade imbalance was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and shouldn't be tackled by setting quantitative targets
At her news conference for Japanese reporters, one economics journalist summed up the Japanese sense of relief. "My impression was that you would be a scary old lady," he said
Mrs. Hills' remarks did raise questions, at least among some U.S. officials, about what exactly her stance is on U.S. access to the Japanese semiconductor market.The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck around 10% for years
The U.S. share of the Japanese market has been stuck around 10% for years.Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as assuring U.S. companies a 20% share by 1991, but the Japanese have denied making any such promise

Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago, largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability.The gasoline picture may improve this quarter, but chemicals are likely to remain weak
The industry is "seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals.That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings" for the industry in general

Third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker. "Refining margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year
Oil company refineries ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in July and August that didn't materialize.The excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period
many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter, though still not to the level of 1988's fourth quarter.During the 1988 second half, many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits

it wants to see evidence that all Cocom members are complying fully with existing export-control procedures before it will support further liberalization.To make its point, it is challenging the Italian government to explain reports that Olivetti may have supplied the Soviet Union with sophisticated computer-driven devices that could be used to build parts for combat aircraft
that Olivetti exported $25 million in "embargoed, state-of-the-art, flexible manufacturing systems to the Soviet aviation industry." Olivetti reportedly began shipping these tools in 1984
A State Department spokesman acknowledged that the U.S. is discussing the allegations with the Italian government and Cocom, but declined to confirm any details.Italian President Francesco Cossiga promised a quick investigation into whether Olivetti broke Cocom rules
Italian President Francesco Cossiga promised a quick investigation into whether Olivetti broke Cocom rules.President Bush called his attention to the matter during the Italian leader's visit here last week
the disclosure couldn't be better timed to support the position of export-control hawks in the Pentagon and the intelligence community. "It seems to me that a story like this breaks just before every important Cocom meeting
The Bush administration has sent conflicting signals about its export-control policies, reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies.Last summer, Mr. Bush moved the administration in the direction of gradual liberalization when he told a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that he would allow some exceptions to the Cocom embargo of strategic goods.But more recently, the Pentagon and the Commerce Department openly feuded over the extent to which Cocom should liberalize exports of personal computers to the bloc
However, these agencies generally agree that the West should be cautious about any further liberalization. "There's no evidence that the Soviet program to (illegally) acquire Western technology has diminished

In a suit filed in federal court Thursday, the S&L alleged that a "disproportionate number" of the bonds it purchased in 1984 declined in value.Financial Corp. purchased the bonds, the suit alleged, after Mr. Boesky and Drexel negotiated an agreement for Vagabond Hotels to purchase a 51% stake in the thrift for about $34 million
Vagabond Hotels was controlled by Mr. Boesky, who currently is serving a prison term for securities violations.Officials at Drexel said they hadn't seen the suit and thus couldn't comment
Also named in the suit is Ivan F. Boesky Corp. and Northview Corp., the successor company to Vagabonds Hotels.Northview officials couldn't be located
Financial Corp. said it agreed to buy the bonds after a representative of Ivan F. Boesky Corp. visited it in November 1983 and said Financial Corp. could improve its financial condition by purchasing the bonds.Shortly before the visit, Mr. Boesky and Drexel representives had met with Financial Corp. officials and had signed a letter of intent to acquire the 51% stake in the company

The government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about 66 million bushels.It now estimates production for next year at just under 2.6 billion bushels, compared with this year's estimated 2.04 billion and a drought-stunted 1.81 billion in 1988
But the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being planted won't be felt until the second half of next year.Until then, limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $4-a-bushel level
Until then, limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $4-a-bushel level.On the Chicago Board of Trade Friday, wheat for December delivery settled at $4.0675 a bushel, unchanged
In theory at least, tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market susceptible to a supply-demand squeeze, said Daniel Basse, a futures analyst with AgResource Co. in Chicago.Such a situation can wreak havoc, as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the Chicago Board of Trade
In July, the CBOT ordered Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A. to liquidate futures positions equal to about 23 million bushels of soybeans.it feared that some members wouldn't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their contractual obligation to the Italian conglomerate, which had refused requests to reduce its holdings

Late Thursday, after the close of trading, the market received what would normally have been a bullish U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of the 1989-90 Florida orange crop.It was near the low range of estimates, at 130 million 90-pound boxes, compared with 146.6 million boxes last season
However, as expected, Brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its juice concentrate to about $1.34 a pound from around $1.55.Friday's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the U.S. report might have had and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time
Friday's consequent selling of futures contracts erased whatever supportive effect the U.S. report might have had and sent the November orange juice contract down as much as 6.55 cents a pound at one time.It settled with a loss of 4.95 cents at $1.3210 a pound
Brazilian juice is beginning to arrive in the U.S. in large quantities.Brazil wants to stimulate demand for its product, which is going to be in plentiful supply
The price cut appeared to be aimed even more at Europe, where consumption of Brazilian juice has fallen.It's a dollar-priced product, and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in Europe
New York futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $2 a pound at midyear.Barring a cold snap or other crop problems in the growing areas, downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into January, when harvesting and processing of oranges in Florida reach their peak
Friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets.On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery finished at $20.89 a barrel, up 42 cents on the day
This market still wants to go higher," said Nauman Barakat, a first vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.He predicted that the November contract will reach $21.50 a barrel or more on the New York Mercantile Exchange
There has been little news to account for such buoyancy in the oil markets.Analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible tightening of supplies of some fuels and crudes
There also are recurring reports that the Soviet Union is having difficulties with its oil exports and that Nigeria has about reached its production limit and can't produce as much as it could sell.Many traders foresee a tightening of near-term supplies, particularly of high-quality crudes such as those produced in the North Sea and in Nigeria

GM is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker's U.S. market share skidded during the past decade.The company, currently using about 80% of its North American vehicle capacity, has vowed it will run at 100% of capacity by 1992
The company, currently using about 80% of its North American vehicle capacity, has vowed it will run at 100% of capacity by 1992.Just a month ago, GM announced it would make an aging assembly plant in Lakewood, Ga., the eighth U.S. assembly facility to close since 1987

The problem, however, is that GM's moves are coming at a time when UAW leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs.Against that backdrop, UAW Vice President Stephen P.

Yokich, who recently became head of the union's GM department, issued a statement Friday blasting GM's "flagrant insensitivity" toward union members.The auto maker's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed "disarray" and an "inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information," Mr. Yokich said

But Laura Cunningham's Bronx, her childhood Bronx of the '50s, is something else altogether.In a lovely, novelistic memoir, "Sleeping Arrangements" (Knopf, 195 pages, $18.95), she remembers an exotic playground, peopled mainly by Jewish eccentrics and the occasional Catholic
Ms. Cunningham, a novelist and playwright, has a vivid and dramatically outsized sense of recall.She transforms her "Bronx of the emotions, a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria" into the "Babylonian Bronx," a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue
She transforms her "Bronx of the emotions, a place where the flats of mediocrity are only relieved by steep descents into hysteria" into the "Babylonian Bronx," a world simmering with sex and death and intrigue.In the Babylonian Bronx, Jewish working-class people lived in drab, Soviet-style buildings "glamorized" with names like AnaMor Towers (after owners Anna and Morris Snezak), whose lobbies and hallways were decorated with murals of ancient Syrians and Greeks, friezes of Pompeii
For Ms. Cunningham the architectural discombobulation matched the discrepancy she felt living in the AnaMor Towers as a little girl: ". . . outwardly ordinary, inwardly ornate, owing all inspiration to heathen cultures." Sharp-witted and funny but never mean, she's a memorialist a bit like Truman Capote, if he'd been Jewish and female and less bitchy

Assuming that the market doesn't head into a bottomless free fall, some executives think Friday's action could prove a harbinger of good news -- as a sign that the leveraged buy-out and takeover frenzy of recent years may be abating. "This is a reaction to artificial LBO valuations, rather than to any fundamentals," said John Young, chairman of Hewlett-Packard Co., whose shares dropped $3.125 to $48.125

A few of the executives here for the fall meeting of the Business Council were only too happy to personalize their criticism. "People wish the government would do something about leveraged buy-outs, do something about takeovers, do something about Donald Trump," said Rand Araskog, chairman of ITT Corp., whose stock dropped $3.375

There hasn't been any fundamental change in the economy.The fact that this happened two years ago and there was a recovery gives people some comfort that this won't be a problem
Indeed, one chief executive who was downright delighted by Friday's events was Robert Crandall, chairman of AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines and the target of a takeover offer by Mr. Trump.Asked whether Friday's action could help him avoid being Trumped by the New York real estate magnate, Mr. Crandall smiled broadly and said: "No comment

For the first time, the 83-year-old justice finds his influence almost exclusively in dissent, rather than as a force in the high court's majority.This role reversal holds true, as well, for his three liberal and moderate allies, Justices Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun and John Stevens
Every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role, and the frustrations that go with it, but in different ways.Justices Brennan and Stevens appear philosophical about it; Justices Marshall and Blackmun appear fighting mad
Justices Brennan and Stevens appear philosophical about it; Justices Marshall and Blackmun appear fighting mad
The change is most dramatic for Justice Brennan, the last survivor of the mid-1960s liberal majority under Chief Justice Earl Warren.In the seven Supreme Court terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967, the height of the Warren Court's power, Justice Brennan cast only 25 dissenting votes in 555 cases decided by the court
In the seven Supreme Court terms from the fall of 1962 through the spring of 1967, the height of the Warren Court's power, Justice Brennan cast only 25 dissenting votes in 555 cases decided by the court.Last term alone he cast 52 dissenting votes in 133 decisions
But Justice Brennan foresaw his new role, strongly defending the importance of dissents in a 1985 speech. "Each time the court revisits an issue, the justices will be forced by a dissent to reconsider the fundamental questions and to rethink the result," he said
Moreover, in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s, he knew that the tables might turn in the future.He has said that he now knows how Justice John Harlan felt
but is feisty about his role and determined to speak out against the court's cutbacks in civil rights. "We could sweep it under the rug and hide it, but I'm not going to do it," he said in a speech last month
a point that hasn't escaped legal scholars.Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe says there is a "generation-skipping" flavor to current dissents
Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe says there is a "generation-skipping" flavor to current dissents.The dissenters in the Warren Court, he says, appeared to be writing for the short-term, suggesting that the court's direction might change soon. "Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future," he says
The dissenters in the Warren Court appeared to be writing for the short-term.Brennan and Marshall are speaking in their dissents to a more distant future
Justice Blackmun also seems feisty about his new role.Associates say he takes some defeats more personally than his colleagues
But his level of frustration showed in a recent, impassioned speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in Chicago.He concluded his remarks by quoting, emotionally and at some length, according to those present, the late Martin Luther King's famous "I Have a Dream" speech from the 1963 March on Washington
it also differs in an important way from recent history.The dissenters of the Warren Court were often defending a legal legacy that they inherited but the dissenters today are defending a legacy that they created
Two of the four big thrifts were sold to NCNB Corp., Charlotte, N.C.A Canadian bank bought another thrift, in the first RTC transaction with a foreign bank
Under these deals, the RTC sells just the deposits and the healthy assets.These "clean-bank" transactions leave the bulk of bad assets, mostly real estate, with the government, to be sold later
In these four, for instance, the RTC is stuck with $4.51 billion in bad assets.Acquirers paid premiums ranging from 1.5% to 3.7% for the deposits and branch systems, roughly in line with what analysts were expecting
The buyers will also be locked into deposit rates for just two weeks, as has been the case with previous deals.After that, the buyers may repudiate the rates paid by the former thrifts

Time will "dramatically de-emphasize" its use of electronic giveaways such as telephones in television subscription drives; cut the circulation it guarantees advertisers by 300,000, to four million
In a related development, the news-weekly, for the fourth year in a row, said it won't increase its advertising rates in 1990; a full, four-color page in the magazine costs about $120,000
Time is following the course of some other mass-circulation magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing myth that maintaining artificially high, and expensive, circulations is the way to draw advertisers.In recent years, Reader's Digest, New York Times Co. 's McCall's, and most recently News Corp. 's TV Guide, have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation
Besides, Time executives think selling a news magazine with a clock radio is tacky. "Giveaways just give people the wrong image," said Mr. Heinemann
Giveaways just give people the wrong image.That perception takes the focus off the magazine
Time magazine executives predictably paint the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers. "What we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and don't really read it," said Mr. Heinemann
What we are doing is screening out the readers who are only casually related to the magazine and don't really read it.We are trying to create quality and involvement
Still, Time's move is being received well, once again. "It's terrific for advertisers to know the reader will be paying more," said Michael Drexler, national media director at Bozell Inc. ad agency

the changes represent a new focus in the magazine industry: a magazine's net revenue per subscriber, or the actual revenue from subscribers after discounts and the cost of premiums have been stripped away. "The question is how much are we getting from each reader
Time's rivals news-weeklies, Washington Post Co. 's Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report, are less reliant on electronic giveaways, and in recent years both have been increasing their circulation rate bases.Both magazines are expected to announce their ad rates and circulation levels for 1990 within a month

Just the fact we're on 24 hours is no longer bulletin.You can't live on that
So CNN, a unit of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc., is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel.Tonight, to kick off the effort, CNN will premiere its first prime-time newscast in years, an hourlong show at 6 p.m. Eastern time to air head-to-head against the network newscasts
Tonight, to kick off the effort, CNN will premiere its first prime-time newscast in years, an hourlong show at 6 p.m. Eastern time to air head-to-head against the network newscasts.The show will be co-anchored by Bernard Shaw and Catherine Crier, a 34-year-old former Texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism
The new show is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty.To distinguish itself, CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program
To distinguish itself, CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program.It is paying higher salaries -- after years of scrimping -- to lure and keep experienced staffers
But that won't be easy.Networks, like other consumer products, develop images in peoples' minds that aren't easy to change
The repositioning bid is aimed at CNN's unsteady viewership -- and what may happen to it as the cable-TV news market grows more competitive.Already, CNN is facing stronger competition from Financial News Network Inc. and General Electric Co. 's Consumer News and Business Channel
CNN wants to change its viewers' habits.Its watchers are, on the whole, a disloyal group of channel-zapping "grazers" and news junkies, who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN, according to audience research

That's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks.The brief attention viewers give CNN could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data, and advertising, become more important to cable-TV channels

It focused on building up its news bureaus around the world, so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks.It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called "Daybreak," "Daywatch," "Newsday," and "Newsnight," but the shows varied little in content, personality or look
Now, the push is on for more-distinctive shows. "Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity
Then there's "The World Today," the prime-time newscast featuring Mr. Shaw and Ms. Crier.Until now, CNN has featured its Hollywood gossip show during the key evening period
But 70% of the cable-television-equipped households that watch news do so between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m., the network discovered, so CNN wants in.Mr. Amos says the Shaw-Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day, with most of the program, at least for now, appearing similar to CNN's other newcasts
Some in the industry are skeptical. "I find it hard to conceive of people switching over to CNN for what, at least in the public's mind, is the same news," says Reuven Frank, the former two-time president of NBC News and creator of the Huntley-Brinkley Report
The evening news is also slated as CNN's stage for its big push into investigative journalism.In August, the network hired award-winning producer Pamela Hill, the former head of news specials at ABC

She's assembling a staff of about 35 investigative reporters who will produce weekly, in-depth segments, with an eye toward breaking big stories.the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its "branded" programs, in the way "60 Minutes" did so well for CBS
that many in the industry are skeptical CNN will follow through with its investigative commitment, especially after it sees the cost of producing in-depth pieces.

All year, energy prices have skewed the producer price index, which measures changes in the prices producers receive for goods.Inflation unquestionably has fallen back from its torrid pace last winter, when a steep run-up in world oil prices sent the index surging at double-digit annual rates
Overall, the index has climbed at a 5.1% compound annual rate since the start of the year.While far more restrained than the pace at the beginning of the year, that is still a steeper rise than the 4.0% increase for all of 1988
Moreover, this year's good inflation news may have ended last month, when energy prices zoomed up 6.5% after plunging 7.3% in August.Some analysts expect oil prices to remain relatively stable in the months ahead, leaving the future pace of inflation uncertain

David L. Paul, chairman and chief executive officer, criticized the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, which issued the directive, saying it was "inappropriate" and based on "insufficient" reasons.He said the thrift will try to get regulators to reverse the decision
In March, regulators labeled CenTrust a "troubled institution," largely because of its big junk-bond holdings and its operating losses.In the same month, the Office of Thrift Supervision ordered the institution to stop paying common stock dividends until its operations were on track
For the nine months ended June 30, CenTrust had a net loss of $21.3 million, compared with year-earlier net income of $52.8 million.CenTrust, which is Florida's largest thrift, holds one of the largest junk-bond portfolios of any thrift in the nation

only about $150 million of the current holdings are tradeable securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.The remainder are commercial loan participations, or private placements, that aren't filed with the SEC and don't have a ready market
CenTrust and regulators have been in a dispute over market valuations for the junk bonds.The Office of Thrift Supervision has been hounding CenTrust to provide current market values for its holdings, but CenTrust has said it can't easily obtain such values because of the relative illiquidity of the bonds and lack of a ready market
Regulators have become increasingly antsy about CenTrust's and other thrifts' junk-bond holdings in light of the recent federal thrift bailout legislation and the recent deep decline in the junk-bond market.The legislation requires thrifts to divest themselves of junk bonds in the new, somber regulatory climate
The branch sale is the centerpiece of CenTrust's strategy to transform itself into a traditional S&L from a high-flying institution that relied heavily on securities trading for profits, according to Mr. Paul.Most analysts and thrift executives had expected a decision on the proposed transaction long before now

CenTrust, however, touts the branch sale, saying it would bring in $150 million and reduce the thrift's assets to $6.7 billion from $9 billion.It said the sale would give it positive tangible capital of $82 million, or about 1.2% of assets, from a negative $33 million as of Sept. 30, thus bringing CenTrust close to regulatory standards
The most militant opposition to American TV imports has come from French television and movie producers, who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full 60% of Europe's TV shows be produced in Europe.So far, the French have failed to win enough broad-based support to prevail

Already, British Aerospace and French government-controlled Thomson-CSF collaborate on a British missile contract and on an air-traffic control radar system.Just last week they announced they may make a joint bid to buy Ferranti International Signal PLC, a smaller British defense contractor rocked by alleged accounting fraud at a U.S. unit
The sudden romance of British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF -- traditionally bitter competitors for Middle East and Third World weapons contracts -- is stirring controversy in Western Europe's defense industry.Most threatened by closer British Aerospace-Thomson ties would be their respective national rivals, including Matra S.A. in France and Britain's General Electric Co. PLC
Yesterday, a source close to GEC confirmed that his company may join the Ferranti fight, as part of a possible consortium that would bid against British Aerospace and Thomson-CSF.Companies with which GEC has had talks about a possible joint Ferranti bid include Matra, Britain's Dowty Group PLC, West Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, and France's Dassault group
But it may be weeks before GEC and its potential partners decide whether to bid.GEC plans first to study Ferranti's financial accounts
Also, any GEC bid might be blocked by British antitrust regulators; Ferranti is GEC's main competitor on several key defense-electronics contracts, and its purchase by GEC may heighten British Defense Ministry worries about concentration in the country's defense industry
it isn't interested in Ferranti. "We have nothing to say about this affair, which doesn't concern us," a Matra official said Sunday
The missile venture is a needed response to the "new environment" in defense contracting.For both Thomson and British Aerospace, earnings in their home markets have come under pressure from increasingly tight-fisted defense ministries
The venture's importance for Thomson is great.the future of its defense business depends on building cooperation with other Europeans

that Canadian oil output will total about 1.64 million barrels a day by 1991, 8% lower than a previous estimate.Canadian crude production averaged about 1.69 million barrels a day during 1989's first half, about 1% below the 1988 level
The capability of existing fields to deliver oil is dropping," and oil exploration activity is also down dramatically, as many producers shift their emphasis to natural gas.volume on Interprovincial's system is down about 2% since January and is expected to fall further, making expansion unnecessary until perhaps the mid-1990s
the outlook for natural gas is better than it is for oil, and have shifted their exploration and development budgets accordingly.The number of active drilling rigs in Canada is down 30% from a year ago, and the number of completed oil wells is "down more than that, due to the increasing focus on gas exploration
Mr. Watkins said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature, conventional fields in western Canada.Interprovincial transports about 75% of all crude produced in western Canada, and almost 60% of Interprovincial's total volume consists of light crude
Canada's current oil exports to the U.S. total about 600,000 barrels a day, or about 9.1% of net U.S. crude imports.That ranks Canada as the fourth-largest source of imported crude, behind Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and Mexico
Mr. Lichtblau said Canada's declining crude output, combined with the fast-shrinking output of U.S. crude, will help intensify U.S. reliance on oil from overseas, particularly the Middle East. "It's very much a growing concern

IOWA IS MAKING a comeback.So are Indiana, Ohio and Michigan.The population of all four states is on the upswing, according to new Census Bureau estimates, following declines throughout the early 1980s
Between 1987 and 1988, North Dakota was the only state in the Midwest to lose population, a loss of 4,000 people.Six of the 12 midwestern states have been growing steadily since 1980 -- Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, South Dakota and Wisconsin
The Northeast has been holding its own in the population race.Seven of nine states have grown each year since 1980
At the same time, several states in the South and West have had their own population turnaround.Seven states that grew in the early 1980s are now losing population
And even after losing a spouse, more of the elderly are staying independent.A new Census Bureau study of the noninstitutionalized population shows that 64% of people aged 65 to 74 were living with a spouse in 1988, up from 59% in 1970

What has changed is that more of the young elderly are living with spouses rather than with other relatives, such as children.In 1988, 10% of those aged 65 to 74 lived with relatives other than spouses, down from 15% in 1970
Like their younger counterparts, the older elderly are less likely to live with other relatives.Only 17% of those aged 75 and older lived with relatives other than spouses in 1988, down from 26% in 1970
The likelihood of living alone beyond the age of 75 has increased to 40% from 32%.More people are remaining independent longer presumably because they are better off physically and financially

Unlike most studies of the affluent market, this survey excluded the super-rich.Average household income for the sample was $194,000, and average net assets were reported as $775,000
The goal was to learn about one of today's fastest-growing income groups, the upper-middle class.Although they represent only 2% of the population, they control nearly one-third of discretionary income
Despite their considerable incomes and assets, 40% of the respondents in the study don't feel financially secure, and one-fourth don't feel that they have made it.Twenty percent don't even feel they are financially well off

More than 30 years ago, Prof.Harold Hill, the con man in Meredith Willson's "The Music Man," warned the citizens of River City, Iowa, against the game.Now kindred spirits on Addison's town council have barred the town's fanciest hotel, the Grand Kempinski, from installing three free pool tables in its new lounge
The council's action is yet another blow to a sport that its fans claim has been maligned unjustly for years. "Obviously they're not in touch with what's going on
Obviously they're not in touch with what's going on.Pool is hot in New York and Chicago where "upscale, suit-and-tie places" are adding tables
Pool is hot in New York and Chicago, he insists, where "upscale, suit-and-tie places" are adding tables.With today's tougher drunk driving laws people don't want to just sit around and drink
where rooms average $200 a night and the cheap mixed drinks go for $3.50 a pop.At the lounge, manager Elizabeth Dyer won't admit patrons in jeans, T-shirts or tennis shoes
But a majority of the Addison council didn't buy those arguments.Introducing pool, argued Councilwoman Riley Reinker, would be "dangerous
Introducing pool would be "dangerous.It would open a can of worms
Addison is no stranger to cans of worms, either.After its previous mayor committed suicide last year, an investigation disclosed that town officials regularly voted on their own projects, gave special favors to developer friends and dipped into the town's coffers for trips and retreats
The revelations embarrassed town officials, although they argued that the problems weren't as severe as the media suggested.Now comes the pool flap
I think there's some people worried about something pretty ridiculous.I thought this was all taken care of in `The Music Man

Of all the ethnic tensions in America, which is the most troublesome right now?A good bet would be the tension between blacks and Jews in New York City
Or so it must seem to Jackie Mason, the veteran Jewish comedian appearing in a new ABC sitcom airing on Tuesday nights (9:30-10 p.m. EDT).Not only is Mr. Mason the star of "Chicken Soup," he's also the inheritor of a comedic tradition dating back to "Duck Soup
Here, in neutral language, is the gist of Mr. Mason's remarks, quoted first in the Village Voice.Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks, so they support black candidates uncritically
Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks, so they support black candidates uncritically.He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination, so they, too, support black candidates uncritically
He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination, so they, too, support black candidates uncritically.He said that Jews have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice versa
Of course, Mr. Mason did not use neutral language.As a practitioner of ethnic humor from the old days on the Borscht Belt, live television and the nightclub circuit, Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular
Mr. Mason instinctively reached for the vernacular.He said Jews were "sick with complexes
that Mr. Mason is "like a dinosaur.People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck
These critics fail to distinguish between the type of ethnic humor that aims at disparaging another group, such as "Polish jokes"; and the type that is double-edged, aiming inward as well as outward.The latter typically is the humor of the underdog, and it was perfected by both blacks and Jews on the minstrel and vaudeville stage as a means of mocking their white and gentile audiences along with themselves
But wielded by a pro like Jackie Mason, it is a constructive form of mischief.Why constructive
Because despite all the media prattle about comedy and politics not mixing, they are similar in one respect: Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict
Both can serve as mechanisms for easing tensions and facilitating the co-existence of groups in conflict.That's why it's dangerous to have well-intentioned thought police, on college campuses and elsewhere, taboo all critical mention of group differences
Perhaps intolerance would not boil over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to simmer." The question is, if group conflicts still exist (as undeniably they do), and if Mr. Mason's type of ethnic humor is passe, then what other means do we have for letting off steam
Don't say the TV sitcom, because that happens to be a genre that, in its desperate need to attract everybody and offend nobody, resembles politics more than it does comedy.It is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer
In "Chicken Soup," Mr. Mason plays Jackie, a Jewish bachelor courting Maddie (Lynn Redgrave), an Irish widow and mother of three, against the wishes of his mother (Rita Karin) and her brother Michael (Brandon Maggart).It's worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants
It's worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants.At least, they both speak with strong accents, as do Jackie and Maddie
At least, they both speak with strong accents, as do Jackie and Maddie.It couldn't be more obvious that "Chicken Soup" is being made from an old recipe
Clearly, the question with "Chicken Soup" is not whether the pot will boil over, but whether it will simmer at all.So far, the bubbles have been few and far between
So far, the bubbles have been few and far between.Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms to preach about social issues
Part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms to preach about social issues.To some extent, this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to enlighten us about ethnic stereotypes by reversing them
For instance, Michael dislikes Jackie not because he's a shrewd Jewish businessman, but because he quits his well-paying job as a salesman in order to become a social worker.Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason's comic persona
Even more problematic is the incompatibility between sitcom preachiness and Mr. Mason's comic persona.The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end (and occasionally in the middle), when Mr. Mason slips into his standup mode and starts meting out that old-fashioned Jewish mischief to other people as well as to himself
I'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the Catholic-Jewish dispute over the Carmelite convent at Auschwitz.That issue, like racial tensions in New York City, will have to cool down, not heat up, before it can simmer
But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to interrupt his classic shtik with some line about "caring for other people" that would sound shmaltzy on the lips of Miss America.At your age, Jackie, you ought to know that you can't make soup without turning up the flame

Late Friday night, the Senate voted 87-7 to approve an estimated $13.5 billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened, rather than narrowed, the federal budget deficit.Lawmakers drastically streamlined the bill to blunt criticism that it was bloated with special-interest tax breaks and spending increases
In addition, the companion deficit-reduction bill already passed by the House includes a capital-gains provision.House-Senate negotiations are likely to begin at midweek and last for a while
that the administration wouldn't push to keep the capital-gains cut in the final version of the bill. "We don't need this as a way to get capital gains
The Senate's decision was a setback for President Bush and will make approval of a capital-gains tax cut less certain this year.Opponents of the cut are playing hardball
Opponents of the cut are playing hardball.Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D., Maine) said he was "confident" that any House-Senate agreement on the deficit-reduction legislation wouldn't include a capital-gains tax cut
One obvious place to attach a capital-gains tax cut, and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit-reduction bill, is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit.Such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month
The Senate bill was pared back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through Congress.Because the legislation hasn't been completed, President Bush has until midnight tonight to enact across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law
Senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the House to agree to the streamlined bill.The House appears reluctant to join the senators
The House appears reluctant to join the senators.A key is whether House Republicans are willing to acquiesce to their Senate colleagues' decision to drop many pet provisions
Another big question hovering over the debate is what President Bush thinks.He has been resisting a stripped-down bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut
The Senate bill was stripped of many popular, though revenue-losing, provisions.These include a child-care initiative and extensions of soon-to-expire tax breaks for low-income housing and research-and-development expenditures
One high-profile provision that was originally in the Senate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) of the Senate Finance Committee to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts.Mr. Bentsen said he hopes the Senate will consider that measure soon
To the delight of some doctors, the bill dropped a plan passed by the Finance Committee that would have overhauled the entire physician-reimbursement system under Medicare.To the detriment of many low-income people, efforts to boost Medicaid funding, especially in rural areas, also were stricken
We're looking like idiots.Things had just gone too far
that the move required sacrifice by every senator.It worked because there were no exceptions
In addition, the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a 3% excise tax on long-distance telephone calls.It no longer includes a plan that would have repealed what remains of the completed-contract method of accounting
Also stricken was a fivefold increase in the maximum Occupational Safety and Health Administration penalties.A provision that would have made the Social Security Administration an independent agency was excised
The approval of the Senate bill was especially sweet for Sen. Mitchell.Mr. Mitchell's relations with Budget Director Darman have been strained since Mr. Darman chose to bypass the Maine Democrat and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal 1989 supplemental spending bill
The deficit reduction bill contains $5.3 billion in tax increases in fiscal 1990, and $26 billion over five years.The revenue-raising provisions, which affect mostly corporations, would: -- Prevent companies that have made leveraged buy-outs from getting federal tax refunds resulting from losses caused by interest payments on debt issued to finance the buy-outs, effective Aug. 2, 1989. -- Require mutual funds to include in their taxable income dividends paid to them on the date that the dividends are declared rather than received, effective the day after the tax bill is enacted. -- Close a loophole regarding employee stock ownership plans, effective June 6, 1989, that has been exploited by investment bankers in corporate takeovers.The measure repeals a 50% exclusion given to banks on the interest from loans used to acquire securities for an ESOP, if the ESOP owns less than 30% of the employer's stock. -- Curb junk bonds by ending tax benefits for certain securities, such as zero-coupon bonds, that postpone cash interest payments. -- Raise $851 million by suspending for one year an automatic reduction in airport and airway taxes. -- Speed up the collection of the payroll tax from large companies, effective August 1990. -- Impose a tax on ozone-depleting chemicals, such as those used in air conditioners and in Styrofoam, beginning at $1.10 a pound starting next year. -- Withhold income taxes from the paychecks of certain farm workers currently exempt from withholding. -- Change the collection of gasoline excise taxes to weekly from semimonthly, effective next year. -- Restrict the ability of real estate owners to escape taxes by swapping one piece of property for another instead of selling it for cash. -- Increase to $6 a person from $3 the international air-passenger departure tax, and impose a $3-a-person tax on international departures by commercial ships

No, to my mind, the Journal did not "defend sleaze, fraud, waste, embezzlement, influence-peddling and abuse of the public trust . . ." it defended appropriate constitutional safeguards and practical common sense

The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person "shall be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself." This privilege against self-incrimination precludes the drawing of an adverse inference against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify
Thus, in a civil case, a defendant may be called as a witness, he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth, and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse inference against him in the civil matter.He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution
He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution.Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one's testimony harms him in the civil matter, but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution
Allowing the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one's testimony harms him in the civil matter, but because the testimony in the civil matter could be unconstitutionally used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.Absent the risk of such prosecution, a court may order the defendant to testify
one must conclude that he held a good-faith, justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.The subcommittee, Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime
Thus, when Mr. Pierce asserted the Fifth in a noncriminal proceeding, particularly after presumably receiving extensive advice from legal counsel, one must conclude that he held a good-faith, justifiable belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.The subcommittee, Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse inference and to concur with Mr. Pierce's own belief that his testimony could help convict him of a crime.Drawing the adverse inference in a noncriminal congressional hearing does not offend the Fifth Amendment shield against self-incrimination

Most of the complaints about unanswered phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors.Mr. King of Robinson-Humphrey and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders' inability to handle the volume of calls, rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid making trades

Other money managers also opened their wallets. "I was buying at the close (Friday) and I'll be buying again because I know we're getting good value," said Frederick A. Moran, president of Moran Asset Management Inc., Greenwich, Conn
I was buying at the close (Friday) and I'll be buying again because I know we're getting good value.There is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash
big investors such as pension funds and insurance companies can decide to ride out market storms without jettisoning stock.Most often, they do just that
The last crash taught institutional investors that they have to be long-term holders, and that they can't react to short-term events, good or bad.Those that pulled out (of stocks) regretted it
Stocks, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, have been stellar performers this year, rising 27.97% before Friday's plunge, excluding dividends.Even Friday's slump leaves investors ahead more than 20%, well above the annual average for stocks over several decades
Mr. Awad, however, worries that the market "could go down 800 or 900 points in the next few days.It can happen before you can turn around
It can happen before you can turn around." He said he discerns many parallels with 1987, including the emphasis on takeover stocks and the re-emergence of computerized program trading

Most institutional investors have abandoned the portfolio insurance hedging technique, which is widely thought to have worsened the 1987 crash.Not really insurance, this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of S&P futures contracts
Not really insurance, this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of S&P futures contracts.In its severest test, the $60 billion of portfolio insurance in effect in the 1987 crash didn't work, as stock buyers disappeared and stock and futures prices became disconnected
Even without portfolio insurance, market conditions were grim Friday.Neil Weisman said he was besieged by Wall Street firms Friday asking him to take stock off their hands
stocks will appear to stabilize in the next few days before declining again, trapping more investors. "I think it will be a rigor mortis rally
Meanwhile, Friday brought a reprieve for money managers whose investment styles had put them at odds with the market rally.Especially gleeful were the short sellers, who have been pounded by this year's market climb
The shorts sell borrowed shares, hoping to profit by replacing them later at a lower price.The nation's largest short-selling operation is Feshbach Brothers, Palo Alto, Calif., which said last May that its short positions had shown losses of 10% for the year up to that point
All that now has changed. "We're ahead for the year because of Friday
We're ahead for the year because of Friday.We're not making a killing, but we had a good day
Neither Vitarine nor any of the Springfield Gardens, N.Y., company's officials or employees have been charged with any crimes.Vitarine won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it substituted a SmithKline Beecham PLC product as its own in tests

Should the courts uphold the validity of this type of defense, ASKO will then ask the court to overturn such a vote-diluting maneuver recently deployed by Koninklijke Ahold NV. ASKO says the Dutch-based international food retailer hadn't reasonable grounds to issue preferred stock to a friendly trust and thus dilute the worth and voting power of ASKO and other shareholders
A spokesman for Ahold said his company is confident of its own position and the propriety of the preferred-share issue.He termed ASKO's legal actions as "unproductive" to international cooperation among European retailers

By 11:59 p.m. tonight, President Bush must order $16 billion of automatic, across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply with the Gramm-Rudman budget law.The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a deficit-cutting bill

And he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines.Some analysts say uncertainty about Washington's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through
In many ways, the backdrop to Friday's stock decline is eerily similar to that of October 1987's 508-point crash.Then, as now, the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold.The Treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy, although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the Federal Reserve.And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee rather than the Transportation Department -- were making markets nervous
Then, as now, the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold.The Treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy
But a similar outcome doesn't seem likely this year.Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday's drop, by itself, isn't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement
the economy and the market can survive a one-day 508-point tumble. "Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of 1929, that we were looking at a recession That did not happen
Everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of 1929, that we were looking at a recession.That did not happen

In that case, there will be plenty of blame to go around. "There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut
there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds.At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was the president's policy to include it
Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood, the ranking GOP member of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, hailed it.Asked if the administration agreed, he curtly replied: "The adminstration will have to speak for itself
The White House Office of Management and Budget, whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met, estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 shortfall by $6.2 billion, almost half of the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of $11.0 billion.Rep. Panetta said that OMB's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts, but added: "We're getting very close to the margins here
But some players were quick to seize the moment.Before the sun had set on Friday, Richard Rahn, the supply-side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains
Before the sun had set on Friday, Richard Rahn, the supply-side chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, issued a statement attributing the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains.

Some evinced an optimism that had been rewarded when they didn't flee the market in 1987. "Oh, I bet it'll be up 50 points on Monday," said Lucy Crump, a 78-year-old retired housewife in Lexington, Ky
Oh, I bet it'll be up 50 points on Monday," said Lucy Crump, a 78-year-old retired housewife in Lexington, Ky.Mrs. Crump said her Ashwood Investment Club's portfolio lost about one-third of its value following the Black Monday crash, "but no one got discouraged, and we gained that back -- and more
At the annual congress of the National Association of Investors Corp. at the Hyatt Regency hotel in Minneapolis, the scene was calm.Some 500 investors representing investor clubs from around the U.S. were attending when the market started to slide Friday
In fact, some of the association's members welcomed the drop in prices. "We hope to take advantage of it
We hope to take advantage of it," said John Snyder, a member of a Los Angeles investors' club.He has four stocks in mind to buy if the prices drop to the level he wants

Others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand. "We all assumed October '87 was a one-time shot," said San Francisco attorney David Greenberg

Compaq's series of notebooks extends a trend toward downsizing in the personal computer market.One manufacturer already has produced a clipboard-sized computer called a notepad, and two others have introduced even smaller "palmtops
Compaq's notebooks, by contrast, may be the first in their weight class not to skimp on features found in much bigger machines.Analysts say they're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market
Analysts say they're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market -- and they're priced aggressively at $2,400 to $5,000.All of this comes in a machine that weighs only six pounds and fits comfortably into most briefcases
and that are called notebooks -- perhaps misleadingly.One analyst, noting that most such machines are about two inches thick, takes exception to the name
One analyst, noting that most such machines are about two inches thick, takes exception to the name. "This isn't quite a notebook -- I call it a phonebook

Instead of a keyboard, it features a writing surface, an electronic pen and the ability to "read" block printing.At 4 1/2 pounds, it may be too ambitiously named, but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts froth
Palmtops aren't far behind.Atari Corp. 's Portfolio weighs less than a pound, costs a mere $400 and runs on three AA batteries, yet has the power to run some spreadsheets and word processing programs
At stake is what Mike Swavely, Compaq's president of North America operations, calls "the Holy Grail of the computer industry" -- the search for "a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere." The market is so new, nobody knows yet how big it can be

Consider the growth of portables, which now comprise 12% of all personal computer sales.Laptops have become the fastest-growing personal computer segment, with sales doubling this year
Responding to that demand, however, has led to a variety of compromises.Making computers smaller often means sacrificing memory
A Poquet spokesman, for example, criticizes the Atari Portfolio because it requires three batteries while the Poquet needs only two.Both palmtops are dismissed by notebook makers, who argue that they're too small
a problem Poquet also encountered in focus groups.Poquet, trying to avoid the "gadget" label, responded with the tag line, "The Poquet PC -- a Very Big Computer
Despite the sniping, few question the inevitability of the move to small machines that don't make compromises.Toward that end the real battle will take place between center-stage players like Toshiba, Zenith and now Compaq
Compaq's announcement also spells trouble for Zenith, which last year had 28% of the U.S. laptop market but recently agreed to sell its computer business to Cie. des Machines Bull, the French government-owned computer maker.Zenith holders will vote in December on the proposed $635 million sale, a price that could slip because it is pegged to Zenith's share and sales
Compaq is already taking aim at Zenith's market share.Rod Canion, Compaq's president and chief executive officer, notes pointedly that Zenith's $2,000 MinisPort uses an "unconventional" two-inch floppy disk, whereas Compaq's new machines use the more common 3 1/2-inch disk

Frank, president of Zenith Data Systems, simply shrugs off such criticism
that 3 1/2-inch floppies were also "unconventional" when they first replaced five-inch disks. "We don't look at it as not being a standard, we look at it as a new standard

Toshiba's line of portables, for example, features the T-1000, which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory, and the T-1600, which also uses a 286 microprocessor, but which weighs almost twice as much and is three times the size.A third model, marketed in Japan, may hit the U.S. by the end of the first quarter of 1990, but by then Compaq will have established itself as one of three major players
And among the issues hitting new highs were Detroit Edison Co. and Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. Other major issues hitting highs included American Telephone & Telegraph Co., Westinghouse Electric Corp., Exxon Corp. and Cigna Corp., the big insurer
Of course, many more issues -- 93 -- hit new lows.These included International Business Machines Corp., which during Friday's session traded below $100 a share for the first time since June 1984

That's because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans.In October 1987, these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the downward spiral of the stock market
Typically, a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below 75% of its original value.If the investor doesn't put up the extra cash to satisfy the call, the brokerage firm may begin liquidating the securities
But some big brokerage firms said they don't expect major problems as a result of margin calls.Margin calls since Friday "have been higher than usual, but reasonable," a spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said
he didn't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for Schwab customers.He said Schwab had increased margin requirements

Industry estimates put Avis's annual cost of all five programs at between $8 million and $14 million.A spokesman for Avis wouldn't specify the costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for "far less than half" of the total
I cannot see how this news by Hertz and Avis cannot benefit Budget's programs.Northwest and Midway are two of the five airlines with which Budget has agreements
Analysts and competitors, however, doubt the numbers were that high.Budget said its frequent-flier costs are "substantially below" Avis's level

Tandem said it expects to report revenue of about $450 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share.The results, which are in line with analysts' estimates, reflect "a continued improvement in our U.S. business," said James Treybig, Tandem's chief executive officer
Tandem expects to report the full results for the quarter next week.Analysts have predicted that the Cupertino, Calif., company will report revenue of $430 million to $460 million and earnings of 35 cents to 40 cents a share
Tandem makes "fault-tolerant" computers -- machines with built-in backup systems -- that run stock exchanges, networks of automatic tellers and other complex computer systems.Tomorrow the company is scheduled to announce its most powerful computer ever, which for the first time will bring it into direct competition with makers of mainframe computers
Tandem's new high-end computer is called Cyclone.Prices for the machine, which can come in various configurations, are $2 million to $10 million
We believe they could siphon perhaps two to three billion dollars from IBM" over the next few years, said George Weiss, an analyst at the Gartner group.That will spur Tandem's growth
That will spur Tandem's growth. "I'd be disappointed if the company grew by less than 20% next year
IBM is expected to respond to Tandem's Cyclone by discounting its own mainframes, which analysts say are roughly three times the price of a comparable system from Tandem. "Obviously IBM can give bigger discounts to users immediately," said Mr. Weiss
But Mr. Treybig questions whether that will be enough to stop Tandem's first mainframe from taking on some of the functions that large organizations previously sought from Big Blue's machines. "The answer isn't price reductions, but new systems
Nevertheless, Tandem faces a variety of challenges, the biggest being that customers generally view the company's computers as complementary to IBM's mainframes.Even Mr. Treybig is reluctant to abandon this notion, insisting that Tandem's new machines aren't replacements for IBM's mainframes
Don't jump yet.The stock market's swoon may turn out to be good news for the economy

The Fed is now poised to pour money into the economy if needed to soothe the markets.Fed officials may protest that this doesn't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies
Anticipating the Fed's move, money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the Federal Funds rate to 8.625% late Friday, down from 8.820% the day before.Tiny movements in the rate, which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans, are usually among the few visible tracks that the Fed leaves on the monetary markets
The dollar also began to decline Friday as the stock market's plunge caused some investors to reassess their desire to invest in the U.S. Treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar's strength was out of whack with economic fundamentals
Treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar's strength was out of whack with economic fundamentals.The market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the Treasury was right about the overpriced dollar
A modest drop in the dollar -- only a modest one, mind you -- would be welcomed by the U.S.That wasn't the case in 1987, when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse, producing panic among foreign investors and diminishing the flow of foreign capital to the U.S
Another big difference between 1987 and 1989 isn't so comforting.In the third quarter of 1987, the economy spurted at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 5.3%.The consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish 2.3% in the third quarter of 1989, which ended two weeks ago

The economy does, however, depend on the confidence of businesses, consumers and foreign investors.A panic on Wall Street doesn't exactly inspire confidence
Surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before Friday.A 190-point drop isn't likely to make much of a dent
multiply that a few times over, though, and it will.If the reactions of executives gathered Saturday at Hot Springs, Va., for the Business Council meetings are typical, business leaders weren't overly rattled by Friday's decline

For some of these companies, this will be the first quarter with year-to-year negative comparisons.This could be the first of five or six down quarters
Perhaps most prominent, Dow Chemical Co is expected to report that profit decreased in the latest quarter from a year earlier, if only by a shade.Though Dow has aggressively diversified into specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals, the company still has a big stake in polyethylene
Analysts' third-quarter estimates for the Midland, Mich., company are between $3.20 a share and $3.30 a share, compared with $3.36 a year ago, when profit was $632 million on sales of $4.15 billion.A Dow spokeswoman declined to comment on the estimates
At the investment firm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., the commodity-chemical segment is seen pulling down overall profit for 20 companies representative of the whole industry by 8% to 10%. "You will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better," says James Wilbur, a Smith Barney analyst
First Boston Corp. projects that 10 of the 15 companies it follows will report lower profit.Most of the 10 have big commodity-chemical operations
Still, some industry giants are expected to report continuing gains, largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals.Du Pont Co. is thought to have had steady profit growth in white pigments, fibers and polymers
Analysts are divided over whether Du Pont will report much of a gain in the latest quarter from its Conoco Inc. oil company.The estimates for Du Pont range from $2.25 to $2.45 a share

Monsanto Co., too, is expected to continue reporting higher profit, even though its sales of crop chemicals were hurt in the latest quarter by drought in northern Europe and the western U.S.The St. Louis-based company is expected to report again that losses in its G.D.
